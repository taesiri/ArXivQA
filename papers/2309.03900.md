# [Learning Continuous Exposure Value Representations for Single-Image HDR   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03900)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we improve single-image HDR reconstruction by generating LDR images with continuous exposure values? The key hypothesis is that generating an enriched LDR stack with more images containing diverse, dense, and continuous exposure values (EVs), will significantly improve HDR reconstruction compared to using a sparse set of predefined EVs.Specifically, the paper proposes:- Continuous Exposure Value Representation (CEVR) to generate LDR images with continuous EVs using an implicit neural function.- Cycle training strategy to train CEVR to generate continuous EV images without direct supervision.- Continuous stack with dense EVs from CEVR to improve HDR reconstruction.The main hypothesis is that the flexibility of generating continuous EVs and using a dense continuous stack will allow better HDR reconstruction than relying on sparse, predefined EVs as in previous methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CEVR model and strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The proposed Continuous Exposure Value Representation (CEVR) method, which uses an implicit neural function to generate LDR images with continuous exposure values (EVs). 2. The cycle training strategy, which helps train the CEVR model to synthesize images with arbitrary EVs without corresponding ground truth images.3. The continuous stack, which contains additional synthesized LDR images with dense/continuous EVs to improve the quality of the final reconstructed HDR image.In summary, the key ideas are using an implicit neural function to enable continuous EV modeling, a cycle training method to learn generating images with unseen EVs, and leveraging the flexibility to synthesize a dense continuous EV stack to improve HDR reconstruction. The proposed CEVR method with the two strategies significantly outperforms existing single image HDR reconstruction methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Continuous Exposure Value Representation (CEVR) that uses an implicit neural function to generate LDR images with continuous exposure values, and leverages strategies like cycle training and continuous stacking to improve single-image HDR reconstruction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in single-image HDR reconstruction:- The key novelty of this paper is the proposed continuous exposure value representation (CEVR) model, which leverages an implicit neural function to generate LDR images with continuous/arbitrary exposure values (EVs). This allows creating a dense LDR image stack with diverse EVs for high-quality HDR reconstruction. - Most prior work like Deep recursive HDRI, DrTMO, etc. can only generate LDR stacks with a predefined, sparse set of EVs based on the training data. They are limited by the availability of ground truth LDR images with those EVs during training. This paper's CEVR overcomes that limitation.- Another novel contribution is the proposed cycle training strategy. It provides supervision for continuous EVs without corresponding ground truths by enforcing cycle consistency. This further improves CEVR's ability to synthesize images across a range of EVs.- The continuous LDR stack with dense EVs estimated by CEVR also helps existing multi-image HDR fusion techniques like Debevec's method to estimate more accurate inverse camera response functions and reconstruct better HDR images.- Experiments show state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results compared to recent approaches like Deep recursive HDRI, DrTMO, Liu et al. on benchmark datasets. The generalizability of CEVR to unseen data is also demonstrated.In summary, this paper presents a new continuous EV representation and training strategy for single-image HDR reconstruction that outperforms prior predefined EV-based approaches. The ability to synthesize arbitrary EVs and create dense LDR stacks leads to improved HDR image quality.
