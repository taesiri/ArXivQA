# [Learning Continuous Exposure Value Representations for Single-Image HDR   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03900)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we improve single-image HDR reconstruction by generating LDR images with continuous exposure values? The key hypothesis is that generating an enriched LDR stack with more images containing diverse, dense, and continuous exposure values (EVs), will significantly improve HDR reconstruction compared to using a sparse set of predefined EVs.Specifically, the paper proposes:- Continuous Exposure Value Representation (CEVR) to generate LDR images with continuous EVs using an implicit neural function.- Cycle training strategy to train CEVR to generate continuous EV images without direct supervision.- Continuous stack with dense EVs from CEVR to improve HDR reconstruction.The main hypothesis is that the flexibility of generating continuous EVs and using a dense continuous stack will allow better HDR reconstruction than relying on sparse, predefined EVs as in previous methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CEVR model and strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The proposed Continuous Exposure Value Representation (CEVR) method, which uses an implicit neural function to generate LDR images with continuous exposure values (EVs). 2. The cycle training strategy, which helps train the CEVR model to synthesize images with arbitrary EVs without corresponding ground truth images.3. The continuous stack, which contains additional synthesized LDR images with dense/continuous EVs to improve the quality of the final reconstructed HDR image.In summary, the key ideas are using an implicit neural function to enable continuous EV modeling, a cycle training method to learn generating images with unseen EVs, and leveraging the flexibility to synthesize a dense continuous EV stack to improve HDR reconstruction. The proposed CEVR method with the two strategies significantly outperforms existing single image HDR reconstruction methods.
