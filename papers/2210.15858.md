## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Vox-Fusion: Dense Tracking and Mapping with Voxel-based Neural Implicit Representation":

Problem:
- Dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) aims to track camera poses and reconstruct dense 3D maps of environments in real-time. 
- Traditional SLAM methods using geometric primitives like voxels struggle to render novel views and modify maps on-the-fly. 
- Learning-based SLAM methods using neural networks struggle to generalize and scale.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Vox-Fusion, a SLAM system combining a sparse voxel octree structure with neural implicit representations to achieve scalable and detailed reconstruction.
- Use a neural decoder and voxel embeddings to represent scene geometry and appearance locally inside voxels.
- Perform tracking by optimizing poses via differentiable volume rendering losses.
- Select keyframes based on ratio of new/old voxels and information gain for long-term consistency.  
- Allocate voxels on-the-fly from input depth using sparse octree structure for scalability.

Main Contributions:
- Combines the benefits of voxels and neural implicit networks for scalable and detailed reconstruction.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on pose estimation and surface reconstruction.
- Proposes efficient keyframe selection strategy suitable for maintaining large maps.
- Demonstrates reconstructed maps can enable occlusion handling for AR applications.
- Provides capability for dynamic scene growth and completion in unexplored areas.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hybrid SLAM system Vox-Fusion that combines explicit sparse voxels with implicit neural representations to achieve highly accurate and scalable reconstruction that can benefit AR/VR applications.
