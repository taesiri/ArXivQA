# [AnaloBench: Benchmarking the Identification of Abstract and Long-context   Analogies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Analogical reasoning is an important aspect of human cognition that allows relating concepts and experiences to solve new problems. However, it is unclear if language models (LMs) can perform analogical reasoning well.

- Prior work has mostly studied analogical reasoning in limited contexts such as word analogies. This paper argues that assessing analogical reasoning over more complex scenarios like stories is important.

- Specifically, the paper identifies two key components of human analogical reasoning that need to be assessed in LMs: (1) Ability to recall relevant experiences from a large pool of information (2) Ability to identify analogies between complex, lengthy scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AnaloBench, a new benchmark to assess analogical reasoning abilities of LMs based on two tasks:

    - Task 1: Identify the best analogy from a small pool of story options 
    - Task 2: Identify top analogous stories from a large pool of 200 stories

- The benchmark uses 340 high-quality human-annotated analogous story pairs grouped into 47 clusters. The stories are elaborated to create 1, 10 and 30 sentence versions.

- Both tasks are evaluated on stories of varying lengths to test analogical reasoning over increasing complexity. Ability to recall from large context is also tested.

Key Results:
- Experiments show current LMs struggle with lengthy, complex analogies compared to humans. Performance gap increases for longer stories. 

- Model scaling provides gains for short 1 sentence stories, but has minimal impact on performance for longer 10, 30 sentence stories.

- For large pool of stories, model performance nears random, indicating limitations in recalling and relating experiences.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark to assess key aspects of analogical reasoning in LMs using elaboration of abstract natural language stories
- Thorough analysis of various state-of-the-art models demonstrating limitations in complex, long-context analogical reasoning
- Establishes need for advances in analogical capabilities of LMs to match human cognition

The summary covers the key points about the problem being addressed, the proposed benchmark tasks, main results and contributions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
