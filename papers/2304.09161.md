# [Perspectives on Large Language Models for Relevance Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09161)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seems to address is:

Can large language models (LLMs) be used to automatically generate relevance judgments for information retrieval (IR) evaluation?

The authors explore the feasibility and implications of using LLMs to fully or partially replace human assessors in creating relevance judgments for IR test collections. The key aspects I gathered around this central question are:

- LLMs like ChatGPT claim they can assist with relevance judgments, but it's unclear how well their judgments align with human annotations. 

- The authors propose a "spectrum" of human-LLM collaboration for judgments, from fully manual to fully automated.

- There are various open issues around using LLMs this way, like judgment quality, bias, faithfulness, and circularity.

- They present pilot experiments comparing LLM vs. human judgments on two test collections.

- They outline perspectives for and against using LLMs to replace human relevance judgments.

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that LLMs can generate relevance judgments automatically to some extent, and the paper explores the opportunities and challenges with this idea through literature analysis, proposed collaboration spectrums, experiments, and discussion of perspectives. The overall aim appears to be assessing the feasibility of LLMs replacing or assisting human judgments.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the possibility of using large language models to automatically generate relevance judgments for information retrieval test collections, providing experimental results and perspectives both for and against this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to prior research:

- Methodology: The paper employs a similar experimental approach as previous work, comparing system rankings and relevance judgments produced by LLMs versus human assessors. However, it considers a broader set of test collections and LLMs than prior work.

- Findings: The results align with previous findings showing moderate correlation between LLM and human judgments, but lower sensitivity/discriminative power for LLMs. However, this paper provides a more comprehensive analysis across different tasks.

- Scope: While most prior work has focused narrowly on evaluating LLMs for a specific dataset or task, this paper aims to provide a broader perspective across IR evaluation. The spectrum model is a novel conceptual contribution.

- Application: Rather than proposing the use of LLMs to fully replace human assessors, the authors advocate for adopting a collaborative human-machine approach. The focus is on assisting humans, not replacing them entirely.

- Discussion: The paper provides a balanced discussion of the opportunities and limitations of LLMs for evaluation, outlining different perspectives rather than advocating a single viewpoint.

Overall, this paper builds on the emerging body of research on LLMs for IR evaluation, advancing the discussion through its cross-task analysis, conceptual modeling, balanced perspectives, and emphasis on human-machine collaboration. It helps synthesize prior findings and debates into a unified framework.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating how LLMs can provide explanations for their relevance judgments, which could assist human assessors like crowdworkers. They propose exploring how providing rationales affects the quality of human judgments.

- Determining which sub-tasks of the judgment process still require human input versus what tasks LLMs could fully take over. For example, prompt engineering may still need humans for now.

- Examining if and how LLMs could completely replace humans in the judgment process. Could generative LLMs even create entire new test collections with documents, queries, abstracts, etc.?

- Moving beyond the assumptions of traditional test collections, like static relevance and query independence, if LLMs can reliably perform judgments. More connected, evolving definitions of relevance could be explored.

- Considering if LLMs could surpass human performance on relevance judgments, and how we validate that without human judgments as a gold standard.

- Mitigating risks of using LLMs like bias, faithfulness, and transparency issues. Also ensuring diversity of judgments if using multiple LLMs.

- Developing better human-LLM collaboration for judgments, like verifying or correcting LLM suggestions. Studying the impact of providing LLMs' rationales to assessors.

In summary, key directions are enhancing human-LLM collaboration, determining which tasks remain human-only, and investigating fully automated assessment including risks and benefits. The authors aim to spur discussion on responsible use of LLMs for relevance judgments.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper discusses the potential use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to assist with relevance judgments in information retrieval (IR) tasks. Traditionally, human assessors are needed to make relevance judgments, which is time consuming and costly. The authors propose a spectrum of human-machine collaboration for relevance judgments, ranging from manual human judgments to fully automated judgments by LLMs. They present a preliminary assessment comparing LLM judgments to human judgments on two test collections, finding reasonable correlation but also differences in performance on binary vs. graded judgments. 

Paragraph 2: The authors then provide perspectives for and against using LLMs for automatic relevance judgments. Arguments in favor include the ability of LLMs to provide explanations, improved scalability and consistency, and cost savings. Concerns include that LLMs are not people, so their judgments may not correlate with user needs; potential biases; and risks of using generative models before ethical issues are resolved. Finally, the authors suggest a compromise of double-checking LLM judgments against human judgments and exploring innovative human-LLM collaboration, rather than full automation. Overall, this paper provides a balanced discussion of the opportunities and risks of leveraging LLMs for relevance judgments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents an approach for automatic relevance assessment using large language models (LLMs). The authors conduct a preliminary experiment comparing relevance judgments from LLMs (GPT-3.5 and YouChat) to judgments from human assessors using two test collections - TREC-8 and TREC Deep Learning 2021. They sample topic-document pairs from each collection with different relevance labels based on the human judgments. Tailored prompts are created for each collection and used to obtain binary relevance judgments from the LLMs. The authors analyze agreement between the LLM and human judgments, finding that the LLMs tend to agree more with human judgments on non-relevant documents in TREC-8 but agree more on highly relevant documents in TREC Deep Learning 2021. Overall, the preliminary results suggest potential for LLMs to assist in judging relevance but also gaps compared to human assessors.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points and problems addressed in this paper are:

- Relevance assessment is a critical but costly component of information retrieval (IR) evaluation using the Cranfield paradigm. Human assessors are needed to judge the relevance of documents, which is time-intensive and expensive. 

- The idea of automatically generated relevance judgments has been proposed before but not widely adopted in the IR community. Other approaches like crowdsourcing judgments or only judging text nuggets have emerged to reduce the cost, but still rely heavily on human input.

- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT now claim they can assist with relevance judgments. It is unclear how well their judgments align with human assessors. 

- The main question is whether we are on the verge of being able to delegate relevance judgments to machines using LLMs, either fully or partially, for some or all IR domains/tasks.

- The authors aim to provide a balanced perspective on this contentious idea by presenting consenting and dissenting views. They propose a spectrum of human-LLM collaboration for judgments.

- Key issues explored include the quality of LLM judgments compared to humans, the cost of LLMs, the need for human verification of LLM judgments, bias and faithfulness of LLMs, and opportunities to move beyond current IR evaluation paradigms with increased use of LLMs.

In summary, the central problem is assessing the role LLMs can play in automating the traditionally costly and human-intensive relevance judgment process for IR evaluation. A spectrum of human-LLM collaboration is proposed to frame the discussion.
