# [Perspectives on Large Language Models for Relevance Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09161)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seems to address is:Can large language models (LLMs) be used to automatically generate relevance judgments for information retrieval (IR) evaluation?The authors explore the feasibility and implications of using LLMs to fully or partially replace human assessors in creating relevance judgments for IR test collections. The key aspects I gathered around this central question are:- LLMs like ChatGPT claim they can assist with relevance judgments, but it's unclear how well their judgments align with human annotations. - The authors propose a "spectrum" of human-LLM collaboration for judgments, from fully manual to fully automated.- There are various open issues around using LLMs this way, like judgment quality, bias, faithfulness, and circularity.- They present pilot experiments comparing LLM vs. human judgments on two test collections.- They outline perspectives for and against using LLMs to replace human relevance judgments.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that LLMs can generate relevance judgments automatically to some extent, and the paper explores the opportunities and challenges with this idea through literature analysis, proposed collaboration spectrums, experiments, and discussion of perspectives. The overall aim appears to be assessing the feasibility of LLMs replacing or assisting human judgments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The paper proposes a spectrum of human-machine collaboration for relevance judgments in IR, outlining four levels of collaboration from manual human judgments to fully automated judgments by LLMs. This helps conceptualize and categorize different approaches.2. The paper discusses open issues, risks, and opportunities associated with using LLMs for relevance judgments. Key points include concerns around quality, bias, faithfulness, and full automation. 3. The paper presents pilot experiments comparing LLM judgments to human judgments on two datasets. The results show some correlation but also clear differences, highlighting areas where LLMs need improvement.4. The paper concludes with three perspectives on using LLMs for relevance judgments - in favor, against, and a compromise view. This frames the debate and highlights that more research is needed before fully replacing human judgment.5. Overall, the paper helps advance the discussion around automating relevance judgments using LLMs, while also raising important concerns and considerations for the research community. It provides analysis and evidence to inform future work on human-machine collaboration and evaluation methods for IR.In summary, the spectrum, discussion of issues, initial experiments, and perspectives seem to be the main contributions that help frame this emerging research area. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the summary.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper investigates the possibility of using large language models to automatically generate relevance judgments for information retrieval test collections, providing experimental results and perspectives both for and against this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to prior research:- Methodology: The paper employs a similar experimental approach as previous work, comparing system rankings and relevance judgments produced by LLMs versus human assessors. However, it considers a broader set of test collections and LLMs than prior work.- Findings: The results align with previous findings showing moderate correlation between LLM and human judgments, but lower sensitivity/discriminative power for LLMs. However, this paper provides a more comprehensive analysis across different tasks.- Scope: While most prior work has focused narrowly on evaluating LLMs for a specific dataset or task, this paper aims to provide a broader perspective across IR evaluation. The spectrum model is a novel conceptual contribution.- Application: Rather than proposing the use of LLMs to fully replace human assessors, the authors advocate for adopting a collaborative human-machine approach. The focus is on assisting humans, not replacing them entirely.- Discussion: The paper provides a balanced discussion of the opportunities and limitations of LLMs for evaluation, outlining different perspectives rather than advocating a single viewpoint.Overall, this paper builds on the emerging body of research on LLMs for IR evaluation, advancing the discussion through its cross-task analysis, conceptual modeling, balanced perspectives, and emphasis on human-machine collaboration. It helps synthesize prior findings and debates into a unified framework.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Investigating how LLMs can provide explanations for their relevance judgments, which could assist human assessors like crowdworkers. They propose exploring how providing rationales affects the quality of human judgments.- Determining which sub-tasks of the judgment process still require human input versus what tasks LLMs could fully take over. For example, prompt engineering may still need humans for now.- Examining if and how LLMs could completely replace humans in the judgment process. Could generative LLMs even create entire new test collections with documents, queries, abstracts, etc.?- Moving beyond the assumptions of traditional test collections, like static relevance and query independence, if LLMs can reliably perform judgments. More connected, evolving definitions of relevance could be explored.- Considering if LLMs could surpass human performance on relevance judgments, and how we validate that without human judgments as a gold standard.- Mitigating risks of using LLMs like bias, faithfulness, and transparency issues. Also ensuring diversity of judgments if using multiple LLMs.- Developing better human-LLM collaboration for judgments, like verifying or correcting LLM suggestions. Studying the impact of providing LLMs' rationales to assessors.In summary, key directions are enhancing human-LLM collaboration, determining which tasks remain human-only, and investigating fully automated assessment including risks and benefits. The authors aim to spur discussion on responsible use of LLMs for relevance judgments.
