# [VidToMe: Video Token Merging for Zero-Shot Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion models have shown impressive results for image generation and editing. However, extending them to high-quality video generation remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling complex temporal motions. Existing diffusion-based video editing methods extend image diffusion models by incorporating spatio-temporal self-attention across frames. But they still produce inconsistent results over time and incur heavy memory overhead during training/inference.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes VidToMe, a diffusion-based zero-shot video editing approach via token merging across frames. The key idea is to align and compress self-attention tokens that are redundant across frames to facilitate joint processing and temporal consistency. Specifically:

1) A video is split into chunks of frames for joint editing. Frame tokens are matched based on similarity and merged into a single set of tokens. This sharing of tokens enforces feature consistency across frames.  

2) Local token merging is done within each chunk for short-term consistency. Global token merging shares tokens across all frame chunks  to maintain long-term video coherence.

3) Merged tokens are input to the self-attention module of the diffusion model for joint processing. Output tokens are restored to original sizes via unmerging. The pipeline can integrate existing image editing techniques.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes token merging strategy VidToMe to match and align diffusion model tokens across video frames, improving temporal consistency and computational efficiency.

- Designs a video editing framework with short and long-term token merging to enforce feature alignment across frames in a video.

- Achieves state-of-the-art video editing quality, outperforming previous works in temporal consistency and alignment to text prompts.

The approach enables extending image editing capabilities to coherent video editing via simple yet effective token manipulations, while being compatible with various conditioning methods and base diffusion models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel diffusion-based zero-shot video editing method called VidToMe that improves temporal consistency in generated videos by matching and merging tokens across frames before the self-attention computation in the diffusion model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are three-fold:

1) It proposes a novel diffusion-based approach called VidToMe to merge self-attention tokens across frames when generating video frames. This improves temporal consistency and reduces memory consumption in computing self-attention across frames.

2) It designs a video editing pipeline that jointly generates all video frames with short-term local token merging and long-term global token merging to enforce feature alignment throughout the video. 

3) It comprehensively evaluates the proposed method and shows state-of-the-art video editing performance in terms of temporal consistency and text alignment over existing methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the video token merging strategy (VidToMe) that matches and aligns tokens across frames to improve temporal consistency in the generated videos while also reducing memory overhead. The paper shows both qualitatively and quantitatively that this approach outperforms prior arts in diffusion-based zero-shot video editing.

The paper proposes a novel diffusion-based zero-shot video editing method called VidToMe that merges tokens across video frames to improve temporal consistency. Key aspects include leveraging diffusion models for video generation, merging tokens with a bipartite matching algorithm, enforcing short-term and long-term consistency across video chunks, and attaching the token merging/unmerging operations to the self-attention module. The method aims to enable text-driven video editing while maintaining better video continuity compared to prior arts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes merging tokens across video frames to improve temporal consistency. Why is directly applying image editing methods to video frames insufficient to ensure temporal consistency? What issues arise?

2. Why does extending the self-attention module to process multiple frames jointly, as done in many existing video editing methods, struggle to enforce strict temporal consistency? What are the limitations?

3. Explain the motivation behind proposing a token merging strategy for video editing. How does matching and merging tokens based on temporal correspondence help improve consistency?

4. What are the two components of the proposed video token merging strategy - local token merging and global token merging? Explain their objectives and how they complement each other.  

5. How does the proposed merging of tokens across frames help reduce memory consumption in self-attention computations? Analyze the space complexity with and without token merging.

6. What considerations were made in designing the token merging operations? Explain the choices of using destination tokens as merged values and separating merged tokens after self-attention.  

7. The paper claims the method can integrate seamlessly with existing image editing techniques. Explain how VidToMe is able to build on advancements in image editing for video editing.

8. Discuss the strengths and limitations of using similarity-based token matching for video frames. When might it fail and how can it be improved?

9. Analyze Figure 3 which visualizes matched tokens between frames. How does fixing misalignments in details demonstrate the effect of token merging in enforcing consistency?

10. The quantitative results show higher temporal consistency than baselines. Analyze the metrics used and discuss what factors contribute to VidToMe outperforming other state-of-the-art video editing techniques.
