# [Physics-Informed Neural Network Lyapunov Functions: PDE   Characterization, Learning, and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09131)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper provides a systematic investigation of using physics-informed neural networks to compute Lyapunov functions for stability analysis and estimating regions of attraction of nonlinear systems. It analyzes solutions to Lyapunov and Zubov partial differential equations, which characterize Lyapunov functions and domains of attraction, respectively. Algorithms are presented to train neural networks by encoding these physics-based constraints to obtain neural Lyapunov functions. Sufficient conditions are provided to verify both local exponential stability and regions of attraction estimates using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. Through several numerical examples, including a 20-dimensional system, the paper demonstrates that solving the Zubov equation with neural networks and verifying the obtained Lyapunov functions can provide tighter estimations of the region of attraction compared to standard sums-of-squares techniques. This is achieved by leveraging the representational power and non-convex optimization of neural networks, along with formal verification tools, to excel where convex optimization approaches may fail.
