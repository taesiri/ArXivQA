# [Improved Image Generation via Sparse Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00464)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be whether enforcing sparsity in the intermediate representations of image generators can lead to improved image synthesis and inverse problem solving. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that existing convolutional image generators like those used in GANs and Deep Image Prior can be interpreted as relying on sparse modeling, in the form of Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) and its multi-layer version (ML-CSC). By making this connection explicit and inducing sparsity in the intermediate activations of these generators, the authors propose that performance can be improved.To test this hypothesis, the authors do the following:- Propose a novel interpretation of image generators as implicitly performing CSC/ML-CSC synthesis. They split the generator into a part that maps noise to a sparse code (G^S) and a part that multiplies this code by a dictionary to synthesize the image (G^I).- Apply various sparsity-inducing regularizations (L0, L1, L0-infinity norms) to the intermediate activations of generators during training.- Demonstrate improved image synthesis on various GAN architectures when trained with these sparsity regularizations.- Show similar performance gains when applying the regularizations to image generators used in Deep Image Prior for solving inverse problems like denoising.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging sparse modeling interpretations and inducing sparsity can lead to better performance in image generators used for synthesis and inverse problems. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis across different generator architectures.
