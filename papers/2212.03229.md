# [Rethinking Video ViTs: Sparse Video Tubes for Joint Image and Video   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03229)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called TubeViT that aims to enable Vision Transformer (ViT) models to efficiently handle both image and video inputs. The key ideas are:

- Using sparse video tubes to generate tokens from videos instead of dense sampling. This reduces the number of tokens and computational cost compared to prior video ViT methods. 

- Sharing weights between the image and video pathways, rather than having separate specialized networks. This allows joint training and transfer learning between images and videos.

- Using fixed positional embeddings based on tube coordinates rather than learned embeddings. This better represents the global spatio-temporal location of the sparse tubes.

- Scaling up models by adapting pretrained image ViTs using the sparse tube approach, avoiding expensive full finetuning.

The main hypothesis is that these techniques will allow ViT models to work well on both images and videos in an efficient and unified manner, outperforming prior specialized video ViT models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis across several video datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple and effective method called TubeViT to enable standard Vision Transformer (ViT) models to work seamlessly with both image and video inputs. The key ideas are:

- Introducing Sparse Video Tubes, obtained by sparsely sampling the input video with 3D convolutional kernels of different shapes and strides. This allows creating a small set of tokens to represent the video, keeping the overall number of tokens low. 

- The sparse sampling means the model can easily handle either images or videos as input using the same parameters and backbone network.

- The sparse video tubes capture both spatial and temporal information from videos, while keeping compute costs manageable.

- The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple video classification benchmarks including Kinetics, Something-Something and Charades, outperforming previous specialized video architectures.

- The approach enables easy joint training on image and video datasets, which improves performance on both compared to training them separately. 

- It provides an efficient way to scale up ViT models for video by adapting large image-pretrained models using the sparse tubes, without needing full fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing Sparse Video Tubes to enable standard ViTs to work seamlessly and efficiently on both images and videos, outperforming prior specialized video models while being simple and easy to implement. The sparse sampling is critical to efficiently handle videos with transformers while allowing joint training on multiple modalities.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other video understanding research:

- The paper proposes a new technique called "Sparse Video Tubes" to enable Vision Transformers (ViTs) to handle both image and video inputs. This contrasts with many previous works that have developed specialized video architectures like 3D CNNs or spatio-temporal transformers. The Sparse Video Tubes allow a standard ViT to work on videos without major modifications.

- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on major video datasets like Kinetics-400/600/700 and Something-Something V2. It outperforms prior works that use techniques like inflating 2D kernels to 3D, adding temporal specific layers, or using dense space-time sampling. This shows the Sparse Video Tubes are an efficient and effective approach. 

- The model is able to jointly leverage both image and video data seamlessly during training. This allows it to utilize diverse datasets and improves performance over models trained on either images or videos alone. Many prior works have separate image and video models or complex co-training procedures.

- The approach enables easy scaling up of models by adapting pretrained image ViTs with lightweight fine-tuning. This is more efficient than full video pretraining and matches or exceeds specialized video pretraining methods.

- The sparse sampling is shown to be important for performance and efficiency. Too many tokens degraded results, especially when training only on video data. This indicates current datasets may not support very long sequences and sparse sampling is a better strategy.

Overall, the paper shows competitive results can be achieved with a simple and unified architecture for both images and videos. The Sparse Video Tubes seem to be an effective technique for adapting vision transformers to video in an efficient and scalable manner.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

- Applying the sparse video tubes approach to other vision transformer architectures. The current work focuses on standard ViT models, but the sparse tubes could likely improve other ViT variants as well.

- Training larger models with sparse video tubes. The paper demonstrates a method to efficiently scale up models by adapting sparse tubes to larger image-pretrained ViTs. Further exploration of training bigger models this way is suggested.

- Pre-training with masked prediction tasks. Recent video MAE works have shown benefits of pre-training with masking and prediction. Combining sparse tubes with masked prediction pre-training could further improve video understanding.

- Testing on a wider range of video datasets. The paper focuses on action recognition datasets like Kinetics and Charades. Evaluating on other types of video tasks could reveal further benefits or limitations.

- Studying the effects of sparse tubes on different modalities. The current work is on RGB videos, but looking at sparse tubes for other inputs like optical flow could be interesting.

- Leveraging sparse tubes for video generation tasks. The paper focuses on recognition, but modeling videos with sparse tubes could be useful for generation as well.

In summary, the authors propose future work on optimizing the tube designs, scaling to larger models, combining with other pre-training methods, evaluating on more tasks and data, and extending to other modalities and applications. Overall, there seem to be many promising research avenues building on this idea of sparse video tubes for transformers.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a simple yet effective approach called TubeViT that transforms a standard vision transformer (ViT) into an efficient model for both image and video inputs. The key idea is to sparsely sample the video using 3D spatio-temporal tubes of varying shapes and sizes. These sparse video tubes are used to generate learnable tokens that are input to the ViT backbone. Specifically, the approach combines the following elements:

- Sparse sampling of the video using a few 3D convolutional kernels with large strides to generate video tokens. This is in contrast to dense sampling used in prior video ViTs.

- Multiple tubes with different spatio-temporal size are used (e.g. a large temporal and small spatial tube) to capture information at different resolutions.

- The tubes are concatenated with regular 2D image patches also sampled from the video frames to form the full set of tokens for the ViT. 

- Fixed sinusoidal position embeddings are used that encode the global spatio-temporal location of each tube token based on the tube's shape, stride and offset.

- The same ViT backbone seamlessly works on image-only, video-only or joint image and video data without modifications.

In summary, TubeViT uses sparse video tubes for tokenization to enable a single compact ViT model to handle both images and videos efficiently. This joint training also improves accuracy on both tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of adapting Vision Transformer (ViT) models to handle video inputs efficiently. Specifically, it aims to develop a video ViT model that can work with both image and video inputs seamlessly. 

The key issues the paper tries to address are:

- Existing video ViT models like TimeSformer and ViViT use dense spatio-temporal sampling, which results in a large number of tokens and makes them computationally expensive. 

- Most prior video models are specialized only for videos and not easily applicable to images. Having a universal visual backbone that can handle both images and videos is desirable.

- Training large-scale video ViT models is very expensive. The paper explores ways to leverage image-only pretrained ViTs to create powerful video models without full finetuning.

- Jointly training on image and video datasets is beneficial but not well explored. Prior methods either train them separately or require customized architectures.

To summarize, the paper introduces an approach to adapt ViTs to video efficiently while retaining their universality for both images and videos. It also enables leveraging large image-only ViTs for video understanding with minimal finetuning.
