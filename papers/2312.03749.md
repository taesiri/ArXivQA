# [Conceptual Engineering Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03749)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conceptual engineering (CE) aims to assess and improve concepts, but lacks empirical, data-driven methods to evaluate different concept definitions.
- Knowledge graphs like Wikidata impact society but may lack alignment between concept definitions and representation of concept extensions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Implements classification procedures from Nado's CE theory using large language models (LLMs). 
- Applies LLMs to generate rationales that classify entities as instances or non-instances of a concept based on its definition.  
- Evaluates concept definitions by sampling instances from Wikidata, having the LLM classify them, and computing performance metrics.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a method to empirically evaluate different definitions of a concept by applying them as computational classification procedures.
- Shows this method can identify issues with concept definitions and areas for improvement.
- Discusses using this to improve alignment of definitions and representations in knowledge graphs. 
- Proposes LLMs could support philosophers conducting CE projects.
- Views this as an initial step in investigating utility of LLMs for conceptual engineering.

In summary, the paper puts forward an empirical, LLM-based approach to implementing and evaluating conceptual engineering targets, demonstrating its potential to assist philosophers in conceptual analysis while also improving alignment of definitions and representations in knowledge graphs.
