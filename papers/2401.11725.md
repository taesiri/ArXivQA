# [Speak It Out: Solving Symbol-Related Problems with Symbol-to-Language   Conversion for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11725)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Speak It Out: Solving Symbol-Related Problems with Symbol-to-Language Conversion for Language Models":

Problem:
- Symbols (e.g. numbers, brackets, formulas) are ubiquitous and important for tasks like abstract reasoning, chemical prediction, QA, etc. 
- However, large language models (LLMs) have limited capabilities in understanding and reasoning about symbols compared to natural language. This is due to the underrepresentation of symbols in training data and the difficulty for LLMs to process symbol-based representations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a simple yet effective method called "symbol-to-language" (S2L) to address symbol-related problems using LLMs. 
- The key idea is to convert symbols into natural language descriptions that are more friendly for LLMs to understand and reason about. This conversion can be done by prompting the LLMs or using external tools like translators and dictionaries.

- After getting the language-based representations of symbols, S2L incorporates them into the original symbol-related problems in two ways:
  (1) Direct substitution: Replace the original symbols with language-based equivalents 
  (2) Concatenation: Append language-based descriptions to the original symbol representations

- By integrating comprehensive language-based information, S2L aims to better elicit LLMs' reasoning capability to solve problems involving symbols.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed the intuitive yet effective S2L method to handle symbol-related problems using LLMs without any parameter tuning
- Validated S2L on multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, OpenChat) over diverse tasks with symbols 
- Experiments showed S2L leads to significant performance improvements averaging from +9.5% to +21.9% absolutely across symbol-intensive tasks
- Analyzed pros of providing precise, co-occurrence, alignment information in language, and limitations of S2L
- Showcased the potential of leveraging language-based representations to expand the applicability of LLMs on broader problems involving symbols


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes symbol-to-language, a method that converts symbolic representations into natural language to improve the performance of large language models on symbol-related reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a symbol-to-language (S2L) method that converts symbol-based representations to language-based representations in order to better solve symbol-related problems using large language models. Specifically:

- S2L converts symbols (e.g. numerical sequences, brackets, molecular formulas) into corresponding natural language expressions either by prompting the language models themselves or using external tools. 

- The converted language-based representations are then integrated into the original symbol-based problems via direct substitution or concatenation. This provides the language models with more understandable and contextualized information to reason about and solve the problems.

- Experiments were conducted on diverse tasks involving different types of symbols, including abstract reasoning, Dyck language, chemical property prediction, emoji analysis, table question answering, stance detection, and sentiment analysis. Results show that S2L leads to significant performance improvements across models and tasks compared to conventional zero-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a simple yet effective symbol-to-language approach to elicit the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of language models on tasks involving symbols by providing the models with more language-based contextual information.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the symbol-to-language method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions both converting symbols to language with LLMs and using external tools. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach? When would you choose one over the other?

2. The paper evaluates performance on a diverse set of 8 tasks. Which task or tasks posed the biggest challenges for the proposed method and why? Where does the method still fall short?  

3. The method uses two alternative ways to incorporate the language-based representations into the final input - direct substitution or concatenation. What factors determine which approach is more suitable for a given task? How could the choices be further optimized?

4. What types of symbols or tasks would be most difficult to convert into natural language representations? What are the limitations of the approach in these cases? How could the method be extended to broader contexts?

5. The method does not require any specialized tuning and works directly with pre-trained LLMs. Does this introduce any downsides compared to fine-tuning approaches? Could performance be further improved with tuning?   

6. How robust is the performance of the method to variations in the specific prompts used for symbol-to-language conversion? How could prompt engineering be optimized for different tasks?

7. The paper hypothesizes that providing language-based representations helps ground LLMs better compared to symbolic inputs. Is there any way to test whether this hypothesis holds, both quantitatively and qualitatively?  

8. Could the idea of symbol-to-language conversion be integrated with other techniques like chain-of-thought prompting to achieve further gains? What would be the best way to combine these approaches?

9. The method relies on the availability of high-quality pre-trained LLMs. How critical is model scale and capability to successfully utilizing language-based conversions? Where are the minimum capability thresholds?

10. The paper focuses on solving problems with a symbolic component. Are there other settings beyond those tested where converting representations could prove beneficial when using LLMs? What new use cases could be explored?
