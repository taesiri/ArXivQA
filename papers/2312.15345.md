# [RoboFiSense: Attention-Based Robotic Arm Activity Recognition with WiFi   Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robot activity recognition in indoor environments is challenging for traditional vision and LiDAR sensors due to line-of-sight limitations and privacy concerns. 
- Variations in velocity during robotic motions also pose difficulties.
- Choosing optimal WiFi sniffer locations to collect reliable channel state information (CSI) data is an open question. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a bidirectional vision transformer concatenated (BiVTC) model to classify robotic arm activities using CSI data from WiFi signals.
- They systematically vary robotic motion velocities during data collection to improve robustness.  
- They study the impact of sniffer locations on a 3x3 grid area.

Contributions:
- Introduce BiVTC model combining two vision transformers to extract hierarchical features from multi-sniffer CSI data.
- Show BiVTC accurately classifies 8 distinct Franka arm activities even with varying velocities.
- Demonstrate adding velocity diversity is an effective regularization technique.
- Find sniffer locations closer to the robot provide higher quality CSI data. 
- Release RoboFiSense benchmark dataset with 8 robotic arm activities performed at 3 velocities.

In summary, this paper pioneers WiFi sensing for robotic arm activity recognition, proposes a novel BiVTC methodology robust to velocity changes, provides insights on sniffer placement, and shares the RoboFiSense dataset to spur research progress.
