# [Private Fine-tuning of Large Language Models with Zeroth-order   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pretrained language models (LLMs) on private datasets raises privacy concerns and risks for individuals in the training data. 
- Differential privacy (DP) is a framework that provides strong privacy guarantees by enforcing algorithmic stability, but applying DP-SGD for private fine-tuning introduces significant engineering challenges and often hurts model performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new method called DP-ZO that leverages zeroth-order optimization to privatize the fine-tuning process. 
- Key idea is that the gradient direction in zeroth-order methods like SPSA is random, so only the scalar step size needs to be privatized by adding noise. This avoids per-example gradient computations.
- DP-ZO clips the step size and adds Gaussian or Laplace noise to it to satisfy DP. Easy to implement with just a few lines of code.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the first differentially private fine-tuning method based on zeroth-order optimization. Avoids engineering complexity of DP-SGD.
- Scales to very large models like OPT-66B by only privatizing a scalar. DP-SGD struggles to scale due to computational constraints.
- Provides strong privacy-utility tradeoff. For OPT-66B on SQuAD with 1000 training examples, only 1.86% drop in F1 score at (ε=1,δ=10^-5)-DP.
- First method to achieve non-trivial utility under pure ε-DP by using the Laplace mechanism. OP-66B gets 73.69% F1 on SQuAD at ε=10.
- Analyzes performance in low-data regime. More data significantly improves private but not non-private performance.
- Extensive experiments validating DP-ZO across models, tasks, batch sizes and DP mechanisms.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel and scalable method for private fine-tuning of large language models with differential privacy guarantees. The method provides an excellent privacy-utility tradeoff and avoids major engineering challenges faced in applying DP-SGD.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called DP-ZO for differentially private fine-tuning of large language models that privatizes the zeroth-order optimization update by adding noise to the difference in loss between perturbations, achieving strong utility with low overhead compared to prior differential privacy methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called DP-ZO for differentially private fine-tuning of large language models. The key ideas and contributions are:

1) DP-ZO uses zeroth-order optimization to estimate gradients based on the difference in losses between two random perturbations. This allows privatization by just adding noise to the scalar loss difference instead of clipping and adding noise to each parameter's gradient as in DP-SGD.

2) DP-ZO can scale to very large models like OPT-66B easily since it doesn't compute or store gradients. It is also communication-efficient for parallel training.

3) DP-ZO provides strong empirical results on SQuAD, DROP and SST-2 datasets. One highlight is only 1.86% performance drop at (ε=1, δ=10^−5) when fine-tuning OPT-66B on SQuAD with 1000 training examples.

4) DP-ZO with Laplace noise gives the first method with non-trivial accuracy under pure ε-DP for private language model fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DP-ZO as an effective and scalable method for differentially private fine-tuning of large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Differential privacy (DP) - The paper focuses on training machine learning models with differential privacy guarantees. This is the core privacy notion explored.

- Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) - Instead of using gradients, the proposed DP-ZO method uses random perturbations and differences in loss to update models. This is a form of zeroth-order optimization.

- Fine-tuning - The paper looks at fine-tuning large pretrained language models like OPT and LLMs with differential privacy.

- Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms - These are specific differential privacy mechanisms that can be used with DP-ZO to privatize the loss differences. 

- Pure ε-DP vs (ε,δ)-DP - The paper analyzes both pure differential privacy without failure probability, and approximate DP. DP-ZO with Laplace noise provides pure DP.

- Privacy budget - The paper evaluates DP-ZO under different privacy budgets ε, which measures the privacy loss. Smaller ε indicates stronger privacy.

- Few-shot learning - Unlike some prior work, experiments are done in a challenging few-shot setting with only 1000 training examples.

- Strong scaling - The paper shows DP-ZO can scale to fine-tune large 175B parameter models compared to DP-SGD.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the differentially private zeroth-order optimization method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that DP-ZO is compatible with mixed precision training and GPU parallelism, enabling scaling to larger models like OPT-66B. Can you expand more on the specifics of how mixed precision training and GPU parallelism were implemented with DP-ZO? Were any modifications required compared to standard implementations?

2. In the privacy analysis, you use composition theorems to analyze iterative application of DP-ZO. Did you also explore using Rényi differential privacy and moments accountant to try getting tighter privacy guarantees? Could this allow providing better epsilon values?

3. You showed DP-ZO works for natural language tasks like SQuAD and SST-2. How do you envision DP-ZO would perform for computer vision tasks compared to DP-SGD? Would the privacy-utility tradeoffs be similar or would differences arise?  

4. The paper mentions DP-ZO is storage and communication efficient compared to transmitting model parameter differences in DP-SGD. Can you expand more quantitatively on the exact storage and communication savings seen with the DP-ZO approach of transmitting seeds and step sizes?

5. You explored DP-ZO with Gaussian and Laplace noise but mentioned it is compatible with other DP mechanisms. What other mechanisms did you consider (e.g. uniform noise) and why were they not as effective? Are there other promising directions to explore here?

6. When varying the number of training samples n, you saw bigger improvements in private performance compared to non-private. What hypotheses do you have for why additional data helps more for the private case? 

7. For what range of epsilon and delta values was DP-ZO most effective compared to DP-SGD? As privacy budgets become smaller, when does DP-ZO start to degrade compared to DP-SGD?

8. The paper mentions DP-ZO does not require storing activations or gradients. Can you expand more on the memory savings this enables compared to DP-SGD for larger models? Quantitatively how much memory overhead was avoided?

9. You explored DP-ZO by updating a sparse subset of parameters in LoRA. How do you think DP-ZO would perform with other parameter efficient tuning approaches like prefix tuning or bit tuning?

10. When evaluated on pure epsilon-DP with the Laplace mechanism, what main challenges arise compared to approximate (epsilon, delta)-DP? How can those challenges be addressed to make pure DP more practical with DP-ZO?
