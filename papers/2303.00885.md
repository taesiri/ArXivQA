# [Towards Trustable Skin Cancer Diagnosis via Rewriting Model's Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the trustworthiness and robustness of skin cancer diagnosis models by discovering and removing confounding factors that the models may rely on, through a human-in-the-loop approach?The key points are:- Deep learning models for skin cancer diagnosis can rely on confounding factors like image artifacts or bias rather than clinically relevant features, making their decisions untrustworthy. - The authors propose a framework to make models more explainable via concept mapping, allow human users to identify confounding behaviors, and enable interaction to correct the model's logic.- They introduce a new dataset called ConfDerm to systematically evaluate model trustworthiness under controlled confounding factors.- Experiments show their method can effectively detect and mitigate confounding factors without prior knowledge about the data, improving model performance on clinically-relevant concepts.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that involving humans in the loop to identify and correct confounding model behaviors can improve the trustworthiness and robustness of skin cancer diagnosis systems. The ConfDerm dataset and experiments are designed to validate this hypothesis.
