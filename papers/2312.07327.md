# [Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Hashing for Multimedia Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07327)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Hashing (ACMVH) method for effective multimedia retrieval. ACMVH introduces adaptive confidence learning to credibly fuse features from multiple views and suppress redundant noise. It first utilizes confidence networks to extract useful single-view features and remove noise. Then, an adaptive confidence multi-view network measures the confidence of each view and fuses the multi-view features through a weighted summation. Furthermore, a dilation network is applied on the fused features to enhance the representation. Extensive experiments on MIR-Flickr25K and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that ACMVH achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to a 3.24% increase in mean average precision over previous methods. The core innovations are the introduction of confidence learning for multimedia retrieval and the adaptive confidence-based multi-view fusion, which together credibly integrate complementary information from multiple views to learn superior hash codes.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current multi-view hashing methods for multimedia retrieval suffer from untrustworthy fusion of multi-view features. This is mainly due to two reasons:
    1) Single-view features contain redundant noise which gets aggregated during fusion. 
    2) Lack of confidence measurement of individual views and their importance before fusing them through simple summation.
    
Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Hashing (ACMVH) method to address the above issues. 

- The key components of ACMVH are:
    1) Confidence Network: Extracts useful single-view features and suppresses noise
    2) Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Network: Automatically learns confidence of each view and fuses them using weighted summation
    3) Dilation Network: Enhances the semantic representation of the fused features

Main Contributions:
- First application of confidence learning in multi-view multimedia retrieval
- Outperforms state-of-the-art with average mAP improvement of 2.12% and 2.05% on MIR-Flickr25K and NUS-WIDE datasets
- Ablation studies validate the efficiency of the confidence network, adaptive fusion and dilation network components

In summary, the paper proposes a novel deep hashing framework ACMVH that credibly fuses multi-view features through adaptive confidence learning. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for multimedia retrieval. The main novelty lies in introducing confidence modeling to eliminate noise and weight the importance of individual views before fusing them.
