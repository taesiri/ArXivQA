 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Hashing (ACMVH) method for effective multimedia retrieval. ACMVH introduces adaptive confidence learning to credibly fuse features from multiple views and suppress redundant noise. It first utilizes confidence networks to extract useful single-view features and remove noise. Then, an adaptive confidence multi-view network measures the confidence of each view and fuses the multi-view features through a weighted summation. Furthermore, a dilation network is applied on the fused features to enhance the representation. Extensive experiments on MIR-Flickr25K and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that ACMVH achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to a 3.24% increase in mean average precision over previous methods. The core innovations are the introduction of confidence learning for multimedia retrieval and the adaptive confidence-based multi-view fusion, which together credibly integrate complementary information from multiple views to learn superior hash codes.
