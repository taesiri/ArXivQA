# [Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Hashing for Multimedia Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current multi-view hashing methods for multimedia retrieval suffer from untrustworthy fusion of multi-view features. This is mainly due to two reasons:
    1) Single-view features contain redundant noise which gets aggregated during fusion. 
    2) Lack of confidence measurement of individual views and their importance before fusing them through simple summation.
    
Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Hashing (ACMVH) method to address the above issues. 

- The key components of ACMVH are:
    1) Confidence Network: Extracts useful single-view features and suppresses noise
    2) Adaptive Confidence Multi-View Network: Automatically learns confidence of each view and fuses them using weighted summation
    3) Dilation Network: Enhances the semantic representation of the fused features

Main Contributions:
- First application of confidence learning in multi-view multimedia retrieval
- Outperforms state-of-the-art with average mAP improvement of 2.12% and 2.05% on MIR-Flickr25K and NUS-WIDE datasets
- Ablation studies validate the efficiency of the confidence network, adaptive fusion and dilation network components

In summary, the paper proposes a novel deep hashing framework ACMVH that credibly fuses multi-view features through adaptive confidence learning. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for multimedia retrieval. The main novelty lies in introducing confidence modeling to eliminate noise and weight the importance of individual views before fusing them.
