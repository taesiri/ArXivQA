# [Alljoined -- A dataset for EEG-to-Image decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior EEG-to-image datasets have limitations in acquisition design, limited diversity of visual stimuli, or few participants, restricting image reconstruction efforts. 
- Longer stimulus presentation times and intervals between stimuli are needed to capture the full breadth of visual information processing in the brain across both lower and higher level mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce Alljoined1, a large-scale EEG dataset of neural responses to visual stimuli, aimed to enable robust and generalizable EEG-based image reconstruction.  
- The dataset contains brain activity recordings from 8 participants viewing 10,000 natural images each, with a total of 46,080 image presentation epochs captured by a 64-channel EEG headset.

Key Aspects:
- Uses a stimulus onset asynchrony of 300ms image presentation followed by 300ms rest interval to capture both early and later stage visual processing.
- Stimuli comprise a diverse set of images labeled with 80 MS-COCO categories, avoiding single-class bias. 
- Images are repeated across blocks and sessions to improve signal-to-noise ratio.
- Provides complete pre-processing details and analysis of ERP waveforms, topographies, and signal quality.

Main Contributions:
- Largest and most diverse EEG dataset for image reconstruction with neural responses to 90,000 natural images.
- Optimized stimulus timing parameters to capture full breadth of visual processing based on analysis. 
- Eight human participants mitigates single-subject bias and improves generalizability.
- Detailed documentation and analyses characterizing signals establish benchmark for EEG-based approaches.

The paper introduces an extensive, high-quality EEG dataset tailored to drive advancements in EEG-based image reconstruction to understand visual neural encodings.
