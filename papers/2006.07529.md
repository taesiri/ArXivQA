# [Rethinking the Value of Labels for Improving Class-Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07529)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to maximally exploit the value of labels to improve class-imbalanced learning?The key points are:- The paper identifies a dilemma regarding the value of labels in imbalanced learning: labels are valuable for supervision, but can also introduce bias due to class imbalance. - The paper proposes to systematically analyze the two facets of this dilemma - the positive and negative viewpoints of label value.- Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates both viewpoints are valid and useful:1) Positively, labels are valuable and can be used with extra unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner to reduce label bias and improve performance. 2) Negatively, labels introduce bias so pre-training in a self-supervised manner without using labels leads to better performance.- By exploiting both the positive and negative facets, the proposed semi-supervised and self-supervised strategies achieve new state-of-the-art results on large-scale imbalanced datasets.In summary, the central question is how to best exploit imbalanced labels to improve learning, which is addressed by decomposing and validating the two viewpoints of the value of such labels. The key contribution is demonstrating both viewpoints are significant through principled semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques.
