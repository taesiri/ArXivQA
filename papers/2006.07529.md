# [Rethinking the Value of Labels for Improving Class-Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07529)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to maximally exploit the value of labels to improve class-imbalanced learning?The key points are:- The paper identifies a dilemma regarding the value of labels in imbalanced learning: labels are valuable for supervision, but can also introduce bias due to class imbalance. - The paper proposes to systematically analyze the two facets of this dilemma - the positive and negative viewpoints of label value.- Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates both viewpoints are valid and useful:1) Positively, labels are valuable and can be used with extra unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner to reduce label bias and improve performance. 2) Negatively, labels introduce bias so pre-training in a self-supervised manner without using labels leads to better performance.- By exploiting both the positive and negative facets, the proposed semi-supervised and self-supervised strategies achieve new state-of-the-art results on large-scale imbalanced datasets.In summary, the central question is how to best exploit imbalanced labels to improve learning, which is addressed by decomposing and validating the two viewpoints of the value of such labels. The key contribution is demonstrating both viewpoints are significant through principled semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents two strategies for improving deep learning with class-imbalanced data. The key contributions are:1. It systematically analyzes the value of labels in imbalanced learning through two perspectives: - Positively, imbalanced labels are valuable and can be leveraged with extra unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner to reduce label bias. This is demonstrated theoretically and empirically.- Negatively, imbalanced labels introduce bias and are not always useful. Self-supervised pre-training without using labels is shown both theoretically and empirically to benefit imbalanced learning.2. It proposes semi-supervised and self-supervised frameworks tailored for imbalanced learning and shows they can substantially improve existing techniques.3. Through extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks, it provides new state-of-the-art results by exploiting the two facets of imbalanced labels. In summary, the main contribution is providing a systematic study on the value of labels in imbalanced learning, revealing that both the positive and negative perspectives are promising. This highlights the need to rethink the usage of biased labels to advance class-imbalanced learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper systematically analyzes imbalanced learning through two viewpoints on imbalanced labels, validating and exploiting the value of labels in new semi-supervised and self-supervised ways which substantially improve the state-of-the-art in class-imbalanced learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several valuable contributions to the field of class-imbalanced learning:1. It provides a new perspective on the value of labels in imbalanced learning. Previous work has typically focused on either using labels directly or trying to overcome label bias, but this paper systematically analyzes both the positive and negative aspects of imbalanced labels.2. It proposes novel semi-supervised and self-supervised learning frameworks tailored for imbalanced data. The semi-supervised approach leverages extra unlabeled data to reduce label bias, while the self-supervised approach pre-trains on imbalanced data without using labels initially. Both are grounded in theoretical analysis.3. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The semi-supervised approach sets new state-of-the-art results by successfully exploiting unlabeled data. The self-supervised approach also substantially improves over previous methods by overcoming label bias through pre-training.4. The paper provides new insights into when and how imbalanced labels are valuable, and highlights the need to rethink their usage depending on the application. For example, the limitations of semi-supervised learning are discussed if unlabeled data exhibits similar imbalance as the training set.Overall, this paper makes important theoretical and empirical contributions to improving deep learning under class imbalance. The dual perspective on label value and the semi-supervised/self-supervised frameworks are novel to this field. The strong experimental results also validate the efficacy of the proposed techniques and analysis. This helps advance the state-of-the-art in handling real-world imbalanced distributions.
