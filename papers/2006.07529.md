# [Rethinking the Value of Labels for Improving Class-Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07529)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to maximally exploit the value of labels to improve class-imbalanced learning?The key points are:- The paper identifies a dilemma regarding the value of labels in imbalanced learning: labels are valuable for supervision, but can also introduce bias due to class imbalance. - The paper proposes to systematically analyze the two facets of this dilemma - the positive and negative viewpoints of label value.- Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates both viewpoints are valid and useful:1) Positively, labels are valuable and can be used with extra unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner to reduce label bias and improve performance. 2) Negatively, labels introduce bias so pre-training in a self-supervised manner without using labels leads to better performance.- By exploiting both the positive and negative facets, the proposed semi-supervised and self-supervised strategies achieve new state-of-the-art results on large-scale imbalanced datasets.In summary, the central question is how to best exploit imbalanced labels to improve learning, which is addressed by decomposing and validating the two viewpoints of the value of such labels. The key contribution is demonstrating both viewpoints are significant through principled semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents two strategies for improving deep learning with class-imbalanced data. The key contributions are:1. It systematically analyzes the value of labels in imbalanced learning through two perspectives: - Positively, imbalanced labels are valuable and can be leveraged with extra unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner to reduce label bias. This is demonstrated theoretically and empirically.- Negatively, imbalanced labels introduce bias and are not always useful. Self-supervised pre-training without using labels is shown both theoretically and empirically to benefit imbalanced learning.2. It proposes semi-supervised and self-supervised frameworks tailored for imbalanced learning and shows they can substantially improve existing techniques.3. Through extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks, it provides new state-of-the-art results by exploiting the two facets of imbalanced labels. In summary, the main contribution is providing a systematic study on the value of labels in imbalanced learning, revealing that both the positive and negative perspectives are promising. This highlights the need to rethink the usage of biased labels to advance class-imbalanced learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper systematically analyzes imbalanced learning through two viewpoints on imbalanced labels, validating and exploiting the value of labels in new semi-supervised and self-supervised ways which substantially improve the state-of-the-art in class-imbalanced learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several valuable contributions to the field of class-imbalanced learning:1. It provides a new perspective on the value of labels in imbalanced learning. Previous work has typically focused on either using labels directly or trying to overcome label bias, but this paper systematically analyzes both the positive and negative aspects of imbalanced labels.2. It proposes novel semi-supervised and self-supervised learning frameworks tailored for imbalanced data. The semi-supervised approach leverages extra unlabeled data to reduce label bias, while the self-supervised approach pre-trains on imbalanced data without using labels initially. Both are grounded in theoretical analysis.3. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The semi-supervised approach sets new state-of-the-art results by successfully exploiting unlabeled data. The self-supervised approach also substantially improves over previous methods by overcoming label bias through pre-training.4. The paper provides new insights into when and how imbalanced labels are valuable, and highlights the need to rethink their usage depending on the application. For example, the limitations of semi-supervised learning are discussed if unlabeled data exhibits similar imbalance as the training set.Overall, this paper makes important theoretical and empirical contributions to improving deep learning under class imbalance. The dual perspective on label value and the semi-supervised/self-supervised frameworks are novel to this field. The strong experimental results also validate the efficacy of the proposed techniques and analysis. This helps advance the state-of-the-art in handling real-world imbalanced distributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing new semi-supervised learning methods tailored for class-imbalanced data. The authors show that existing semi-supervised techniques like VAT and Mean Teacher can benefit imbalanced learning, but designing methods specifically for handling imbalance could lead to further improvements.- Exploring different self-supervised pre-training techniques and objectives for imbalanced learning tasks. The authors demonstrate the benefit of using existing self-supervised methods like Rotation and MoCo, but propose investigating new pretext tasks or contrastive objectives suited for long-tailed data distributions.- Combining semi-supervised and self-supervised strategies. The paper shows the promise of both unlabeled data and self-supervision independently. Developing methods to leverage them jointly could provide complementary benefits.- Theoretical analysis on how class imbalance affects representation learning and decision boundaries. The authors provide some initial theoretical results, but more in-depth analysis could further elucidate the issues caused by imbalanced labels.- Evaluating proposed techniques on more real-world imbalanced datasets. The methods are tested on academic benchmarks, but validating on highly skewed real applications like medical diagnosis could be insightful.- Mitigating negative societal impacts of imbalanced models like unfairness or bias issues. The authors focus on standard accuracy, but ensuring fairness and avoiding harm on minority groups is critical.- Extending techniques to other recognition tasks like detection, segmentation, etc. The current work is on image classification, but many other vision problems exhibit class imbalance as well.In summary, the paper opens up several exciting directions on rethinking imbalanced learning, through semi-supervised or self-supervised paradigms, novel objectives and algorithms, theoretical understandings, and real-world evaluations. There remain many open problems to address on effectively handling class imbalance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper examines the dilemma on the value of labels in class-imbalanced learning, where labels are both beneficial for supervision but also introduce bias from the imbalanced distribution. The authors propose two methods to handle the positive and negative facets of labels. First, they show theoretically and empirically that imbalanced labels are valuable with unlabeled data. Leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner via pseudo-labeling reduces the label bias and improves classifiers. Second, they demonstrate imbalanced labels introduce bias. Theoretical analysis and experiments show pre-training classifiers in a self-supervised manner before using the biased labels consistently improves performance by learning more generalized representations. The semi-supervised and self-supervised strategies are shown to advance state-of-the-art on large-scale imbalanced benchmarks. The results highlight the need to rethink how to best exploit imbalanced labels and provide principled techniques through both viewpoints of the label dilemma.
