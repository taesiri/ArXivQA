# [Priority-Centric Human Motion Generation in Discrete Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14480)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality, diverse 3D human motions that align well with complex natural language descriptions, by utilizing discrete representations and diffusion models?The key points are:- The paper proposes a novel approach for text-to-motion generation using discrete representations and diffusion models. - Current methods struggle with complex textual descriptions, often generating motions that don't fully capture the semantics. - The paper introduces a priority-centric motion discrete diffusion model (M2DM) to address this.- M2DM employs a Transformer VQ-VAE to learn a concise, discrete motion representation. - It uses an innovative noise schedule during diffusion, retaining salient motions first.- Two strategies are proposed to assess motion token priority - static (based on entropy) and dynamic (RL agent).- Experiments show M2DM generates motions that better match complex descriptions than existing methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by utilizing discrete representations and a priority-aware diffusion process, the proposed M2DM model can generate higher fidelity and more diverse motions from complex textual descriptions compared to current state-of-the-art methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a priority-centric motion discrete diffusion model (M2DM) for generating diverse and precise human motions from text descriptions. This involves:1) Using a Transformer-based VQ-VAE to learn a concise, discrete motion representation. The model incorporates a global self-attention mechanism and a regularization term to prevent code collapse. 2) Developing a motion discrete diffusion model with a novel noise schedule where tokens are corrupted based on their significance in the overall motion sequence. This retains the most salient motions during the diffusion process.3) Introducing two strategies (static and dynamic assessment) to determine the priority or importance of each motion token for the noise schedule.- Demonstrating through experiments on two datasets (HumanML3D and KIT-ML) that the proposed M2DM model generates higher quality and more diverse motions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, especially for complex text descriptions.- Providing ablation studies showing the importance of the different components of the proposed VQ-VAE and diffusion model.In summary, the key contribution appears to be the priority-centric discrete diffusion model for text-to-motion generation that focuses on retaining the most salient motion information during diffusion by assessing token significance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach.
