# [Controllable Diverse Sampling for Diffusion Based Motion Behavior   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03981)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing trajectory prediction methods face challenges with mode averaging due to data imbalance and struggle to generate diverse, scene-compliant trajectories. 
- Methods relying on priors or generative models often suffer from mode collapse or averaging when trained on single ground truth data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called Controllable Diffusion Trajectory (CDT) that uses a conditional denoising diffusion model to generate diverse, controllable trajectories.

- It incorporates a mode classifier to estimate vehicle's behavior based on road information to guide trajectory sampling. 

- Transformer-based denoiser takes historical trajectories, maps, time steps and behavior tokens (straight, left turn, right turn) as input to generate trajectories.

- Behavior tokens explicitly control trajectory modalities to avoid data imbalance issues. Endpoint tokens can also be used to guide accurate trajectory generation.

Main Contributions:

- A conditional diffusion model based trajectory prediction framework with controllable behavior tokens for multimodal diverse trajectory generation.

- Behavior tokens enable explicit control over modalities to overcome data imbalance and mode collapse issues.

- Ablation studies validate the model components and diffusion steps.

- Experiments on Argoverse 2 dataset show the model generates more diverse and scene-compliant trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods. Endpoint conditioned model achieves excellent accuracy.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel multimodal motion prediction framework called Controllable Diffusion Trajectory (CDT) that uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a Transformer-based decoder to generate controllable and diverse trajectories. 

2. The model introduces behavior tokens such as going straight, turning left/right to control the trajectory modes and ensure diversity even with imbalanced data. It also uses predicted endpoints as tokens to guide accurate trajectory generation.

3. The model demonstrates superior performance on the Argoverse 2 benchmark, achieving excellent results in generating multimodal trajectories with high diversity and scene compliance.

4. Through experiments, the paper shows the controllability of the diffusion model to synthesize diverse trajectories by taking specific behavior tokens, which helps increase sample diversity especially for less common behaviors.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes using a conditional denoising diffusion model for trajectory prediction. How does this model allow for controllable, multimodal trajectory generation compared to other generative models like GANs or VAEs? 

2) The model incorporates both a mode classifier and behavior tokens as conditions to guide the trajectory sampling process. What is the rationale behind this dual conditioning approach? How do the classifier predictions and behavior tokens complement each other?

3) The paper evaluates performance using diversity and scene compliance metrics like ASD, FSD, and ECFL. Why are these metrics appropriate for this method? How do they capture key capabilities like multimodality and map alignment?

4) What modifications were made to the standard conditional diffusion model architecture to adapt it for trajectory prediction tasks? How does the inclusion of elements like the 1D convolutions and cross-attentions benefit sequence modeling?

5) The ablation studies analyze the impact of diffusion steps on performance and computational efficiency. What is the key trade-off regarding step number and what informed the final choice of 20 steps?

6) How does the classification performance demonstrated on the validation set lend confidence regarding the model's ability to accurately predict behavior modes? What role does this play in the overall framework?

7) Qualitative results suggest the behavior tokens enable sampling of diverse modes compared to the baseline. How might this capability be useful for addressing data imbalance issues in practice? 

8) The endpoint token setting (CDT-P) achieves high accuracy but sacrifices diversity. What explains this outcome and what are the potential use cases for each variant?

9) What steps were taken during training in terms of optimization, scheduling, and hyperparameter selection? What motivated these choices?

10) What are some limitations of the current method and how might the framework be extended to address areas like less common behaviors, agent attributes, and sampling efficiency?
