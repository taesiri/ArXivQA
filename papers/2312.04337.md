# [Multi-View Unsupervised Image Generation with Cross Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating novel views of objects from a single input image is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) require precise multi-view images with camera poses during training, which limits their scalability. Recent works address this by fine-tuning large pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion on synthetic data, but they often need additional post-processing and can suffer from quality issues due to domain gap between synthetic and real images.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel unsupervised pipeline called MIRAGE to train a pose-conditioned diffusion model from a dataset of real single-category images for novel view synthesis. The key ideas are:

1) Discover poses in the dataset by clustering DINOv2 visual features to identify visibility of parts. 

2) Train diffusion model conditioned on discovered discrete poses.

3) At inference, transfer attention keys/values from reference image to guide generation of novel views. 

4) Introduce a "hard attention guidance" technique to further improve consistency.

5) The resulting model generates high-quality, consistent novel views from a single image without any manual supervision.

Main Contributions:

- Unsupervised way to discover poses by comparing semantics and locations of parts

- Pose-conditioned diffusion model for controllable generation

- Adaptation of cross-frame attention to novel view synthesis 

- Proposed hard-attention guidance for better consistency

- State-of-the-art results in real image datasets like CompCars

- Robustness to diverse shapes and textures shown via synthetic datasets

The method solves an important problem in novel view synthesis in a completely unsupervised way and outperforms prior arts, while also generalizing robustly across domains.
