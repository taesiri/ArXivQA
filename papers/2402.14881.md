# [A Study on the Vulnerability of Test Questions against ChatGPT-based   Cheating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- ChatGPT can answer many test questions accurately, enabling students to potentially cheat on exams. This is a growing issue with the rise of remote learning.  
- It is important to understand how well ChatGPT can answer different types of test questions and determine techniques for creating questions that ChatGPT cannot easily answer.

Proposed Solution & Contributions  
- The authors analyzed over 10,000 medical school entrance exam questions by having ChatGPT attempt to answer them. 
- They uncovered trends in the types of questions ChatGPT answers more accurately vs inaccurately:
  - Structural complexity of questions does not affect ChatGPT's accuracy
  - Using multi-select questions only leads to a small drop in accuracy  
  - Adding extra choices has little effect
  - Questions with the word "except" lead to a 6% drop in accuracy 
  - Accuracy varies greatly based on topic (e.g. 71% in biochemistry vs 48% for dental)
  - ChatGPT strongly overpredicts "All of the above" or "None of the above" when incorrect
- They built an NLP classifier to predict if ChatGPT can accurately answer a question, with 60% accuracy and over 70% accuracy when highly confident.  
- Proposed techniques for creating more ChatGPT-resistant test questions.
- Overall, contributed analysis of ChatGPT's test-taking abilities and tools to help combat AI cheating issues.
