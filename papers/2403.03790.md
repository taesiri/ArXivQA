# [Popeye: A Unified Visual-Language Model for Multi-Source Ship Detection   from Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Ship detection from remote sensing (RS) imagery is challenging due to varying imaging sources (optical, SAR), ship appearances, and complex backgrounds. 
- Existing methods are limited to individual detection tasks on single imagery sources. A unified framework for multi-source ship detection is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection and segmentation.

Key Ideas:
- A unified labeling paradigm to convert different ship detection formats (HBB, OBB) into a uniform image-instruction-answer format.  
- A multi-modal feature fusion module to extract robust visual features from multiple encoders.
- Cross-modal alignment between visual and language features for better image understanding.
- Knowledge adaptation to transfer pre-trained model from natural images to ship RS domain.
- Integration with Segment Anything Model (SAM) for language-guided ship segmentation.

Main Contributions:
- First unified visual-language model for multi-source ship detection and segmentation through language interaction.
- A new multi-modal multi-source instruction dataset called MMShip with 81k examples constructed.  
- Significantly better performance than specialist models and other visual-language models for zero-shot detection.
- Accurate ship segmentation even for small and blurred ships.

In summary, the proposed Popeye model provides a unified framework leveraging visual-language alignment for robust multi-source ship detection and segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
