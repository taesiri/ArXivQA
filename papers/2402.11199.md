# [Direct Evaluation of Chain-of-Thought in Multi-hop Reasoning with   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show impressive reasoning abilities when prompted to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, prior work only evaluates answer accuracy, not reasoning correctness.

Proposed Solution
- This paper proposes a novel evaluation paradigm to assess LLMs' reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering using knowledge graphs (KGs). 

- It has two components:
   1) Discriminative evaluation: Feeds LLMs valid and invalid reasoning paths to see if they can identify validity. Tests knowledge of reasoning.
   2) Generative evaluation: Instructs LLMs to output structured CoT to parse into reasoning paths and validate against KGs. Tests accuracy of generated reasoning.

Main Contributions  
- Through experiments on 5 LLMs on 2 QA datasets requiring multi-step reasoning, the paper shows:
   1) LLMs have sufficient knowledge to conduct reasoning but limited in considering reasoning coherence and hallucination.
   2) There is a significant gap between answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the need to evaluate reasoning steps directly.   
   3) The reasoning gap worsens as model size increases, suggesting bigger models may have answer knowledge without needing to reason.
   4) Better prompting can improve both answer and reasoning accuracy but the gap remains.

In summary, the paper emphasizes the inadequacy of using only answer accuracy to evaluate reasoning skills of LLMs. It provides strong evidence that higher answer performance does not equate to more faithful reasoning. The proposed evaluation offers more nuanced insights into LLMs' interpretability and reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework to evaluate the chain-of-thought reasoning capability of large language models in multi-hop question answering, using knowledge graphs to validate the faithfulness of generated reasoning steps beyond just scoring final answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel evaluation framework to understand and directly analyze the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process of large language models (LLMs) in multi-hop question answering. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing both discriminative and generative evaluations to assess LLMs' reasoning capabilities. The discriminative evaluation tests whether LLMs can identify valid reasoning paths when provided options. The generative evaluation analyzes the faithfulness of LLMs' self-generated CoT reasoning. 

2) Grounding the CoT reasoning with knowledge graphs to convert the unstructured rationales into structured reasoning paths, allowing automatic verification of correctness.

3) Conducting experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with different sizes to reveal insights such as:
- LLMs have sufficient knowledge for reasoning but limited coherence in CoT generation.  
- There is a significant gap between answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the need to evaluate reasoning rather than just final answers.
- The gap worsens as model size increases, indicating bigger models may have the answers without needing to reason.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a way to directly evaluate the intermediate reasoning steps of LLMs instead of only assessing final answer accuracy. The proposed framework and findings pave the way for better understanding and improving the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning - A reasoning framework where language models generate a step-by-step explanation to arrive at an answer.

- Knowledge graphs (KGs) - Structured representations of facts and relations that can be used to verify the reasoning steps. 

- Discriminative evaluation - Assessing whether models can identify valid vs invalid reasoning paths.

- Generative evaluation - Evaluating the faithfulness of actually generated chain-of-thought reasoning by models. 

- Reasoning paths - Sequences of facts connected in a KG that reflect the reasoning process.

- Faithful reasoning - Reasoning that is factually correct, coherent, and leads to the right conclusion.

- Multi-hop question answering - QA tasks that require combining multiple facts to arrive at the answer.

- Prompt engineering - Using techniques like self-consistency and planning hints to improve model performance.

- Evaluation metrics - Accuracy, reasoning fidelity scores, edit distance to ground truth reasoning paths.

So in summary, the key focus is on evaluating and improving the multi-step explanatory reasoning capability of large language models using knowledge graphs and prompt engineering.
