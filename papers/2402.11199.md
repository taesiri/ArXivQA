# [Direct Evaluation of Chain-of-Thought in Multi-hop Reasoning with   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show impressive reasoning abilities when prompted to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, prior work only evaluates answer accuracy, not reasoning correctness.

Proposed Solution
- This paper proposes a novel evaluation paradigm to assess LLMs' reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering using knowledge graphs (KGs). 

- It has two components:
   1) Discriminative evaluation: Feeds LLMs valid and invalid reasoning paths to see if they can identify validity. Tests knowledge of reasoning.
   2) Generative evaluation: Instructs LLMs to output structured CoT to parse into reasoning paths and validate against KGs. Tests accuracy of generated reasoning.

Main Contributions  
- Through experiments on 5 LLMs on 2 QA datasets requiring multi-step reasoning, the paper shows:
   1) LLMs have sufficient knowledge to conduct reasoning but limited in considering reasoning coherence and hallucination.
   2) There is a significant gap between answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the need to evaluate reasoning steps directly.   
   3) The reasoning gap worsens as model size increases, suggesting bigger models may have answer knowledge without needing to reason.
   4) Better prompting can improve both answer and reasoning accuracy but the gap remains.

In summary, the paper emphasizes the inadequacy of using only answer accuracy to evaluate reasoning skills of LLMs. It provides strong evidence that higher answer performance does not equate to more faithful reasoning. The proposed evaluation offers more nuanced insights into LLMs' interpretability and reasoning abilities.
