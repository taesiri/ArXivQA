# [Online Prototype Learning for Online Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00301)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable continual learning models to learn incrementally from non-stationary data streams?Specifically, the paper identifies shortcut learning as a key factor resulting in biased features that are not robust or generalizable to new tasks/classes. To address this, the paper proposes an online prototype learning framework with two main components:1) Online Prototype Equilibrium (OPE): Learns representative and discriminative features through contrastive learning on online prototypes. This helps achieve an equilibrium status that separates seen classes well while learning new classes. 2) Adaptive Prototypical Feedback (APF): Leverages feedback from online prototypes to sense easily misclassified classes and enhance their decision boundaries.The overall goal is to learn features that are robust to shortcut learning, maintain discrimination among seen classes, and enable effective online continual learning. The central hypothesis is that the proposed online prototype learning framework can achieve superior performance compared to existing replay-based continual learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies shortcut learning as a key limiting factor for online continual learning (CL). The learned features in online CL may be biased and not generalizable to new tasks, which can negatively impact knowledge distillation. 2. It presents a new online prototype learning (OnPro) framework for online CL that addresses shortcut learning. The key components are:- Online Prototype Equilibrium (OPE): Learns representative features for each class and discriminative features between classes to achieve an equilibrium that separates seen classes well when learning new classes. This resists shortcut learning.- Adaptive Prototypical Feedback (APF): Leverages feedback from online prototypes to sense easily misclassified classes and enhance their boundaries. 3. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of OnPro over state-of-the-art online CL methods. OnPro significantly outperforms methods like ER and DVC that also use replay but don't address shortcut learning.In summary, the key contribution is identifying shortcut learning in online CL and proposing the OnPro framework to address it through online prototype learning and adaptive prototypical feedback. This leads to improved performance over prior online CL methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an online continual learning framework called Online Prototype Learning (OnPro) that learns representative and discriminative features through online prototype equilibrium and adaptive prototypical feedback to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
