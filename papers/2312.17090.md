# [Q-Align: Teaching LMMs for Visual Scoring via Discrete Text-Defined   Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurately evaluating visual content like images and videos remains an indispensable need in computer vision. Existing methods for tasks like image quality/aesthetic assessment and video quality assessment struggle to generalize across diverse content and often compromise performance when handling multiple datasets together. 

Proposed Solution - Q-Align:
The key insight is that human raters learn and judge based on discrete text-defined levels (e.g. excellent, good, fair) rather than specific scores. So the authors propose teaching large language models (LMMs) using these levels instead of scores. 

Specifically, they convert dataset scores to 5 rating levels, format them into instruction-response pairs to conduct visual instruction tuning on LMMs. During inference, they extract probabilities on each level, calculate weighted average to get the predicted score.

The proposed Q-Align achieves SOTA on 12 datasets across image quality, aesthetic and video quality assessment. A few-shot version is competitive using only 1/5th or 1/10th training data. It also allows freely combining datasets without performance drop.

Based on this, they propose OneAlign to unify all 3 tasks into a single model, enhancing generalization.

Main Contributions:
1) Effective syllabus to teach LMMs for visual scoring using discrete levels 
2) Q-Align family outperforms SOTA on diverse scoring tasks under one structure
3) OneAlign model unifies scoring tasks with improved generalization

The work pioneers using levels to align LMM predictions better with human ratings on visual scoring. Code and models are released to facilitate future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Q-Align, a method to teach large language models to accurately predict quality and aesthetic scores of images and videos by instructing them with discrete text-defined rating levels rather than direct numerical scores.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. An effective syllabus to teach large language models (LMMs) to score visual content by instructing them with discrete text-defined levels (e.g. "good", "poor") instead of direct numerical scores. This is shown to be much more effective, improving performance by around 10% compared to directly training LMMs to output scores.

2. A family of more capable visual assessors called Q-Align that achieve state-of-the-art performance on image quality assessment (IQA), image aesthetic assessment (IAA), and video quality assessment (VQA). Q-Align also shows competitive performance with much less training data and faster convergence.

3. A unified model called OneAlign that combines training data from IQA, IAA and VQA to create an all-in-one visual scorer. OneAlign shows improved generalization ability to unseen datasets across the three tasks compared to single-task models.

In summary, the main contribution is an innovative and effective syllabus for teaching LMMs to score visual content accurately and robustly, validated through state-of-the-art performance across multiple visual assessment tasks. The proposed methods open promising directions for utilizing LMMs in this domain.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Large multi-modality models (LMMs)
- Image quality assessment (IQA)  
- Image aesthetic assessment (IAA)
- Video quality assessment (VQA)
- Mean opinion scores (MOS)
- Rating levels (excellent, good, fair, poor, bad)
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
- Q-Align
- OneAlign
- Discrete text-defined levels 
- Visual scoring
- Supervised fine-tuning
- Cross-entropy loss

The paper proposes a human-emulating syllabus called Q-Align to teach LMMs to predict visual scores aligned with human opinions. This is done by training the LMMs on discrete text-defined rating levels rather than direct scores. The key ideas include converting existing scores to rating levels, training LMMs on instruction-response pairs using these levels, and converting the predicted levels back to scores during inference. The proposed Q-Align reaches state-of-the-art performance on IQA, IAA and VQA tasks. A unified model called OneAlign is also introduced to combine the three tasks. So the core focus is on effectively instructing LMMs for robust and accurate visual scoring across diverse visual content.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to convert continuous scores into 5 discrete text-defined rating levels during training. What is the rationale behind using rating levels instead of direct scores as training targets? How does this align better with human subjective studies?

2. During inference, the method derives scores from the predicted probabilities of rating levels. How is this process similar to deriving mean opinion scores (MOS) from human ratings? What are the mathematical connections? 

3. The method achieves strong performance even with fewer training data on IQA and IAA tasks. Why does teaching the model with rating levels improve its data efficiency? Does this indicate better activation of the model's prior knowledge?

4. The paper shows that directly using scores as targets leads to worse cross-dataset generalization. Why does the rating level approach generalize better to unseen distributions? Does it avoid certain dataset biases?

5. The OneAlign model unifies IQA, IAA and VQA in one structure. What modifications allow the model to take both images and videos as input? How does this benefit the three tasks?

6. With only sparse frame sampling, the method outperforms prior specialized VQA models. Does this indicate the language model is effectively modeling temporal context? How can performance be further improved?

7. The method ensembles with a specialized VQA model (FAST-VQA) for additional gains. What unique advantages does each model offer in the ensemble? How are they complementary?

8. Qualitative results show the model distinguishes finer score differences even when trained on discrete levels. Does this suggest an inherent ordinal understanding of rating concepts? How noteworthy is this emerging ability?

9. The paper emphasizes better activation of prior knowledge in foundations models. What evidence indicates this knowledge transfer? Can further pretraining better prime models for scoring tasks?

10. Rating levels are defined based on equal score intervals, but do human perceptions perfectly match this? Could more advanced mappings between scores and levels be explored?
