# [Q-Align: Teaching LMMs for Visual Scoring via Discrete Text-Defined   Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurately evaluating visual content like images and videos remains an indispensable need in computer vision. Existing methods for tasks like image quality/aesthetic assessment and video quality assessment struggle to generalize across diverse content and often compromise performance when handling multiple datasets together. 

Proposed Solution - Q-Align:
The key insight is that human raters learn and judge based on discrete text-defined levels (e.g. excellent, good, fair) rather than specific scores. So the authors propose teaching large language models (LMMs) using these levels instead of scores. 

Specifically, they convert dataset scores to 5 rating levels, format them into instruction-response pairs to conduct visual instruction tuning on LMMs. During inference, they extract probabilities on each level, calculate weighted average to get the predicted score.

The proposed Q-Align achieves SOTA on 12 datasets across image quality, aesthetic and video quality assessment. A few-shot version is competitive using only 1/5th or 1/10th training data. It also allows freely combining datasets without performance drop.

Based on this, they propose OneAlign to unify all 3 tasks into a single model, enhancing generalization.

Main Contributions:
1) Effective syllabus to teach LMMs for visual scoring using discrete levels 
2) Q-Align family outperforms SOTA on diverse scoring tasks under one structure
3) OneAlign model unifies scoring tasks with improved generalization

The work pioneers using levels to align LMM predictions better with human ratings on visual scoring. Code and models are released to facilitate future work.
