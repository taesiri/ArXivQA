# [CoPa: General Robotic Manipulation through Spatial Constraints of Parts   with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08248)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generalizable low-level robotic control for manipulation tasks is challenging. Learning-based methods like imitation learning and reinforcement learning require large amounts of training data and struggle with generalizability to novel scenarios. Existing methods utilizing foundation models have shown promise for high-level task planning but rely on complex prompt engineering and only have a coarse understanding of physical scenes, limiting their capability for precise manipulation requiring fine-grained physical understanding.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new framework called \method (Robotic Manipulation through Spatial Constraints of Parts) that leverages the common sense knowledge embedded in foundation vision-language models (VLMs) like GPT-4V to generate precise 6-DOF end-effector poses for manipulation tasks. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Decompose manipulation into task-oriented grasping and task-aware motion planning. 
(2) Identify task-relevant parts through a novel coarse-to-fine grounding mechanism using VLMs and visual prompts.
(3) Generate spatial geometry constraints of task-relevant parts using VLMs. Solve for end-effector poses satisfying these constraints.

Main Contributions:
(1) A new framework for robotic manipulation leveraging common sense knowledge in VLMs requiring minimal prompt engineering and no additional training.
(2) A coarse-to-fine grounding module for fine-grained physical understanding.
(3) Spatial constraints based interface between VLMs and robots.
(4) Real-world experiments on 10 tasks showing 63% average success rate, significantly outperforming baseline.
(5) Demonstration of integration with high-level planners for complex long-horizon tasks.

The key advantage is the fine-grained physical understanding of scenes enabling generalizability, in contrast to coarse understanding of prior VLM-based methods. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness.
