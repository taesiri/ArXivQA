# [LivePose: Online 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video with Dynamic   Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00054)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can dense 3D reconstruction systems handle dynamically changing camera pose estimates from SLAM in real-time online operation?

Specifically, the paper investigates how various state-of-the-art reconstruction systems can be adapted to properly handle pose updates from SLAM, which often occur due to events like loop closures and pose graph optimization. The traditional assumption of static poses for each camera view does not hold in real-world online scanning scenarios.

The key ideas proposed and validated are:

- Formalizing the problem of online reconstruction with dynamic poses as a new computer vision task.

- Developing a generalized framework of linear and learned non-linear de-integration operators to "undo" the effects of past views before re-integrating them with updated poses.

- Releasing a novel dataset called LivePose containing full dynamic pose streams for ScanNet scenes.

- Demonstrating how the proposed de-integration strategies enable state-of-the-art systems like Atlas, NeuralRecon, and DeepVideoMVS to properly respond to pose updates.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly handling pose updates through de-integration will improve the accuracy and coherence of online 3D reconstructions from dynamically posed camera views. The experiments validate this claim across multiple state-of-the-art systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Introducing and formalizing the new task of dense online 3D reconstruction from dynamically-posed RGB images. This setting reflects real-world conditions where camera poses estimated by SLAM systems get updated over time. 

- Releasing the LivePose dataset, which contains full dynamic pose streams for all scans in the ScanNet dataset. This is the first publicly available dataset with complete dynamic pose information.

- Developing training and evaluation protocols to support reconstruction with dynamic poses, including generating incremental ground truth meshes.

- Proposing a framework to handle pose updates via de-integration and re-integration for different reconstruction methods. This includes a novel learned de-integration module for methods with non-linear integration like NeuralRecon.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the de-integration approach through experiments on ScanNet using LivePose. The proposed solutions lead to improved reconstruction quality for several state-of-the-art RGB-only reconstruction methods when evaluated on dynamic poses.

In summary, the paper formalizes and provides solutions for the novel task of online 3D reconstruction from images with dynamically changing poses. The LivePose dataset, proposed methods, and experiments aim to enable further research in this practical but previously untreated setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the new task of online 3D reconstruction from monocular video in dynamic scenes where camera poses may be updated, proposes a de-integration framework to enable existing RGB reconstruction methods to handle these pose updates, and releases a dataset of live camera poses to support further research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper on live online 3D reconstruction compares to other related work:

- Most prior work in monocular 3D reconstruction has assumed static, fully-optimized camera poses for each input view. This paper argues that a practical system must handle dynamic pose estimates from real-time SLAM, and proposes methods to address this.

- The paper introduces a new dataset called LivePose, which provides full dynamic pose sequences on ScanNet. This is the first such dataset and will enable more research on online reconstruction.

- For handling dynamic poses, the paper adapts three recent reconstruction approaches (DeepVideoMVS, Atlas, NeuralRecon) using a framework based on de-integration and re-integration. This is a generalization of the strategy used in RGB-D systems like BundleFusion.

- A key contribution is a learned de-integration module that removes the effect of stale views with outdated poses. This enables online reconstruction with non-linear integration like NeuralRecon, which was not possible before.

- The experiments show that explicitly handling pose updates is critical for quality and coherence. The proposed de-integration approach is shown to be effective across different integration strategies.

- Compared to systems like BundleFusion, this work focuses specifically on the monocular setting without depth camera input. The monocular case presents additional challenges for de-integration and update handling.

- The method is evaluated thoroughly on ScanNet using the LivePose data. Previous works have not evaluated incremental, online reconstructions or used dynamic ground truth.

Overall, this paper identifies the problem of dynamic poses in online monocular reconstruction, provides data and solutions to address it, and demonstrates improved reconstruction quality by handling pose updates. The de-integration strategy generalizes across methods and enables online operation.
