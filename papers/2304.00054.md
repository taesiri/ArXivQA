# [LivePose: Online 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video with Dynamic   Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00054)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can dense 3D reconstruction systems handle dynamically changing camera pose estimates from SLAM in real-time online operation?

Specifically, the paper investigates how various state-of-the-art reconstruction systems can be adapted to properly handle pose updates from SLAM, which often occur due to events like loop closures and pose graph optimization. The traditional assumption of static poses for each camera view does not hold in real-world online scanning scenarios.

The key ideas proposed and validated are:

- Formalizing the problem of online reconstruction with dynamic poses as a new computer vision task.

- Developing a generalized framework of linear and learned non-linear de-integration operators to "undo" the effects of past views before re-integrating them with updated poses.

- Releasing a novel dataset called LivePose containing full dynamic pose streams for ScanNet scenes.

- Demonstrating how the proposed de-integration strategies enable state-of-the-art systems like Atlas, NeuralRecon, and DeepVideoMVS to properly respond to pose updates.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly handling pose updates through de-integration will improve the accuracy and coherence of online 3D reconstructions from dynamically posed camera views. The experiments validate this claim across multiple state-of-the-art systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Introducing and formalizing the new task of dense online 3D reconstruction from dynamically-posed RGB images. This setting reflects real-world conditions where camera poses estimated by SLAM systems get updated over time. 

- Releasing the LivePose dataset, which contains full dynamic pose streams for all scans in the ScanNet dataset. This is the first publicly available dataset with complete dynamic pose information.

- Developing training and evaluation protocols to support reconstruction with dynamic poses, including generating incremental ground truth meshes.

- Proposing a framework to handle pose updates via de-integration and re-integration for different reconstruction methods. This includes a novel learned de-integration module for methods with non-linear integration like NeuralRecon.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the de-integration approach through experiments on ScanNet using LivePose. The proposed solutions lead to improved reconstruction quality for several state-of-the-art RGB-only reconstruction methods when evaluated on dynamic poses.

In summary, the paper formalizes and provides solutions for the novel task of online 3D reconstruction from images with dynamically changing poses. The LivePose dataset, proposed methods, and experiments aim to enable further research in this practical but previously untreated setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the new task of online 3D reconstruction from monocular video in dynamic scenes where camera poses may be updated, proposes a de-integration framework to enable existing RGB reconstruction methods to handle these pose updates, and releases a dataset of live camera poses to support further research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper on live online 3D reconstruction compares to other related work:

- Most prior work in monocular 3D reconstruction has assumed static, fully-optimized camera poses for each input view. This paper argues that a practical system must handle dynamic pose estimates from real-time SLAM, and proposes methods to address this.

- The paper introduces a new dataset called LivePose, which provides full dynamic pose sequences on ScanNet. This is the first such dataset and will enable more research on online reconstruction.

- For handling dynamic poses, the paper adapts three recent reconstruction approaches (DeepVideoMVS, Atlas, NeuralRecon) using a framework based on de-integration and re-integration. This is a generalization of the strategy used in RGB-D systems like BundleFusion.

- A key contribution is a learned de-integration module that removes the effect of stale views with outdated poses. This enables online reconstruction with non-linear integration like NeuralRecon, which was not possible before.

- The experiments show that explicitly handling pose updates is critical for quality and coherence. The proposed de-integration approach is shown to be effective across different integration strategies.

- Compared to systems like BundleFusion, this work focuses specifically on the monocular setting without depth camera input. The monocular case presents additional challenges for de-integration and update handling.

- The method is evaluated thoroughly on ScanNet using the LivePose data. Previous works have not evaluated incremental, online reconstructions or used dynamic ground truth.

Overall, this paper identifies the problem of dynamic poses in online monocular reconstruction, provides data and solutions to address it, and demonstrates improved reconstruction quality by handling pose updates. The de-integration strategy generalizes across methods and enables online operation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential directions for future work:

- Testing de-integration on additional reconstruction methods, especially ones with learned non-linear integration like VoRTX. They note that their proposed learned de-integration module could likely be applied to enable pose update handling in other systems.

- Exploring alternative strategies for pose update filtering/scheduling between the SLAM system and reconstruction system, to optimize the tradeoff between latency and accuracy.

- Evaluating the proposed methods on additional dynamic pose datasets beyond LivePose.

- Investigating whether the live training protocol could be improved, for example by synthesizing more varied/extreme pose update distributions during training.

- Developing solutions to allow "forgetting" in the reconstruction, gradually removing very old scene content, to control the unbounded growth of the representation over long scans.

- Extending the methodology to support full 6-DOF camera motion, expanding beyond the gravity-aligned trajectory setting that was studied.

- Adapting the system to leverage information from inertial sensors to aid in tracking and handling rapid motion.

In summary, they highlight the need for further research into training strategies, pose update scheduling policies, alternative de-integration solutions, evaluation on more diverse data, and extensions to support unconstrained 6-DOF motion with additional sensing modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper introduces the new task of online monocular 3D reconstruction using dynamically changing camera poses from SLAM. The authors formalize this problem setting and propose using de-integration as a general framework to handle pose updates. They introduce a new dataset called LivePose which contains dynamic SLAM pose streams for all scans in ScanNet. The authors select 3 recent RGB reconstruction methods (DeepVideoMVS, Atlas, NeuralRecon) and modify each using de-integration to handle pose updates. For NeuralRecon, they propose a learned de-integration module based on a recurrent neural network which learns to remove the effects of stale observations. Experiments show that applying de-integration improves reconstruction accuracy and coherence compared to not handling pose updates. The proposed solutions demonstrate that de-integration is an effective approach to enable online 3D reconstruction methods to remain synchronized with a dynamic SLAM system.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new problem setting and method for online 3D reconstruction from monocular RGB video. Traditional reconstruction methods assume static camera poses for each input view. However, in online systems the poses estimated by SLAM are dynamic, being continually updated due to events like loop closure and bundle adjustment. The authors formalize the task of dense online reconstruction with these dynamic poses. To enable research on this task, they introduce a novel dataset called LivePose which contains full pose streams estimated using BundleFusion for the ScanNet dataset. 

The main contribution is a framework to handle pose updates by de-integrating past views using old poses, then re-integrating them using the updated pose estimates. They apply this framework to adapt three recent RGB reconstruction methods (DeepVideoMVS, Atlas, NeuralRecon) for online operation. For NeuralRecon's learned integration, they propose a novel learned de-integration module implemented as a convolutional GRU. Experiments demonstrate that explicitly handling pose updates is critical for high-quality online reconstruction. The proposed de-integration strategies are shown to be effective, producing improved quantitative results on ScanNet using the LivePose data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

This paper proposes using de-integration as a general framework for handling pose updates in online 3D reconstruction from RGB images. The key idea is that when the SLAM system issues a pose update for a past camera view, the contribution of that view should first be removed (de-integrated) from the current reconstruction before re-integrating it using the updated pose. The authors study three representative RGB-only reconstruction methods (DeepVideoMVS, Atlas, and NeuralRecon) and apply modifications to enable pose update handling via de-integration. For DeepVideoMVS and Atlas, which use linear integration, standard de-integration strategies are applied. For NeuralRecon, which uses learned non-linear integration, the authors propose a novel learned de-integration module based on a convolutional GRU that removes stale content. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset with simulated online SLAM streams demonstrate the effectiveness of de-integration for improving reconstruction quality and coherence. The authors also release a new dataset called LivePose containing dynamic SLAM poses for ScanNet scenes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem being addressed is how to perform real-time, online 3D reconstruction from a stream of RGB images when the camera poses estimated by SLAM may be dynamically updated over time (e.g. due to loop closure or optimization). 

The traditional assumption in 3D reconstruction is that camera poses are fixed and known for each input view. But in an online setting, the poses estimated by SLAM can change over time as more data is gathered. Ignoring these pose updates leads to inconsistencies between the SLAM system and the reconstruction.

The main contributions are:

- Formalizing the task of "online 3D reconstruction from dynamically-posed images". 

- Introducing a dataset called LivePose with full dynamic pose streams for the ScanNet dataset.

- Proposing a general framework to handle pose updates using linear or learned de-integration strategies.

- Showing how the framework can be applied to different recent reconstruction methods like Atlas, NeuralRecon, and DeepVideoMVS.

- Demonstrating improved reconstruction quality when handling pose updates, especially with the proposed learned de-integration module.

So in summary, the key problem is enabling high-quality online 3D reconstruction that respects the dynamic nature of the camera poses estimated by SLAM systems. The paper introduces the problem, provides a dataset, and presents solutions to align the reconstruction with the changing pose estimates.
