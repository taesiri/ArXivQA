# [Wordflow: Social Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 require well-crafted prompts to function effectively. However, designing good prompts, known as prompt engineering, is very challenging, especially for non-experts unfamiliar with AI. Existing tools for assisting with prompt engineering mainly target AI developers rather than everyday users. There is a need for interfaces that can help non-expert users easily create, run, and share prompts.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "social prompt engineering", which uses social computing techniques to facilitate collaborative prompt design. The authors introduce Wordflow, an open-source text editor that allows everyday users to easily create, run, share and discover LLM prompts. Key capabilities of Wordflow include:

- An editor view with a simple interface for writing text, applying prompts to transform the text using LLMs, and inspecting the changes made. 

- A personal prompt library for managing, editing, and sharing prompts.

- A community prompt hub to search, browse, copy prompts shared by others.

- Support for running prompts with remote API services as well as local on-device LLM models using WebGPU.

Main Contributions:

1) Introducing social prompt engineering paradigm and Wordflow system to investigate how social techniques can aid prompt engineering for non-experts.

2) Implementing an open source web-based system with easy-to-use interfaces tailored for everyday users to interact with LLMs. Enables running prompts privately using local models.

3) Two usage scenarios highlighting how social prompt engineering can enhance interactions with LLMs for improving technical writing and customizing translation styles.

4) Discussion of future work including workflow integration, promoting user engagement, fostering responsible AI practices, and a planned study to evaluate social prompt engineering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Wordflow, an open-source social text editor that enables collaborative prompt engineering to help everyday users easily create, run, share, and discover prompts for large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing "social prompt engineering", a new paradigm that leverages social computing techniques like sharing, curation, and discovery to facilitate collaborative prompt design between everyday users of large language models (LLMs). 

2. Introducing Wordflow, an open-source and social text editor that allows everyday users to easily create, run, share, and discover prompts for LLMs. Key features include a text editor to apply prompts, a personal prompt library, a community prompt hub, and support for both remote and local LLMs.

3. Discussing two usage scenarios that demonstrate how Wordflow and social prompt engineering can enhance non-expert users' interactions with LLMs for tasks like improving technical writing and customizing translation styles.

4. Outlining future research directions like integrating Wordflow into workflows, promoting user engagement through gaming concepts, fostering responsible AI practices, and conducting a usage log study to evaluate social prompt engineering.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and investigating social prompt engineering through the design and development of Wordflow, an open-source social text editor for everyday LLM users.

Usage scenarios demonstrate how social prompt engineering through tools like Wordflow can aid everyday users. Finally, the authors discuss future work around integrating workflows, promoting user engagement and responsible AI practices, and conducting studies to evaluate social prompt engineering.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Wordflow's social prompt engineering approach facilitate more effective prompt design compared to existing prompt engineering tools that do not incorporate social features? What are the unique advantages and disadvantages?

2. The paper discusses integrating workflows as an area of future work. What are some specific ideas for seamlessly integrating Wordflow into existing user workflows like email, documents, etc. to minimize disruption? How might this impact adoption and usability?

3. What are some ways the authors could expand the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in Wordflow to further promote user engagement with the community prompt sharing system? How might these impact participation rates? 

4. How can the concept of social prompt engineering be expanded beyond Wordflow? What other interfaces and systems could benefit from incorporating collaborative prompting features?

5. The authors plan to use Wordflow as a research instrument for studying collaborative prompt engineering through usage log analysis. What specific research questions beyond the two mentioned could usage logs help answer?

6. What additional tools, controls, and interfaces could be built into Wordflow to help foster responsible AI practices and mitigate potential harms from language models?

7. How can the on-device language model support be expanded to make local models more performant, usable, and widely adopted? What specific technical hurdles need to be addressed?

8. What are some ways prompt popularity metrics could be improved or supplemented to better recommend relevant prompts to users? Could more advanced recommendation algorithms be helpful?

9. How can Wordflow help analyze the landscape of everyday users' prompting needs and language model use cases? What can we learn about prompting requirements for mainstream applications?

10. If widely adopted, how might Wordflow impact the future development and training of language models? Could community prompts help models learn?
