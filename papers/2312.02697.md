# [Hierarchical Visual Policy Learning for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation   in Densely Cluttered Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02697)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a vision-based hierarchical policy called HCLM for long-horizon robot manipulation tasks in densely cluttered scenes. HCLM consists of a high-level policy and three low-level options that coordinate three action primitives: push, pick, and place. It utilizes a two-stream Transporter network trained by behavior cloning to model the pick and place options. The high-level policy and push option are modeled concurrently by a proposed Dual-Level Action Network and trained via hierarchical reinforcement learning. During training, the paper introduces two key techniques - a Spatially Extended Q-update to augment push updates and a Two-Stage Update Scheme to alleviate non-stationarity for the high-level policy. Experiments on a diverse cluttered manipulation benchmark demonstrate HCLM's ability to efficiently solve complex tasks and generalize to increased clutter. Ablations validate the contribution of each proposed component. Overall, the hierarchical structure and hybrid training approach allow HCLM to effectively leverage different primitives and overcome challenges like sparse rewards and occlusion in long-horizon cluttered-scene manipulation.
