# [Hierarchical Visual Policy Learning for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation   in Densely Cluttered Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02697)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a vision-based hierarchical policy called HCLM for long-horizon robot manipulation tasks in densely cluttered scenes. HCLM consists of a high-level policy and three low-level options that coordinate three action primitives: push, pick, and place. It utilizes a two-stream Transporter network trained by behavior cloning to model the pick and place options. The high-level policy and push option are modeled concurrently by a proposed Dual-Level Action Network and trained via hierarchical reinforcement learning. During training, the paper introduces two key techniques - a Spatially Extended Q-update to augment push updates and a Two-Stage Update Scheme to alleviate non-stationarity for the high-level policy. Experiments on a diverse cluttered manipulation benchmark demonstrate HCLM's ability to efficiently solve complex tasks and generalize to increased clutter. Ablations validate the contribution of each proposed component. Overall, the hierarchical structure and hybrid training approach allow HCLM to effectively leverage different primitives and overcome challenges like sparse rewards and occlusion in long-horizon cluttered-scene manipulation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a vision-based hierarchical policy called HCLM that coordinates push, pick, and place primitives through a high-level policy and options to efficiently accomplish long-horizon manipulation tasks in densely cluttered scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1) Proposing a vision-based Hierarchical Policy for Cluttered-scene Long-horizon Manipulation (HCLM) to accomplish tasks by coordinating push, pick, and place primitives. 

2) Proposing two heuristic methods, SEQ (Spatially Extended Q-update) and TSUS (Two-Stage Update Scheme), to augment Q-value updates and mitigate the non-stationary transition problem in hierarchical reinforcement learning.

3) Conducting extensive comparisons with baselines on diverse cluttered-scene long-horizon manipulation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experiments show that HCLM outperforms the baselines in terms of success rate and efficiency on the tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that can efficiently learn policies to perform long-horizon manipulation tasks in cluttered scenes by coordinating basic action primitives. The proposed methods SEQ and TSUS help improve the training of this framework.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical policy structure with a high-level policy and three options. Why is this hierarchical structure beneficial for long-horizon manipulation tasks compared to a flat policy structure? 

2. The pick and place options are modeled using a two-stream Transporter trained by behavior cloning. What are the advantages of using behavior cloning here compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning?

3. The paper introduces a Spatially Extended Q-update (SEQ) to augment updates for the push option. Explain the intuition behind using an anisotropic Gaussian distribution to model the outcomes of push actions. 

4. The Two-Stage Update Scheme (TSUS) is proposed to alleviate non-stationary transitions for the high-level policy. Walk through the details of how TSUS controls the high-level policy's updates. What is the intuition behind this scheme?

5. The paper evaluates the method on the ClutteredRavens benchmark. Explain the rationale behind the design of the six cluttered-scene manipulation tasks included. How do they differ in complexity and attributes?

6. Analyze the results in Table 2. Why does the inclusion of random pushes actually hurt performance compared to just pick and place? What does this imply about push actions?

7. The method shows an ability to generalize to environments with increasing numbers of clutter objects. Discuss why this is an important capability and the factors that contribute to this generalization.  

8. Walk through the ablation studies in Table 4. What do the results imply about the necessity of different components of the proposed method?

9. Discuss potential ways to further improve the sample efficiency and wall-clock time efficiency of training the proposed method.

10. The paper focuses on explicit coordination of three action primitives. Discuss how the framework could be extended to incorporate additional primitives like grasp and how that would expand the space of tasks addressable.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on addressing the challenge of long-horizon manipulation tasks in densely cluttered scenes. Such tasks require policies that can effectively manage severe occlusions among objects and continually produce actions based on visual observations over prolonged periods. Prior works have limitations in either assuming no/less occlusions or requiring full state information. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a vision-based Hierarchical Policy for Cluttered-scene Long-horizon Manipulation (HCLM) that coordinates three action primitives - push, pick and place. The policy comprises a high-level policy to select primitive(s) to execute, and three low-level options to output parameters for each primitive. 

Specifically, a Dual-Level Action Network (DLAN) combining a two-stream architecture and two output branches is used to model the high-level policy and push option. A two-stream Transporter trained by behavior cloning (BC) is used for the pick and place options. During hierarchical reinforcement learning to train DLAN, two techniques are introduced:

1) Spatially Extended Q-update (SEQ): Augments Q-value update for the push option by spreading the Q-value from one pixel to a local region using anisotropic Gaussian distribution.

2) Two-Stage Update Scheme (TSUS): Alleviates non-stationary transition issue in updating high-level policy by using only successful push experiences initially, and all non-random pushes later.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a vision-based hierarchical policy (HCLM) that coordinates push, pick and place primitives to address long-horizon cluttered-scene manipulation.

2) Introduces two techniques - SEQ and TSUS to enhance hierarchical reinforcement learning.

3) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance over baselines on a range of cluttered long-horizon tasks and generalizability to more cluttered scenes.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in effectively learning policies that can perform complex long-horizon manipulation tasks in dense clutter solely from visual inputs.
