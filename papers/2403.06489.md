# [Graph Neural Network with Two Uplift Estimators for Label-Scarcity   Individual Uplift Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Graph Neural Network with Two Uplift Estimators for Label-Scarcity Individual Uplift Modeling":

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of uplift modeling, which aims to estimate the incremental effect (uplift) of an action on an individual's outcome. Key challenges are that (1) individual features may not fully capture complex factors affecting uplift, and (2) there is typically scarce labeled data, especially for the treatment group. This is more severe for graph-based models which require more parameters.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Graph Neural Network-based framework (GNUM) with two uplift estimators that incorporate social graph information to address the above issues. 

First, a graph neural network leverages user features and graph structure to learn representations. Breadth and depth aggregators capture local and global graph properties.

The first estimator uses a class-transformed target that combines treatment and control groups to approach the uplift. This handles any outcome type and limited labels.  

The second estimator uses partial labels for discrete outcomes. Two classifiers focus on different uplift facets but jointly leverage the two groups, further alleviating label scarcity.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and address the key problem of label scarcity for graph-based uplift modeling
- Propose a GNN framework with two uplift estimators to incorporate social graph information and handle limited labels
- The first estimator uses a class-transformed target for any outcome type and both groups
- The second estimator uses partial labels for discrete outcomes to further leverage the two groups 
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance and robustness to label scarcity

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in uplift modeling by tackling the key issue of label scarcity for graph-based models through an effective GNN framework and two tailored uplift estimators.
