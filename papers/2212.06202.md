# [Doubly Right Object Recognition: A Why Prompt for Visual Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06202)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: Can computer vision models provide both correct categorical predictions as well as correct explanations (rationales) for their predictions?The key points are:- Existing computer vision models are evaluated only on classification accuracy, not on whether they provide correct explanations for their decisions. - Providing correct explanations is important for trustworthy AI systems, especially in critical applications like healthcare.- Current methods for generating explanations either produce vague saliency maps or require expensive manual annotation of rationales. - The authors propose using language models and web search to automatically collect explanatory rationales at scale.- They introduce a new "doubly right" benchmark that requires models to output both correct categories and rationales.- Experiments show current vision models often provide wrong rationales, even when categories are correct.- A novel "why" prompt is proposed to adapt models to produce better rationales, demonstrated quantitatively and qualitatively.In summary, the central hypothesis is that vision models can be adapted via prompting to produce both correct categorical predictions and explanatory rationales on a large-scale benchmark. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing the problem of "doubly right" object recognition, where models must predict both the correct category and provide the correct rationale for their prediction. This is posed as a new challenge for visual recognition models.2. Constructing a large-scale benchmark dataset spanning multiple existing image datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet, that contains category labels and rationale annotations. This allows quantitative evaluation of models on the doubly right task.3. Proposing a method to transfer reasoning knowledge from language models to visual models via prompt learning. Specifically, they use GPT-3 to generate rationales for object categories, then collect paired images using Google search, and finally learn a "why" visual prompt to adapt models like CLIP to produce better rationales.4. Demonstrating quantitative and qualitative improvements on the doubly right recognition task using their prompt learning method, both on their collected datasets and on established datasets like ImageNet. The prompts help reduce cases where models predict the right category but wrong rationale.5. Analyzing the ability to produce hierarchical and multi-level rationales using additional prompting.So in summary, they introduced and constructed a benchmark for this new visually reasoned recognition task, proposed a way to transfer reasoning knowledge from language to vision models via prompting, and demonstrated improvements in rationale generation and doubly right recognition accuracy. The ability to produce better visual rationales in models is posed as an important direction for further progress in visual recognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new "doubly right" object recognition benchmark where models must predict both the correct object category and provide plausible rationales, showing existing vision models like CLIP often fail this but visual prompts transferring reasoning from language models significantly improves performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in visual reasoning and explainability:- The focus on evaluating models on both correctness of predictions and rationales ("doubly right") is novel. Most prior work has focused only on accuracy of predictions, not rationales. This paper proposes a new metric and benchmark for measuring if models can provide correct rationales.- The idea of using prompting to elicit visual rationales is inspired by recent advances in prompting language models, but adapting it to the visual domain is a new contribution. The visual "why" prompt is a creative way to transfer reasoning abilities from language to vision models.- The method of using GPT-3 and Google image search to automatically generate a large-scale dataset with rationales is clever. This allows creating a diverse benchmark more efficiently than manual annotation. Most prior visual rationale datasets are small-scale and limited in domain.- The proposed pipeline allows quantitative evaluation of rationale quality at a much larger scale compared to prior work. Many prior methods for visual rationales are limited to qualitative analysis. The ranking metric for rationale correctness enables quantitative benchmarking.- The zero-shot transfer results are impressive. The visual prompts improve rationale quality even on unseen datasets, suggesting the method encodes some generalizable reasoning abilities. This is a promising result for transferring reasoning to new domains.- Analysis of hierarchical, multi-level rationales is novel. Prior work has focused on only one-level rationales. The sub-rationale experiments show these models have potential for more complex, hierarchical reasoning.Overall, the doubly-right recognition task, scalable data collection, quantitative rationale benchmarking, and visual prompting seem like significant contributions compared to prior work. The paper makes a compelling case that predicting rationales, not just categories, is an important direction for visual recognition.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing methods to further improve the "doubly right" performance of vision models on larger-scale and more diverse datasets. The authors show promising results on several datasets, but note there is still room for improvement, especially on very large and complex datasets like ImageNet.- Exploring whether the visual "why" prompting method can be applied to other vision tasks beyond object recognition, such as visual question answering, action recognition, etc. The authors suggest the prompting approach could potentially improve performance and interpretability on a wide range of vision tasks.- Investigating hierarchical and multi-step visual reasoning, where models are able to provide chains of explanations about their reasoning process. The authors show some initial experiments with multi-level rationales, but suggest more work is needed in this direction.- Combining visual prompting with other methods like disentangled representations and causal modeling to produce more robust and generalizable visual rationales. The authors note their method currently relies on correlations in the training data.- Developing better evaluation metrics and benchmarks for the doubly right task, especially ones that incorporate human judgments about the quality of rationales. The authors use mainly automated metrics in this work.- Exploring the social impacts and ethical considerations of having vision models that can explain their reasoning, which could raise issues like trust in incorrect rationales.So in summary, the main directions pointed out are: improving performance on larger datasets, transferring the method to new tasks, enabling deeper multi-step reasoning, combining prompting with other methods, developing better evaluation, and considering societal impacts. The overall goal is moving towards more interpretable and trustworthy vision models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces the problem of "doubly right" object recognition, where models must predict both the correct category label and provide the correct rationale to justify the prediction. Existing models like CLIP achieve high accuracy but often fail to provide good rationales. The authors propose generating rationales using GPT-3's knowledge, collecting matched images via Google, and training "why" prompts to adapt vision models. Experiments show this improves rationale quality on a new large-scale benchmark. Key results are that prompting boosts doubly right accuracy substantially over CLIP, transfers to unseen datasets in zero-shot settings, and can provide hierarchical rationales. Overall, the work highlights the need for models to be "doubly right" in predictions and rationales, and shows prompting as a way to achieve this. The new benchmark and adapted models are a step towards more explainable vision systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces the problem of "doubly right" object recognition, where models must predict the correct object category as well as provide the right rationale to justify the prediction. Existing models like CLIP achieve high accuracy on object classification but often give incorrect rationales. The authors collect a new dataset that contains object categories paired with plausible rationales obtained from GPT-3 and Google image search. They propose learning a "why prompt" to adapt vision models like CLIP to produce better rationales, by optimizing the prompt with a contrastive loss between images and rationale text. Experiments show the why prompt significantly improves the doubly right accuracy over baselines, and can transfer rationales to unseen datasets in a zero-shot manner. The paper provides a new benchmark and method to move visual recognition towards correctly justified predictions.
