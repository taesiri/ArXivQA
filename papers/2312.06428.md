# [VisionTraj: A Noise-Robust Trajectory Recovery Framework based on   Large-scale Camera Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Reconstructing complete vehicle trajectories from sparse location captures obtained from multi-camera networks is challenging due to lack of open training datasets and vulnerability to noise in visual recognition (e.g. failures in license plate recognition).

Proposed Solution - VisionTraj
- A two-stage framework composed of noise-robust vision clustering and learning-based trajectory generation.

Key Components:
1) Fine- and Coarse-Grained Clustering 
   - Performs clustering using two similarity thresholds to get high precision small clusters and high recall big clusters.
   - Uses a GCN model to identify false positives based on spatiotemporal correlations between captures.

2) Tracklet Augmentation
   - Extracts vehicle's entry/exit actions from tracklets in each camera's view.
   - Provides strong contextual cues on preceding/succeeding road segments to help identify correct trajectories.

Model:
- Formulates problem as autoregressive generation task conditioned on clustered captures. 
- Uses Transformer architecture with tracklet-augmented input and soft-denoising from hierarchical clustering.

Datasets:
- Releases two datasets with vision captures and trajectories to enable supervised learning:
   (1) Sewed-ViTraj: Real captures + simulated trajectories
   (2) Simulated-ViTraj: Fully simulated city environment and vehicle mobility

Main Contributions:
- Novel data-driven approach to trajectory recovery robust towards vision noise
- Innovative combination of soft-denoising and tracklet augmentation
- Public datasets linking vision captures with trajectories to advance research

Performance:
- Outperforms previous heuristic rule-based methods by up to +11.5% IoU
- Downstream tasks like clustering and speed monitoring also show accuracy improvements

In summary, the paper proposes VisionTraj, an end-to-end learning framework with two plug-and-play modules for noise-robust trajectory recovery from multi-camera networks. Released datasets and strong performance demonstrate its effectiveness over prior arts.
