# [VisionTraj: A Noise-Robust Trajectory Recovery Framework based on   Large-scale Camera Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06428)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VisionTraj, a novel learning-based framework for recovering vehicle trajectories from sparse snapshots captured by urban road network cameras. The key innovation is the introduction of two components to tackle the inherent noise in vision-based vehicle re-identification clustering: (1) a fine- and coarse-grained soft denoising module based on graph convolutional networks that identifies likely false positives, and (2) augmentation of road node information using tracklet data to provide local vehicle behavior details. The framework uses Transformer architecture in an autoregressive manner to generate full trajectories conditioned on the cluster information. To enable research, the authors construct two datasets: one by stitching real captures with simulated trajectories, and one fully simulated using SUMO and CARLA. Experiments demonstrate VisionTraj's ability to reconstruct trajectories closer to ground truth compared to baselines, with over 11.5% IoU improvement on one dataset. Downstream applications in clustering feedback and road-level speed monitoring also showcase practical usefulness. Overall, this data-driven approach advances the state-of-the-art in vision-based trajectory recovery through noise-robust components and new datasets.
