# [Exchange-of-Thought: Enhancing Large Language Model Capabilities through   Cross-Model Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01823)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Exchange-of-Thought (EoT), a novel framework that enables cross-model communication between large language models (LLMs) during problem-solving. EoT is designed to provide LLMs with external insights and perspectives to augment their reasoning capabilities. The authors draw inspiration from network topologies to develop four communication paradigms - Memory, Report, Relay, and Debate, each facilitating different dynamics of idea exchange between models. A confidence evaluation mechanism is introduced to mitigate the influence of erroneous reasoning chains. Experiments demonstrate that EoT significantly outperforms strong baselines like Chain-of-Thought prompting and Self-Consistency on complex reasoning tasks involving mathematics, commonsense, and symbolic understanding. The performance gains underscore the value of external insights in enhancing model capabilities. Further analyses reveal the cost-effectiveness, adaptability to diverse models, and importance of heterogeneity for EoT's efficacy. Overall, this work underscores the promise of cross-model communication and collective intelligence for advancing collaborative AI problem solving.
