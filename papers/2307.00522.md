# [LEDITS: Real Image Editing with DDPM Inversion and Semantic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00522)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we combine DDPM inversion and semantic guidance (SEGA) to enable real image editing with enhanced control and flexibility?In particular, the paper explores using DDPM inversion to invert a real image into the latent space of a diffusion model. It then applies semantic guidance concepts during the diffusion process, using the inverted latents, to edit the image. This combined LEDITS approach aims to provide fine-grained control over real image editing by leveraging the capabilities of both DDPM inversion and semantic guidance.The key hypothesis seems to be that this lightweight integration can span a wide range of editing abilities while maintaining advantages like robustness and monotonicity of semantic guidance vectors. The experiments aim to demonstrate the qualitative editing capabilities of LEDITS compared to using just DDPM inversion or semantic guidance alone.In summary, the central research question is how to effectively combine these two techniques for enhanced real image editing, and the hypothesis is that LEDITS will provide improved performance and flexibility compared to each individual method.
