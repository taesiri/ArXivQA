# [Dynamic Adjustment of Matching Radii under the Broadcasting Mode: A   Novel Multitask Learning Strategy and Temporal Modeling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of dynamically adjusting matching radii in ride-hailing systems operating under the broadcasting mode, where drivers have the freedom to choose their preferred orders from a pool broadcast by the platform. Determining optimal radii is crucial but changing spatio-temporal supply/demand characteristics make this a complex problem. Excessively small or large radii can negatively impact system performance metrics like order fulfillment rate, revenue and pickup distances. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Dynamic Broadcasting Radii Adjustment System (DBRAS) with two key components:

1) A Transformer-Encoder-Based (TEB) temporal model that encodes historical data to predict future values of performance metrics under different radii selections. This allows selecting the radius that optimizes the metrics.

2) A Weighted Exponential Smoothing Multi-Task (WESM) learning strategy that trains the TEB model to predict multiple metrics simultaneously. It dynamically adjusts task weights during training based on historical losses to improve convergence and accuracy.

Key Contributions:

a) First predict-then-optimize framework integrated with deep learning to dynamically adjust matching radii in broadcasting-mode ride-hailing systems for overall performance optimization.

b) Novel WESM multi-task learning strategy to balance tradeoffs between optimizing multiple system performance metrics by allowing dynamic weight adjustments for tasks during training.

c) Extensive experiments using a tailored broadcasting mode simulation platform demonstrating effectiveness of proposed techniques. The predict-then-optimize approach increases platform revenue by 7.55% and order fulfillment rate by 13% compared to benchmarks.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in dynamically optimizing the broadcasting mode in ride-hailing by developing an innovative predict-then-optimize framework and devising an effective multi-task learning strategy. Both theoretical and practical implications are demonstrated through thorough experimentation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a Transformer-based model to dynamically adjust matching radii in ride-hailing systems operating under the broadcasting mode, aiming to simultaneously optimize multiple performance metrics including order fulfillment rate, revenue, driver utilization rate, and pickup distance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(a) It makes the first attempt to develop a predict-then-optimize framework integrated with deep learning approaches to dynamically adjust matching radius for system performance optimization in ride-hailing systems with the broadcasting mode. 

(b) It develops a novel multi-task training strategy to balance the tradeoff among the optimization for various system performance metrics in ride-hailing systems, including order fulfillment rate, driver utilization rate, average pickup distance, and platform revenue. The multi-task learning training strategy is shown to be effective in attaining much faster convergence speed and converging to a lower loss.

(c) It has conducted extensive experiments based on a tailored simulation platform for the broadcasting mode operations, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed predict-then-optimize approach and multi-task training strategies.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel predict-then-optimize framework with a multi-task learning strategy to dynamically adjust matching radii in ride-hailing systems operating under the broadcasting mode, in order to optimize multiple system performance metrics. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulations.

The paper focuses on dynamically adjusting the matching radius in ride-hailing systems operating under the broadcasting mode, where orders are broadcast to drivers who can choose to accept them. It proposes a predict-then-optimize framework that uses a Transformer-based temporal model and a multi-task learning strategy to predict key performance metrics under different matching radii. This enables selection of the radius that optimizes the metrics. The methods are evaluated in a tailored simulation environment.
