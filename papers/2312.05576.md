# [Dynamic Adjustment of Matching Radii under the Broadcasting Mode: A   Novel Multitask Learning Strategy and Temporal Modeling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of dynamically adjusting matching radii in ride-hailing systems operating under the broadcasting mode, where drivers have the freedom to choose their preferred orders from a pool broadcast by the platform. Determining optimal radii is crucial but changing spatio-temporal supply/demand characteristics make this a complex problem. Excessively small or large radii can negatively impact system performance metrics like order fulfillment rate, revenue and pickup distances. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Dynamic Broadcasting Radii Adjustment System (DBRAS) with two key components:

1) A Transformer-Encoder-Based (TEB) temporal model that encodes historical data to predict future values of performance metrics under different radii selections. This allows selecting the radius that optimizes the metrics.

2) A Weighted Exponential Smoothing Multi-Task (WESM) learning strategy that trains the TEB model to predict multiple metrics simultaneously. It dynamically adjusts task weights during training based on historical losses to improve convergence and accuracy.

Key Contributions:

a) First predict-then-optimize framework integrated with deep learning to dynamically adjust matching radii in broadcasting-mode ride-hailing systems for overall performance optimization.

b) Novel WESM multi-task learning strategy to balance tradeoffs between optimizing multiple system performance metrics by allowing dynamic weight adjustments for tasks during training.

c) Extensive experiments using a tailored broadcasting mode simulation platform demonstrating effectiveness of proposed techniques. The predict-then-optimize approach increases platform revenue by 7.55% and order fulfillment rate by 13% compared to benchmarks.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in dynamically optimizing the broadcasting mode in ride-hailing by developing an innovative predict-then-optimize framework and devising an effective multi-task learning strategy. Both theoretical and practical implications are demonstrated through thorough experimentation.
