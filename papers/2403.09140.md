## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Sculpt3D: Multi-View Consistent Text-to-3D Generation with Sparse 3D Prior":

Problem:
Recent works on text-to-3D generation using 2D diffusion models as supervision tend to produce results with inconsistent appearances across views (e.g. faces on the back) and inaccurate shapes (e.g. animals with extra legs). Existing methods address this by retraining diffusion models on 3D rendered images, but struggle to balance 2D image quality and 3D consistency.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper presents Sculpt3D, a new framework that injects explicit 3D shape and appearance priors from retrieved 3D templates to enhance text-to-3D generation without retraining the 2D diffusion model. It has two main components:

1) 3D and 2D Co-Supervised Shape Learning: Uses a sparse set of 3D keypoints with binary cross entropy loss to provide rough shape guidance while allowing the 2D diffusion model freedom for creative shape generation. Handles conflicts via creative point growth and pruning guided by diffusion model confidence.

2) 3D Appearance Modulated 2D Diffusion: Uses a lightweight adapter to first adapt the template's style to match the generated object, then uses that adapted template to modulate the diffusion process and align generated appearances to correct viewpoint-specific patterns without limiting overall structure.

Main Contributions:
- Enables explicitly incorporating 3D shape and appearance priors to enhance text-to-3D generation while retaining 2D diffusion model capabilities 
- Introduces creative point growth/pruning for adaptive shape learning from templates
- Uses template appearance patterns to resolve viewpoint-specific appearance inconsistencies
- Demonstrates improved multi-view consistency while maintaining diversity and fidelity

The method achieves significantly higher multi-view consistency rates than baselines while improving quality and alignment metrics on text-to-3D benchmarks.
