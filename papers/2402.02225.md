# [Rethinking the Starting Point: Enhancing Performance and Fairness of   Federated Learning via Collaborative Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing federated learning (FL) methods assume training begins from a randomly initialized model. However, recent works have shown that leveraging a pre-trained model as initialization can improve FL performance. But centralized pre-training introduces biases and substantial performance variance across clients in downstream FL tasks due to inability to mimic heterogeneous data. This causes fairness issues among clients. The paper aims to develop a pre-training strategy tailored to FL that enhances performance without compromising fairness by handling unseen data/tasks in downstream FL.

Proposed Solution - CoPreFL:
The paper proposes a collaborative FL-based pre-training approach called CoPreFL. The key ideas are:

1) Pre-train in a federated manner by distributing data across clients and server to mimic downstream FL tasks. Two scenarios are explored: (i) only clients have data (ii) server also holds a portion of data.

2) Employ a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) approach to enable adaptation to unseen distributions via meta-updates on query sets. This handles unseen data/tasks in downstream FL.

3) Encode balance between performance and fairness into the meta-loss to strike a tradeoff instead of solely optimizing for accuracy. This addresses fairness concerns in downstream FL.


Main Contributions:

1) Systematically examine pre-training for FL by relaxing assumption that all data must be centrally stored. Develop viable pre-training approach for hybrid client-server data storage settings.

2) Novel meta-learning scheme to mimic heterogeneity and dynamics of distributed downstream scenarios. Optimize pre-trained model for both accuracy and fairness via query sets.

3) Extensive experiments validating CoPreFL provides robust initialization for unseen downstream FL tasks. Results show enhanced average performance and more equitable predictions across clients.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in tailoring pre-training specifically for federated learning set-ups by handling unseen data/tasks and enhancing fairness. The proposed collaborative pre-training technique CoPreFL consistently outperforms existing approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a collaborative pre-training approach for federated learning using meta-learning to provide a robust model initialization that enhances both performance and fairness across clients in downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a collaborative pre-training approach called CoPreFL for federated learning (FL) that provides a robust model initialization for downstream FL tasks. Specifically, the key innovations include:

1) Developing a federated learning based pre-training method that handles two practical scenarios - where data is only available at distributed clients, and where the server also possesses a portion of data. 

2) Proposing a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) approach during pre-training to enable adaptation of the pre-trained model to new distributions not seen during pre-training. This allows the model to generalize better to unfamiliar classes or data in downstream tasks.

3) Encoding a balance between performance and fairness into the pre-training optimization objective, instead of just maximizing performance. This results in pre-trained models that achieve higher accuracy in downstream tasks while also ensuring more equitable predictions across clients.

Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that their proposed pre-training methodology CoPreFL consistently provides significant improvements in both accuracy and fairness over state-of-the-art approaches when applied to various downstream federated learning tasks. The design of CoPreFL specifically caters to challenges like data heterogeneity, unseen data distributions, and performance variance that are commonly faced in practical federated learning deployments.
