# [The SVHN Dataset Is Deceptive for Probabilistic Generative Models Due to   a Distribution Mismatch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper investigates an issue with the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset when used as a benchmark for probabilistic generative models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion models. 
- Specifically, they find a distribution mismatch between the training set and test set in SVHN, meaning the two splits are not drawn from the same underlying data distribution.
- This mismatch does not impact classification tasks, which is why it hasn't been previously detected. But it does affect the evaluation of generative models that explicitly model the data distribution.

Proposed Solution
- They first define and empirically demonstrate the distribution mismatch using metrics like Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) between random splits of training and test data.
- As a solution, they remix the official SVHN training and test sets to create "SVHN-Remix", matching their distributions.
- Experiments with VAEs and diffusion models on SVHN-Remix show it restores the test likelihood as an informative metric for evaluating generative models.

Key Contributions
- Identifying an under-recognized issue with using SVHN as a benchmark dataset for probabilistic generative models
- Providing strong empirical evidence of a distribution mismatch between SVHN's training and test sets
- Proposing and validating a new split "SVHN-Remix" that resolves this mismatch, enabling proper generative model evaluation
- Warning ML practitioners that benchmark dataset splits may not always match distributions, especially for generative modeling tasks

The paper makes an important contribution in detecting this distribution shift issue in the widely used SVHN dataset. Their proposed SVHN-Remix split should be adopted as the standard going forward when evaluating generative models on SVHN.
