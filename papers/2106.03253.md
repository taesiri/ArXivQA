# [Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:1) Do recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data actually outperform traditional tree-based models like XGBoost when evaluated across diverse datasets? 2) How do these deep learning models for tabular data compare to XGBoost in terms of performance, computational efficiency, and ease of hyperparameter tuning?The central hypothesis appears to be that despite claims in some previous papers, deep learning models do not consistently surpass XGBoost for tabular data learning across different datasets. The authors systematically test this hypothesis by evaluating several recent deep learning models against XGBoost on a diverse set of 11 classification and regression datasets.In summary, the key research questions focus on rigorously benchmarking deep learning versus traditional methods for tabular data, in order to provide clearer conclusions about their relative strengths and weaknesses that can help guide future research and applications. The authors hypothesize that deep learning may not be better than gradient boosted decision trees despite some claims, and they test this hypothesis through extensive experiments.
