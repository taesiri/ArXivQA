# [Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:

1) Do recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data actually outperform traditional tree-based models like XGBoost when evaluated across diverse datasets? 

2) How do these deep learning models for tabular data compare to XGBoost in terms of performance, computational efficiency, and ease of hyperparameter tuning?

The central hypothesis appears to be that despite claims in some previous papers, deep learning models do not consistently surpass XGBoost for tabular data learning across different datasets. The authors systematically test this hypothesis by evaluating several recent deep learning models against XGBoost on a diverse set of 11 classification and regression datasets.

In summary, the key research questions focus on rigorously benchmarking deep learning versus traditional methods for tabular data, in order to provide clearer conclusions about their relative strengths and weaknesses that can help guide future research and applications. The authors hypothesize that deep learning may not be better than gradient boosted decision trees despite some claims, and they test this hypothesis through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a systematic comparison of recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data against traditional tree-based models, specifically XGBoost. The key findings and contributions are:

- The deep models (TabNet, NODE, DNF-Net) tend to perform best on the datasets they were originally tested on in their papers, but their performance significantly deteriorates on other datasets. In contrast, XGBoost generalizes better across different tabular datasets. 

- XGBoost overall outperforms the deep models on the datasets tested, indicating tree ensembles are still state-of-the-art for tabular data. 

- However, an ensemble of XGBoost and deep models performs better than XGBoost alone. This shows both types of models have complementary strengths.

- XGBoost requires much less hyperparameter tuning compared to the deep models. It reaches good performance with fewer optimization iterations.

- The results indicate deep learning has made progress on tabular data but still does not surpass tree ensembles like XGBoost, despite some claims in recent papers. More research is needed to develop deep models that generalize as well across diverse tabular datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous benchmarking of recent deep learning models for tabular data, providing a clearer picture of their capabilities and limitations compared to traditional methods like XGBoost. The findings highlight open challenges in this area.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related research:

- The paper focuses on evaluating recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data, including TabNet, NODE, DNF-Net, and 1D-CNN. This directly compares and benchmarks these newer models, which addresses a need since previous papers have evaluated them separately on different datasets. 

- It compares the deep learning models to a strong baseline of XGBoost, which is commonly used for tabular data. Showing comparisons to a proven model provides useful context on whether the deep learning methods offer clear improvements.

- The study uses a diverse set of 11 tabular datasets, including some used in the original papers of the models and some new ones. Evaluating generalization to unseen datasets provides a more rigorous test of the models.

- The experiments go beyond just accuracy comparisons and also examine optimization/tuning time, model ensembles, and tradeoffs like computational cost. These additional analyses give a more comprehensive view of real-world usage.

- The finding that deep models tend to underperform XGBoost on many tabular datasets is consistent with some other recent papers. However, showing improved performance with model ensembles is a useful contribution.

Overall, I see this as a thorough benchmarking study that synthesizes results across recent deep learning research on tabular data. The model comparisons on diverse datasets and the additional analyses around optimization and ensembles help advance understanding of applying deep learning in this domain. The results highlight remaining challenges but also opportunities for improvements via ensembling.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing new deep learning models for tabular data that are easier to optimize and can better compete with XGBoost in terms of optimization time and robustness. The authors found XGBoost was much faster and easier to optimize than the deep learning models.

- Exploring ways to improve the ensemble of XGBoost and deep models. The ensemble performed the best in the authors' experiments, so further improving this ensemble is one direction.

- Performing more systematic evaluation of deep learning models on diverse tabular datasets, not just the datasets used in the paper proposing the model. The authors found performance declined on other datasets.

- Considering computational efficiency and optimization time more critically when developing and comparing models, not just accuracy. This is important for real-world usage.

- Developing better hyperparameter optimization techniques or default hyperparameters for deep learning on tabular data to reduce the optimization difficulty.

- Further analysis of why deep learning models seem to overfit more to their original datasets compared to XGBoost and ensemble models.

- Exploring why combining XGBoost and deep models improves performance - is it because they make different types of errors? Analysis of the errors could be insightful.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving deep learning and ensembles for tabular data, faster optimization, more robust evaluation on diverse data, and analysis to provide insights into the models' limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper compares recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data (TabNet, NODE, DNF-Net, 1D-CNN) against the traditional gradient boosting model XGBoost. The authors find that each deep model performs best on the datasets used in its original paper, but worse on other datasets. In contrast, XGBoost generally outperforms the deep models across datasets. However, an ensemble of the deep models and XGBoost achieves better performance than XGBoost alone. The authors conclude that deep models have made progress on tabular data but do not surpass XGBoost, and that further research is needed.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data and finds that they do not outperform gradient boosted decision trees like XGBoost on a variety of datasets, but an ensemble approach combining deep models with XGBoost provides the best performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores whether recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data should be recommended over traditional tree-based models like XGBoost. The authors evaluate four recent deep learning models (TabNet, NODE, DNF-Net, 1D-CNN) and compare them to XGBoost on 11 diverse tabular datasets. The deep learning models tend to perform best on the specific datasets they were originally tested on in their papers, but worse on other datasets. XGBoost consistently outperforms the deep learning models across the board. However, an ensemble combining XGBoost with the deep learning models performs better than XGBoost alone. 

In conclusion, the authors find that deep learning has not yet surpassed tree-based methods like XGBoost for tabular data, despite recent progress. The deep learning models are more sensitive to the specific dataset and require more hyperparameter tuning than XGBoost. The authors suggest that deep learning for tabular data is still an open research area. Their results indicate combining deep learning and traditional methods like XGBoost in ensembles may be a promising direction. But more work is needed to develop deep learning models that can compete with XGBoost in terms of performance, efficiency, and ease of tuning across diverse tabular datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper compares recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data (TabNet, NODE, DNF-Net, 1D-CNN) to the commonly used XGBoost model. The authors train and evaluate these models on 11 diverse tabular datasets, including datasets used in the original papers proposing the models as well as new datasets. To make a fair comparison, a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization method is used to tune each model, with all models optimized for the same number of steps. The performance metric (RMSE or cross-entropy loss) on a held-out test set is reported after selecting the best hyperparameters on a validation set. The authors find that XGBoost generally outperforms the deep models, especially on datasets not used in the papers originally proposing the deep models. However, an ensemble of all the models together performs better than any individual model. The difficulty of hyperparameter tuning is also analyzed by looking at the optimization convergence, with XGBoost converging faster than the deep models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is exploring whether recently proposed deep learning models for tabular data should be recommended over traditional methods like XGBoost. There has been some claims that these new deep models outperform XGBoost, but the evidence is unclear. 

- The main questions addressed are:
   - Do the deep models actually generalize well and outperform XGBoost on diverse tabular datasets beyond those used in the papers where the models were proposed?
   - How do the deep models compare to XGBoost in terms of computational efficiency and ease of hyperparameter tuning?

- The paper tests 4 recent deep learning models (TabNet, NODE, DNF-Net, 1D-CNN) against XGBoost on 11 diverse tabular classification and regression datasets.

- The results show that the deep models tend to perform worse on datasets not used in their original papers, while XGBoost is more robust across datasets. XGBoost also requires less hyperparameter tuning. 

- However, an ensemble of XGBoost + deep models does outperform XGBoost alone on most datasets.

- The conclusions are that deep learning is not yet superior to XGBoost on tabular data based on current evidence, but an ensemble approach combining deep models and XGBoost shows promise. More research is still needed in this area.

In summary, the key questions addressed are whether deep learning models live up to claims about outperforming XGBoost on tabular data, and how they compare in terms of computational efficiency and ease of use. The paper provides useful evidence that XGBoost remains superior on its own based on the datasets tested.
