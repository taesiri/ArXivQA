# [Unsupervised Distance Metric Learning for Anomaly Detection Over   Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Anomaly detection for multivariate time series (MTS) is challenging due to complex correlations and dependencies among dimensions. 
- Existing methods either have limitations such as being supervised or poor performance compared to complex deep learning methods. There is a lack of unsupervised methods, especially ones using distance-based approaches, which have inherent advantages.  
- The commonly used Euclidean distance metric is sensitive to noise when applied to anomaly detection using approaches like nearest neighbors and clustering. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is more robust but has not been adapted for multivariate unsupervised anomaly detection.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an unsupervised distance metric learning approach called FCM-wDTW, which enhances fuzzy c-means clustering with a locally weighted DTW. 
- Cluster centers found by FCM-wDTW represent normal patterns and relationships between dimensions. An efficient optimization algorithm involving alternating updates of cluster assignments, time warping paths, feature weights and cluster centers is developed.
- Based on learned feature weights and cluster centers, anomalies are detected using reconstruction error, i.e. difference between original sample and reconstruction from the latent space. Samples far from clusters have higher reconstruction error.

Main Contributions:
- Improve fuzzy c-means clustering for multivariate time series by integrating weighted DTW, which helps reveal normal correlations between dimensions.
- Develop an efficient optimization algorithm to learn optimal cluster centers, time warping paths between samples, feature dimension weights and membership matrix.
- Propose using the learned models for anomaly detection via sample reconstruction method and scoring based on reconstruction error.
- Evaluation using real-world multivariate time series datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to 11 benchmark methods.

In summary, the paper presents a novel unsupervised anomaly detection technique using distance metric learning for multivariate time series. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency.
