# [Masked prediction tasks: a parameter identifiability view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09305)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is whether masked prediction tasks are sufficient for identifying the parameters in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs (G-HMMs). 

Specifically, the paper considers prediction tasks where some tokens are masked out, and aims to understand whether predicting the masked tokens conditioned on the observed tokens enables parameter recovery. The authors prove theorems characterizing which prediction tasks allow identifiability of the model parameters under certain assumptions, and which tasks fail to provide identifiability.

The main findings are:

- For HMMs, predicting one token given another (i.e. pairwise prediction) is not sufficient for parameter identifiability. However, predicting two tokens jointly conditioned on a third token does allow identifiability.

- For G-HMMs, predicting one token given another is sufficient for parameter identifiability. This highlights a key difference from HMMs in terms of the prediction tasks needed for identifiability.

- For both HMMs and G-HMMs, predicting multiple pairs of tokens is still insufficient, while a prediction task involving three tokens (counting both conditioned and predicted tokens) is sufficient.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that masked prediction tasks can enable parameter identifiability for HMMs and G-HMMs, and the key question addressed is characterizing which specific tasks are sufficient or insufficient for this purpose. The results delineate the importance of the parametric form of the optimal predictors associated with different prediction tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents theoretical results on the identifiability of parameters in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs (G-HMMs) from masked prediction tasks. The key contributions are:

1. It shows that predicting one token given another (pairwise prediction) is insufficient to identify parameters of discrete HMMs, but does suffice for G-HMMs. 

2. For discrete HMMs, predicting two tokens jointly conditioned on a third token is sufficient for parameter identifiability. Similarly for G-HMMs, predicting two tokens jointly conditioned on a third, or predicting three tokens with temporal adjacency, enables parameter identifiability.

3. The results highlight the importance of the specific form of the predictors in determining identifiability. For instance, while pairwise marginals contain enough information for identifiability in both models, the predictors based on conditional expectations can be too weak to extract this information fully.

4. The proofs rely on constructing a 3-tensor from the conditional 2-tensor outputs of the predictors, to which tensor decomposition uniqueness results can be applied. This reduces the question of identifiability from masked prediction to the uniqueness of the tensor decomposition.

5. The results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the successes and limitations of masked prediction as a self-supervised learning method on sequential data. The theory suggests particular task configurations that are more suitable for parameter recovery.

In summary, the key contribution is a theoretical characterization of when masked prediction objectives can provably recover the parameters of latent variable sequential models like HMMs and G-HMMs. This provides a principled basis for designing effective self-supervised learning schemes based on masked prediction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper shows the algebraic identifiability of hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally-Gaussian HMMs from masked prediction tasks that predict a subset of tokens conditioned on others, proving when and how the parameters can be uniquely recovered up to equivalence classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how the paper compares to other research in the field of self-supervised learning:

The key contribution of this paper is using a parameter recovery lens to study masked prediction tasks, which is novel compared to prior work. Most prior theoretical analyses of self-supervised learning focus on characterizing the quality of learned features/representations, rather than parameter recovery. For example, works like Arora et al. (2019), Saunshi et al. (2020), Wei et al. (2021) analyze contrastive methods and masked language models through the lens of feature quality. In contrast, this paper provides identifiability results on whether model parameters can be recovered from different prediction tasks.

The most related prior work is by Anandkumar et al. (2012, 2014) which shows tensor decomposition methods can identify latent variable model parameters like HMMs from third order moments. The difference is that this paper considers identifiability from conditional moments given by the predictors for masked tokens, rather than full joint moments. This allows identifiability from lower order moments in some cases, but also introduces new technical challenges.

Overall, the parameter recovery viewpoint and analysis of masked prediction is novel. While Zhao et al. (2020) briefly argue some parameter aspects are learned in their setup, this work provides a dedicated study on identifiability through masked prediction. The approach of relating these tasks to tensor decomposition is also not employed in prior work. Thus, this paper carves out a unique direction for theoretically analyzing self-supervised learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

1. Extending the analysis to more general families of HMMs beyond the basic setup considered here. For example, studying identifiability for richer parameterizations like using full covariance Gaussians rather than just spherical. Or considering more complex discrete emission distributions beyond categorical.

2. Deriving sample complexity bounds for parameter estimation. The current work focuses on identifiability but does not provide algorithms or sample complexity analyses. An interesting direction is to adapt existing tensor decomposition algorithms and analyze their sample complexities for learning the parameters. 

3. Studying the robustness properties of different prediction tasks. The identifiability results suggest certain tasks are better than others, but it is unclear if some tasks may be more robust to model misspecification or noise in the data. Investigating the robustness of different prediction tasks is important for practical applications.

4. Considering identifiability for other self-supervised objectives beyond masked prediction. The paper focuses specifically on predicting masked tokens, but many other self-supervised objectives have been proposed like contrastive learning, image rotation prediction, etc. Analyzing these other objectives through the lens of parameter identifiability is an interesting direction.

5. Extending the theoretical analysis to more complex self-supervised learning settings like images or natural language. The simplistic HMM setup allows crisp theoretical results, but applying similar analyses to real-world domains is important future work.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: analyzing more general model classes, deriving sample complexity bounds, evaluating robustness of different tasks, studying other self-supervised objectives, and extending the theory to more complex domains like vision and language.
