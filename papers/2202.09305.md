# [Masked prediction tasks: a parameter identifiability view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09305)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is whether masked prediction tasks are sufficient for identifying the parameters in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs (G-HMMs). 

Specifically, the paper considers prediction tasks where some tokens are masked out, and aims to understand whether predicting the masked tokens conditioned on the observed tokens enables parameter recovery. The authors prove theorems characterizing which prediction tasks allow identifiability of the model parameters under certain assumptions, and which tasks fail to provide identifiability.

The main findings are:

- For HMMs, predicting one token given another (i.e. pairwise prediction) is not sufficient for parameter identifiability. However, predicting two tokens jointly conditioned on a third token does allow identifiability.

- For G-HMMs, predicting one token given another is sufficient for parameter identifiability. This highlights a key difference from HMMs in terms of the prediction tasks needed for identifiability.

- For both HMMs and G-HMMs, predicting multiple pairs of tokens is still insufficient, while a prediction task involving three tokens (counting both conditioned and predicted tokens) is sufficient.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that masked prediction tasks can enable parameter identifiability for HMMs and G-HMMs, and the key question addressed is characterizing which specific tasks are sufficient or insufficient for this purpose. The results delineate the importance of the parametric form of the optimal predictors associated with different prediction tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents theoretical results on the identifiability of parameters in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs (G-HMMs) from masked prediction tasks. The key contributions are:

1. It shows that predicting one token given another (pairwise prediction) is insufficient to identify parameters of discrete HMMs, but does suffice for G-HMMs. 

2. For discrete HMMs, predicting two tokens jointly conditioned on a third token is sufficient for parameter identifiability. Similarly for G-HMMs, predicting two tokens jointly conditioned on a third, or predicting three tokens with temporal adjacency, enables parameter identifiability.

3. The results highlight the importance of the specific form of the predictors in determining identifiability. For instance, while pairwise marginals contain enough information for identifiability in both models, the predictors based on conditional expectations can be too weak to extract this information fully.

4. The proofs rely on constructing a 3-tensor from the conditional 2-tensor outputs of the predictors, to which tensor decomposition uniqueness results can be applied. This reduces the question of identifiability from masked prediction to the uniqueness of the tensor decomposition.

5. The results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the successes and limitations of masked prediction as a self-supervised learning method on sequential data. The theory suggests particular task configurations that are more suitable for parameter recovery.

In summary, the key contribution is a theoretical characterization of when masked prediction objectives can provably recover the parameters of latent variable sequential models like HMMs and G-HMMs. This provides a principled basis for designing effective self-supervised learning schemes based on masked prediction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper shows the algebraic identifiability of hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally-Gaussian HMMs from masked prediction tasks that predict a subset of tokens conditioned on others, proving when and how the parameters can be uniquely recovered up to equivalence classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how the paper compares to other research in the field of self-supervised learning:

The key contribution of this paper is using a parameter recovery lens to study masked prediction tasks, which is novel compared to prior work. Most prior theoretical analyses of self-supervised learning focus on characterizing the quality of learned features/representations, rather than parameter recovery. For example, works like Arora et al. (2019), Saunshi et al. (2020), Wei et al. (2021) analyze contrastive methods and masked language models through the lens of feature quality. In contrast, this paper provides identifiability results on whether model parameters can be recovered from different prediction tasks.

The most related prior work is by Anandkumar et al. (2012, 2014) which shows tensor decomposition methods can identify latent variable model parameters like HMMs from third order moments. The difference is that this paper considers identifiability from conditional moments given by the predictors for masked tokens, rather than full joint moments. This allows identifiability from lower order moments in some cases, but also introduces new technical challenges.

Overall, the parameter recovery viewpoint and analysis of masked prediction is novel. While Zhao et al. (2020) briefly argue some parameter aspects are learned in their setup, this work provides a dedicated study on identifiability through masked prediction. The approach of relating these tasks to tensor decomposition is also not employed in prior work. Thus, this paper carves out a unique direction for theoretically analyzing self-supervised learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

1. Extending the analysis to more general families of HMMs beyond the basic setup considered here. For example, studying identifiability for richer parameterizations like using full covariance Gaussians rather than just spherical. Or considering more complex discrete emission distributions beyond categorical.

2. Deriving sample complexity bounds for parameter estimation. The current work focuses on identifiability but does not provide algorithms or sample complexity analyses. An interesting direction is to adapt existing tensor decomposition algorithms and analyze their sample complexities for learning the parameters. 

3. Studying the robustness properties of different prediction tasks. The identifiability results suggest certain tasks are better than others, but it is unclear if some tasks may be more robust to model misspecification or noise in the data. Investigating the robustness of different prediction tasks is important for practical applications.

4. Considering identifiability for other self-supervised objectives beyond masked prediction. The paper focuses specifically on predicting masked tokens, but many other self-supervised objectives have been proposed like contrastive learning, image rotation prediction, etc. Analyzing these other objectives through the lens of parameter identifiability is an interesting direction.

5. Extending the theoretical analysis to more complex self-supervised learning settings like images or natural language. The simplistic HMM setup allows crisp theoretical results, but applying similar analyses to real-world domains is important future work.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: analyzing more general model classes, deriving sample complexity bounds, evaluating robustness of different tasks, studying other self-supervised objectives, and extending the theory to more complex domains like vision and language.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs (G-HMMs). It studies the identifiability of model parameters from predicting masked tokens, showing that pairwise prediction fails for HMMs but a single pairwise task suffices for G-HMMs. For both models, predicting two masked tokens conditioned on a third observable token enables parameter identifiability. The key proof technique is constructing a third-order tensor from the predictors whose uniqueness guarantees identifiability via classic results on tensor decomposition. Overall, the work provides a theoretical characterization of how the choice of prediction task and model class impacts identifiability of latent variable models under the masked prediction self-supervision paradigm. It highlights the importance of the specific functional form of the predictors, in addition to the order of statistical moments they match, for enabling parameter recovery.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new self-supervised learning approach for hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on masked prediction tasks. HMMs are generative probabilistic models commonly used for modeling sequential data. Self-supervised learning aims to learn useful representations from unlabeled data by defining pretext tasks that involve predicting missing or corrupted parts of the data. This work studies the identifiability of HMM parameters from different masked prediction tasks. Specifically, it analyzes predicting one token given another (pairwise prediction) and predicting two tokens given a third (triplet prediction). 

The main results show that pairwise prediction is not sufficient for identifiability with discrete HMMs but is identifiable for conditionally Gaussian HMMs under certain assumptions. However, triplet prediction tasks provably enable parameter identifiability for both discrete and conditionally Gaussian HMMs. The identifiability proofs rely on tensor decomposition techniques. Overall, the analyses characterize how the choice of masked prediction task impacts the ability to recover model parameters. The results suggest triplet prediction is a promising approach for self-supervised learning with HMMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "All You Need is a Good Functional Prior for Bayesian Deep Learning":

The paper proposes a new functional variational Bayesian method for deep neural networks. The key idea is to impose a Gaussian process (GP) prior over the function space represented by a deep neural network. This induces correlations between the weights of the network in a way that reflects the smoothness properties of the function being learned. Learning then involves posterior inference over the weights by approximating the true posterior with a variational distribution. The specific variational family used is also motivated by the GP view, leading to an inference method that explicitly captures uncertainty while preserving the representation power and scalability of standard deep learning. The main theoretical contribution is showing that by using particular types of spectral frequency kernels for the GP prior, the resulting method enjoys good generalization guarantees. Empirically, the proposed Bayesian deep learning approach achieves strong performance on image classification benchmarks while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of understanding when self-supervised learning with masked prediction tasks can recover the parameters of latent variable models. Specifically, it focuses on hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs, and aims to characterize which prediction tasks enable parameter identifiability in these models. 

The key questions the paper seeks to address are:

- Can we recover the parameters of an HMM or conditionally Gaussian HMM using only masked prediction tasks, without access to the true generative process? 

- How does the choice of prediction task affect parameter identifiability? For example, does predicting one token vs multiple tokens make a difference? Does the order of conditioned vs predicted tokens matter?

- What are necessary and/or sufficient conditions on the prediction task for parameter identifiability?

The motivation is to gain theoretical understanding of when self-supervised learning can work for unsupervised representation learning. While masked prediction has shown empirical success, e.g. in models like BERT, the theoretical conditions for its effectiveness are not well understood. This work provides an initial step toward characterizing such conditions in common latent variable models like HMMs.

In summary, the key problems are understanding if and when masked prediction allows parameter recovery in latent variable models, as a way to shed light on the theoretical underpinnings of self-supervised representation learning. The paper makes progress on this by studying HMMs and conditional Gaussian HMMs under different prediction tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Hidden Markov model (HMM) - A statistical model where a sequence of observable output variables depends on an underlying sequence of unobservable (hidden) states. HMMs are commonly used for probabilistic sequence modeling.

- Gaussian hidden Markov model (G-HMM) - A type of HMM where the output variables are continuous and modeled as Gaussian distributed, conditioned on the hidden state.

- Masked prediction - A self-supervised learning approach where parts of a sequence are masked out, and a model is trained to predict the masked tokens.

- Parameter recovery - Recovering or identifying the true parameters of a generative model from observed data or specific learning objectives. 

- Identifiability - Whether the parameters of a model can be uniquely recovered given observed data.

- Tensor methods - Using tensor (multi-way array) decompositions to recover latent variable model parameters, based on insights from works like Kruskal's theorem on uniqueness of low-rank tensor decompositions.

- Pairwise prediction - Predicting one token given another token, a simple form of masked prediction.

- Adjacent time steps - Tokens at neighboring sequence positions, important in some identifiability results.

- Conditional expectation vs. distribution - Differences in identifiability between having access to just the conditional expectation of masked tokens, versus the full conditional distribution.

So in summary, key ideas are around studying masked prediction objectives for parameter recovery in HMMs, with a focus on identifiability results using tensor methods.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the problem of parameter identifiability in self-supervised learning through the lens of masked prediction tasks. The authors consider data generated from parametric probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs (cHMMs). The goal is to understand when the parameters of the optimal masked predictors, when suitably parameterized, can recover the ground truth parameters of the data model. They show that for HMMs, pairwise prediction tasks like predicting $x_2$ from $x_1$ are not identifiable. However, predicting tensor products like $x_2 \otimes x_3$ given $x_1$ does lead to identifiability by constructing a 3-tensor from the predictors whose rank-1 components are unique. For cHMMs, even pairwise prediction suffices owing to the specific parametric form of the posterior distribution. More broadly, the results demonstrate that identifiability is highly dependent on the interaction between the prediction task, the predictor parametrization, and the data model. The proofs leverage tools from tensor decomposition like Kruskal's theorem. The authors argue that these theoretical findings could inform practical self-supervised learning, and suggest many interesting open questions around prediction tasks, sample complexity, and model classes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper "Masked prediction tasks: a parameter identifiability view" studies identifiability of the parameters of latent variable sequence models from masked prediction tasks used in self-supervised learning. Specifically, it shows that for Hidden Markov Models and conditionally Gaussian Hidden Markov Models, certain prediction tasks like predicting multiple masked tokens can provably recover model parameters under assumptions, while other tasks like pairwise prediction may not. The results connect self-supervised learning to tensor decomposition techniques and highlight that identifiability is very sensitive to the precise prediction task.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies self-supervised learning through the lens of parameter identifiability, focusing on predicting masked tokens from sequential data generated by hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally Gaussian HMMs. It shows that whether a particular masked prediction task yields parameter identifiability depends intricately on the interaction between the prediction task and the data generative model. For instance, predicting one token from another cannot recover HMM parameters, but can identify conditionally Gaussian HMM parameters due to differences in the parametric form of the optimal predictor. The paper leverages tools from tensor decomposition theory to prove identifiability from predicting multiple tokens, showing a connection between uniqueness of tensor rank decompositions and self-supervised learning. Overall, the results demonstrate a rich landscape of possibilities regarding when self-supervised learning yields parameter identifiability, highlighting the importance of the prediction task structure and potentially informing best practices. The work opens up many directions for future work to further understand self-supervised learning through the lens of parameter recovery.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using masked prediction tasks for self-supervised learning through the lens of parameter identifiability. How does framing the problem as one of parameter identifiability for a generative model differ from the standard approach of evaluating self-supervised learning methods based on downstream performance? What are the tradeoffs between these perspectives?

2.
