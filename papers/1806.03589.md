# [Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03589)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop an improved image inpainting method that can handle free-form masks and user guidance, while generating high-quality and realistic image completions?

The key points related to this question seem to be:

- Standard convolutional neural networks are not well-suited for image inpainting tasks with free-form masks, due to treating all pixels equally. 

- Partial convolutions improve on this by masking out invalid pixels, but have limitations due to heuristic mask updating rules.

- The proposed gated convolutions learn a dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel and location, improving results for free-form masks and user guidance.

- Existing GAN losses have difficulties with free-form masks. The proposed SN-PatchGAN loss is tailored for this, being applied locally.

- The overall network architecture integrates gated convolutions and SN-PatchGAN to achieve state-of-the-art free-form inpainting performance.

- An extension to allow user sketch guidance is presented, enabling interactive image editing applications.

So in summary, the main hypothesis appears to be that a model incorporating gated convolutions and SN-PatchGAN will achieve improved performance on free-form image inpainting, both automatically and with user guidance. The paper aims to demonstrate this through model design, training, evaluation, and applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing gated convolution for free-form image inpainting. Gated convolutions learn a dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel and spatial location, which improves results for free-form masks and user guidance input. 

- Introducing the SN-PatchGAN, a simple and effective GAN loss for training free-form image inpainting networks. SN-PatchGAN applies spectral normalization to stabilize GAN training and uses a patch-based hinge loss.

- Presenting an end-to-end neural network for free-form inpainting using gated convolutions and the SN-PatchGAN loss. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

- Extending the inpainting model to allow optional user guidance in the form of sparse sketch. User sketch can help guide the inpainting to produce more desirable results.

- Demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed inpainting system for practical applications like object removal, image editing, and creative image manipulation.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing novel components like gated convolutions and the SN-PatchGAN loss to improve free-form image inpainting, as well as developing an end-to-end deep generative model and demonstrating its capabilities.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a generative image inpainting system using gated convolutions and a patch-based adversarial loss (SN-PatchGAN) to fill in free-form masks and support optional user guidance, achieving higher quality results than previous methods on image datasets like Places2 and CelebA-HQ.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in free-form image inpainting:

- It introduces gated convolution as a new building block for image inpainting networks. This provides a more learnable and flexible feature selection mechanism compared to partial convolutions used in prior work like Liu et al. 

- The proposed SN-PatchGAN loss is simpler and more applicable to free-form masks than previous local+global GAN formulations like Iizuka et al. 

- It supports user-guided inpainting through sketch inputs, enabling more interactive image editing applications. Prior deep learning works have focused more on fully automatic inpainting. 

- Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed approach generates higher quality inpainting results on free-form masks than previous state-of-the-art methods like Iizuka et al. and Liu et al.

- The approach is end-to-end trainable and does not rely on any traditional optimization or blending techniques used in earlier hybrid inpainting methods.

- Compared to Liu et al., this work uses a simpler reconstruction loss and GAN formulation with fewer hyperparameters to balance, while still improving visual quality.

Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in deep learning based free-form inpainting by introducing better network building blocks, loss functions, and interactivity. The comprehensive experiments validate these contributions lead to improved performance and flexibility compared to prior arts. The work helps enable more practical image editing applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Exploring more sophisticated gating mechanisms beyond the simple sigmoid gating used in this work. The authors mention Highway Networks and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks as examples of more advanced gating that could potentially further improve results.

- Extending the gated convolution idea to other tasks beyond image inpainting, such as image segmentation, super-resolution, etc. The authors suggest gated convolution may have benefits for other tasks where certain input regions are invalid or unreliable.

- Enabling video inpainting with gated convolution and extending the ideas to the spatio-temporal domain.

- Further improving the training stability and efficiency of SN-PatchGAN for inpainting. The authors mention this is an active area of GAN research.

- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics for image inpainting tasks, which currently lack good numeric measures of quality.

- Exploring alternative user inputs beyond sketch for guided image inpainting, such as color strokes, text labels, etc. 

- Applying the gated convolution approach to other types of networks beyond the encoder-decoder architecture used in this work.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more advanced gating mechanisms, applying gated convolution to other tasks and network architectures, improving SN-PatchGAN training, creating better evaluation metrics, and exploring new forms of user guidance for image editing.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents a generative image inpainting system for completing images with free-form masks and guidance. The proposed method is based on gated convolutions, which learn a dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel at each spatial location across all layers. This allows the model to handle free-form masks and user guidance input better than vanilla or partial convolutions. The inpainting network uses an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked gated convolutions and a contextual attention module to capture long-range dependencies. For training, the authors propose a SN-PatchGAN loss which applies spectral normalization and hinge loss on dense image patches. This simple loss stabilizes training for free-form masks. 

The inpainting network is extended to allow user sketch guidance by simply conditioning the model on an additional sketch input channel. Results demonstrate the proposed gated convolution system generates higher quality and more flexible inpainting than previous methods on inpainting datasets with free-form masks. The system helps users quickly remove distracting objects, modify image layouts, clear watermarks and edit faces interactively. The simple and effective gated convolutions and SN-PatchGAN improve over limitations of vanilla and partial convolutions for free-form image inpainting tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a generative image inpainting system for free-form image completion and editing. The key component is a gated convolution layer that learns to dynamically select features for each channel and spatial location across all layers. This helps the model handle free-form masks and user guidance input like sketches. The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked gated convolutions. For training stability and quality, the paper presents SN-PatchGAN which applies a spectral-normalized PatchGAN discriminator on dense image patches. This simple loss helps generate high-quality inpainting for free-form masks. The model is trained end-to-end on pixel reconstruction loss and the proposed SN-PatchGAN loss. The paper shows the system can help users quickly remove objects, modify layouts, clear watermarks, edit faces, and create novel objects by providing an optional sketch input.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem it is trying to address is how to do better image inpainting (filling in missing or masked regions of an image) using deep learning methods. Some key issues it discusses:

- Vanilla convolutions used in previous inpainting networks treat all pixels the same, which causes problems when some pixels are valid and others are masked/missing. 

- It proposes a new "gated convolution" layer to learn a dynamic feature selection mechanism to handle valid vs invalid pixels better.

- Existing inpainting methods focused on rectangular mask regions, but the paper wants to do free-form inpainting for arbitrary mask shapes.

- They design a new patch-based GAN loss (SN-PatchGAN) for training on free-form masks.

- They extend the method to allow user-guided inpainting by sketching.

So in summary, the main problem is how to do better free-form inpainting on arbitrary masks/holes, including allowing user guidance. The gated convolutions and SN-PatchGAN are proposed to address weaknesses of previous approaches for this task.
