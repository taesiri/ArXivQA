# [Diffusion Models are Geometry Critics: Single Image 3D Editing Using   Pre-Trained Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11503)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for single-image 3D-aware editing rely on models trained on limited or synthetic datasets, thus lacking generalization to open-domain images. The paper aims to achieve generalized 3D-aware image editing applicable to diverse real-world photos using powerful pre-trained image diffusion models, without additional tuning.  

Method:
The paper proposes a novel iterative algorithm with three key phases:
1) View synthesis: Generates the target view of the selected object using depth-based image warping and layered diffusion inpainting to fill disoccluded regions.
2) Undistortion: Rectifies potential distortions in the target view using an adapted noising-denoising scheme with diffusion models. A noise level parameter controls the extent of changes.
3) Shape alignment: Aligns the shape in the original view to match the undistorted target view by optimizing the depth and minimizing dense correspondences.

These phases iterate with a decreasing noise level, reducing distortions while increasing consistency. The method harnesses diffusion models for dual purposes - providing appearance priors and acting as geometry critics to enhance shape reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- A generalized single-image 3D-aware editing framework exploiting powerful pre-trained diffusion models without additional tuning.
- An iterative depth-assisted algorithm that leverages diffusion models' inherent geometric knowledge to synthesize novel views and iteratively refine them.
- State-of-the-art 3D editing results with high visual quality, geometry consistency and strong generalization over diverse image categories.

The method significantly advances the capability of single-image 3D editing and provides an effective tool for creative applications. Limitations include challenges with extreme detail preservation and depth errors under very large transformations.
