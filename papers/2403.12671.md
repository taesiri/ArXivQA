# [Enhancing Security of AI-Based Code Synthesis with GitHub Copilot via   Cheap and Efficient Prompt-Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
AI assistants for coding like GitHub Copilot are becoming more popular. However, there are concerns about the security of the code they generate, which limits their adoption. The paper reviews the literature and identifies three main approaches to improving code synthesis by AI: optimizing the output, fine-tuning the model, and optimizing the prompt. However, output optimization and model fine-tuning have limitations around requiring access to proprietary models, being computationally expensive, and needing expert security knowledge.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper focuses on prompt optimization techniques which are fast, low-cost, generalizable, and don't require internal access to models. The authors propose and evaluate three specific prompt altering methods:

1. Scenario-specific: Provide warnings and info related to security risks based on expected functionality. Requires some expert security knowledge.

2. Iterative: Iteratively provide general security commentary to nudge the model. Requires no expert knowledge. 

3. General clause: Add an inception prompt about being a security specialist. Simple to implement but may not influence model.

The methods are orthogonal and could be combined. The authors demonstrate them on GitHub Copilot using real-world coding tasks from the OpenVPN project.

Main Contributions:

1. Review the literature and identify output optimization, model fine-tuning and prompt engineering as ways to improve AI code synthesis.

2. Propose a systematic prompt optimization approach with three concrete methods to enhance security of generated code without needing access to model internals.

3. Evaluate proposed methods on GitHub Copilot, showing a 8% increase in secure samples and 16% decrease in insecure samples compared to no prompt alterations.

The paper lays a foundation for future work on prompt-enhancement systems and evaluating the methods on more code synthesizers. Limitations are around the small dataset size and focusing only on GitHub Copilot.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates three systematic prompt engineering methods (scenario-specific, iterative, general clause) to enhance the security of code synthesized by AI models like GitHub Copilot, demonstrating increased secure code ratios and decreased insecure code ratios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors reviewed the literature and identified three different areas for improving code synthesis from large language models: optimizing the output, model fine-tuning, and prompt engineering. They chose to focus on prompt engineering due to its efficiency, generality, and low costs.

2) They proposed a systematic approach to enhancing the security of AI-generated code via prompt engineering, involving three methods: scenario-specific prompting, iterative prompting, and adding a general alignment-shifting clause (general clause). They also discussed combining these methods.

3) They evaluated the efficiency of the proposed prompt alteration methods on the OpenVPN project. They managed to increase the ratio of secure code generated by up to 8% and decrease the ratio of insecure code generated by up to 16% using the proposed methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating systematic prompt engineering methods to improve the security of code generated by AI models like GitHub Copilot, without needing access to the model internals.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- GitHub Copilot - The proprietary AI code generator that the authors demonstrate their prompt engineering methods on.

- Prompt engineering - The core approach explored in the paper, which involves optimizing the prompts/inputs given to AI code generators to improve the security of the generated code. 

- Code security - The key metric and aspect of code quality focused on in the paper when evaluating the effects of the different prompt engineering methods.

- Scenario-specific prompting - One of the proposed prompt engineering methods that involves providing warnings and details on potential security issues based on the code context. 

- Iterative prompting - Another proposed method involving repeatedly providing new security-related prompts in each interaction with the AI assistant.

- General clause - The third prompt engineering approach explored which uses a general prompt aimed at aligning the AI assistant to prioritize security.

- OpenVPN - The open-source project used to provide real-world code contexts and tasks to evaluate the proposed prompt engineering methods.

So in summary, the core focus is on prompt engineering techniques to improve code security of AI code generators like GitHub Copilot, with specific methods and experiments around this goal. Key terms also include the AI service, code metrics, and datasets referenced.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three main methods for improving code security through prompt engineering: scenario-specific, iterative, and general clause. Can you explain in more detail how each of these methods works and what the key differences are between them? 

2. The scenario-specific method requires some level of security expertise from the user. What are some ways this expert knowledge requirement could be mitigated to make the method more accessible to average users?

3. The iterative method applies a set of general security rules repeatedly to prompt new code generations. How was this rule set designed and what considerations went into making it generally applicable across code security weaknesses?

4. The general clause method aims to shift the AI assistant's alignment by providing an inception prompt about always prioritizing security. What are some key factors that would determine whether such a prompt has the intended influence over the assistant's code generation?

5. The paper evaluated the methods on a small dataset from the OpenVPN project. What are some limitations of this evaluation approach and what steps could be taken in future work to demonstrate more robust, real-world efficacy?  

6. Beyond the methods tested in this paper, what other prompt engineering techniques could hold promise for improving code security from AI assistants?

7. The paper focuses solely on prompt engineering for proprietary black box AI models. How might the options for improving security differ if white box access to the models were available?

8. What unique challenges exist in automatically evaluating the security of AI-generated code that warrant the use of manual inspection over standard static/dynamic analysis tools?

9. The authors recognize their methods likely still have room for improvement in balancing prompt over-specification versus over-generalization. What research directions could help determine optimal prompts to maximize security without sacrificing functionality?

10. The paper considers combining its methods with fine-tuning and output optimization techniques as an area of future work. What unique benefits and limitations might such an ensemble approach have compared to any single method in isolation?
