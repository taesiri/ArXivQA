# [The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What is the impact of different positional encoding schemes on the ability of Transformers to generalize to longer sequence lengths in downstream tasks?The key hypotheses explored in the paper are:1) Commonly used positional encoding methods like absolute position embeddings, Rotary embeddings, and ALiBi are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks.2) Transformers without explicit positional encodings (NoPE) can outperform models with explicit position encodings at length generalization. 3) NoPE can theoretically represent both absolute and relative position information, but empirically learns to encode positions more like a relative scheme.4) Providing intermediate scratchpad outputs is not always sufficient to enable length generalization and the format impacts performance.The authors systematically test these hypotheses by training Transformers with different positional encoding schemes on a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. They measure generalization by training on short sequences and evaluating on longer ones. Their key findings are that NoPE outperforms explicit schemes like ALiBi and Rotary, and behaves more like a relative encoding similar to the T5 scheme. They also find mixed benefits from scratchpad prompting based on the task. Overall, the paper explores the impact of positional encoding choice on extrapolation ability in downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper systematically studies the impact of different positional encoding schemes on the length generalization ability of Transformer models. The main findings are:- Most common explicit positional encodings like ALiBi, Rotary, and absolute position embedding (APE) do not actually help length generalization on downstream tasks, and are outperformed by T5's relative position encoding. - Surprisingly, a decoder-only Transformer without any explicit positional encoding (NoPE) outperforms all other methods at length generalization, while requiring no extra computation.- Theoretically, NoPE can represent both absolute and relative position information. Empirically it learns patterns more similar to T5's relative encoding. - Adding scratchpad/chain-of-thought is not a guaranteed solution for improving length generalization. Its impact depends on the format and task. NoPE and T5's relative encoding attend to both local and global context, unlike other methods.So in summary, the paper shows removing explicit positional encoding in decoder Transformers is better than common positional encoding schemes for length generalization. It also analyzes NoPE theoretically and empirically. The results suggest explicit positional encodings may not be essential for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper systematically compares different positional encoding schemes like absolute, relative, and no positional encoding in Transformer decoders on a variety of reasoning tasks, finding that no positional encoding performs the best for length generalization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of different positional encoding schemes and their impact on length generalization in Transformers. The key contributions are:1. It compares many popular positional encodings (e.g. APE, T5's Relative PE, Rotary, ALiBi) on length generalization, especially in downstream tasks. Most prior work focused on perplexity or only compared APE vs relative PE. 2. It finds that removing positional encoding (NoPE) outperforms all other explicit encodings on a variety of reasoning and mathematical tasks. This challenges the common belief that explicit relative PE is required for length generalization.3. It theoretically shows that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative positions. Empirically it finds NoPE resembles T5's relative PE, explaining its strong performance.4. It analyzes the role of scratchpad and shows its effectiveness depends on the task and format. The best encodings (NoPE and T5's Relative PE) have both local and global attention.5. The study uses modern Transformers and evaluates on algorithmic/compositional tasks. Most prior work used older Transformers or just language modeling.Overall, this is the most comprehensive study on the role of positional encodings for length generalization in Transformers. The theoretical analysis and extensive experiments provide new insights into this important problem. The results suggest removing PE may be the best option, challenging common practices. The tasks and analysis are also more probing than typical language modeling evaluations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Further investigation into the length generalization capabilities of Transformers without positional encodings (NoPE). The authors found that NoPE outperformed explicit positional encodings on several tasks, so more work could be done to understand the mechanisms by which NoPE represents positional information and generalizes to longer sequences.- Testing length generalization on a wider variety of tasks beyond the algorithmic/mathematical tasks focused on in this paper. The authors note their evaluation was limited to certain synthetic tasks, so evaluating on more natural language tasks could provide additional insights.- Experiments with large-scale pretrained language models using different positional encodings, once publicly available models are trained. The authors were limited to training smaller models from scratch, so scaling up could reveal more about how pretraining affects the choice of positional encoding.- Further exploration of the impact of different scratchpad prompting formats on length generalization. The authors found the effectiveness of scratchpad was highly dependent on the task and format used, suggesting more work is needed to understand when and how to use scratchpad effectively.- Analysis of other model architectures like encoder-decoder Transformers. This paper focused only on decoder-only autoregressive Transformers, so extending the analysis to other architectures could be informative.- Investigating modifications to Transformer architecture along with choice of positional encoding to improve length generalization. The two could synergistically combine to achieve better generalization.In summary, the main future directions are to conduct more extensive empirical analysis on the role of positional encodings and architectural choices in Transformer length generalization across diverse tasks, datasets, and model architectures. There are still many open questions around the best practices for achieving robust generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates the impact of different positional encoding schemes on the length generalization ability of decoder-only Transformers. The authors systematically compare popular positional encodings like absolute position embeddings, relative position biases, rotary position encodings, and no explicit positional encoding on a variety of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Their key findings are: (1) Commonly used position encodings like rotary and absolute embeddings perform poorly on length generalization compared to relative position biases. (2) Surprisingly, not using any explicit positional encoding performs the best, outperforming all other schemes. (3) Theoretically, transformer decoders without positional encoding are capable of implicitly learning both absolute and relative positions. Empirically, they seem to learn something closer to relative position biases. (4) Adding scratchpads/chain-of-thought is not always helpful for length generalization, and the format impacts performance. Overall, their work suggests explicit positional encodings may not be essential for length generalization in transformer decoders, and simpler models without them can work better in practice.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper conducts an empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with different positional encoding schemes, including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, Rotary, and no positional encoding (NoPE). The models are evaluated on a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks that require compositionality and planning. The key findings are:Most commonly used positional encoding methods like ALiBi, Rotary, and APE perform poorly on length generalization for downstream tasks, while T5's Relative PE does better. Surprisingly, NoPE consistently matches or outperforms the top performing explicit positional encodings across tasks. Theoretical analysis shows NoPE can represent both absolute and relative position information. Empirically, NoPE exhibits patterns most similar to T5's relative encoding. Scratchpad does not universally help length generalization, and its effectiveness is highly sensitive to format. Overall, the paper provides strong evidence that explicit positional encodings are not required for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well, and simpler approaches like NoPE are very competitive for length extrapolation in reasoning tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper systematically compares the length generalization performance of Transformer models with different position encoding schemes, including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative Position Encoding, ALiBi, Rotary, and no explicit position encoding (NoPE). The evaluation is done on a diverse set of reasoning and algorithmic tasks where models are trained on examples up to a certain length and tested on longer examples. The paper trains Transformer models from scratch with each position encoding method using the same model architecture, dataset splits, training procedure, and hyperparameters. The results show that commonly used position encoding methods like ALiBi, Rotary, and APE perform poorly on length generalization compared to T5's relative position encoding. Surprisingly, NoPE outperforms all explicit position encoding methods while requiring no additional computation in the attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis shows NoPE can represent both absolute and relative position encodings. Empirically it learns patterns similar to T5's relative position encoding. The paper also finds that adding scratchpad does not universally help length generalization across tasks and is highly sensitive to scratchpad format. Overall, the paper provides strong empirical evidence and analysis that explicit position encodings may not be necessary for length generalization in decoder-only Transformers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It studies the effect of different positional encoding schemes on the length generalization capability of Transformers, specifically decoder-only Transformers like GPT. Length generalization refers to the ability to generalize from shorter context lengths seen during training to longer ones during inference.- It compares popular positional encoding methods like absolute position embeddings, relative position encodings (e.g. T5), Rotary position encodings (used in recent models like PaLM and OPT), ALiBi, and also no positional encoding. - The main finding is that removing explicit positional encodings altogether (NoPE) leads to the best length generalization performance on a range of reasoning tasks. NoPE outperforms commonly used schemes like Rotary, ALiBi, and absolute position embeddings.- The paper shows theoretically that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative position information implicitly. Empirically it finds NoPE learns patterns similar to relative position encodings in practice when trained with SGD.- It studies if providing intermediate scratchpad output helps length generalization across different positional encodings. It finds scratchpad is not universally helpful, and its effectiveness depends on the task structure.Overall, the key question addressed is understanding the impact of different positional encoding choices on the length generalization capability of Transformers. The paper provides evidence that removing explicit positional encoding can be beneficial for generalization in decoder-only Transformers, challenging common practice.
