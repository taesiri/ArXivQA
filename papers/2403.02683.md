# [Learning to Defer to a Population: A Meta-Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning to Defer to a Population: A Meta-Learning Approach":

Problem:
Existing learning to defer (L2D) systems assume the human expert providing demonstrations at test time is the same as the one(s) seen during training. This fails if the expert's identity or behavior changes between training and deployment. The paper aims to develop an L2D system that can cope with never-before-seen experts at test time.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors formulate the problem as "learning to defer to a population", where the system is trained on demonstrations from a population of experts. At test time, the system can then adapt to a new sample from this population using only a small "context set" of that expert's decisions.

The authors propose two meta-learning approaches to enable adaptation using the context set: 
1) Meta-optimization: Fine-tune the pretrained L2D system on the context set.
2) Model-based: Use a neural process to encode the context set and pass its representation to the deferral function. An attentive variant allows emphasizing similar context points.

These approaches mean the system is no longer customized to individual experts but can leverage commonalities of the whole population. Surrogate loss functions are provided for this setting and proven to be consistent.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the problem of "learning to defer to a population" to enable coping with varying experts.
- Proposes meta-learning for quick adaptation using context sets of expert decisions. Gives optimization and model-based implementations. 
- Defines consistent surrogate losses for learning in this setting.
- Validates the approaches on image recognition, traffic sign detection and skin lesion diagnosis, showing improved performance as expert variability increases.

The summary covers the key details around the problem, solution and contributions of the paper in a way that provides a clear understanding without requiring the full technical details. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or add anything to the summary.
