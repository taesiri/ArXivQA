# [A novel feature selection framework for incomplete data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04171)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel feature selection framework for incomplete datasets that iterates between missing value imputation and feature importance learning. The framework has two stages: the Matrix Imputation Stage (M-stage) imputes missing values by fitting multiple basic imputation results while weighting features based on their importance, enhancing robustness and avoiding bias; and the Weight Learning Stage (W-stage) employs an improved ReliefF algorithm called μ-reliefA to update feature importance vectors based on the imputed data. The two stages alternate, with the updated feature importance from the W-stage fed back into the M-stage for re-imputing. Experiments on real benchmark datasets, both artificially made incomplete and inherently incomplete, demonstrate superior performance over combining standard imputation methods with feature selection. Significance testing confirms the proposed EWMC+μ-reliefA framework statistically outperforms other compared methods. The framework provides an effective way to perform feature selection on incomplete data without separating imputation and losing feature importance information.
