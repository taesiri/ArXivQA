# [Skeleton2vec: A Self-supervised Learning Framework with Contextualized   Target Representations for Skeleton Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00921)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing self-supervised methods for skeleton-based action recognition use low-level features like raw coordinates or motion as prediction targets for masked regions. This is suboptimal for modeling high-level spatiotemporal structures.

Solution - Skeleton2vec Framework:  
- Uses a teacher encoder to generate latent contextualized representations from unmasked input as prediction targets. These incorporate global context rather than just local features.

- Employs a student encoder and lightweight decoder with masked input for prediction.

- Proposes motion-aware tube masking strategy:
  * Divides sequence into tubes, with shared masks within each tube over time. Prevents information leakage between frames.
  * Higher chance of masking joints with more motion, focusing model on semantic regions.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates superior performance from using contextualized representations versus low-level isolated targets for prediction.

- Introduces motion-aware tube masking to compel modeling of long-range dependencies and focus on informative joint motions.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets across multiple testing protocols like linear evaluation, fine-tuning, semi-supervised learning.

In summary, Skeleton2vec is a self-supervised 3D action representation learning framework that uses higher-level contextualized prediction targets and a tailored masking strategy for skeleton sequences. Experiments validate its effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Skeleton2vec, a self-supervised learning framework for 3D skeleton-based action recognition that uses a teacher model to generate contextualized representations as prediction targets and a motion-aware tube masking strategy to focus the model on semantically richer regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of Skeleton2vec are three-fold:

1. It proposes the Skeleton2vec framework, which uses contextualized representations from a teacher model as prediction targets. This enables the learned representations to have stronger semantic associations compared to using raw joints or temporal motion. 

2. It introduces a motion-aware tube masking strategy that performs persistent masking of joints within tubes based on spatial motion intensity. This forces the model to build better long-range spatiotemporal connections and focus on more semantic-rich regions.

3. It validates the effectiveness of the method on three large-scale 3D skeleton-based action recognition datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple testing protocols.

In summary, the key innovation is using a teacher model to generate contextualized prediction targets, combined with a specialized motion-aware masking strategy tailored for skeleton sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach over previous self-supervised methods for 3D action representation learning.
