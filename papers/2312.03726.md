# [Interpretation modeling: Social grounding of sentences by reasoning over   their implicit moral judgments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Natural language understanding inevitably has to deal with implicit, hidden meanings that require social and contextual grounding to interpret. 
- Most NLP models rely on single gold standard interpretations that fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and diversity of human understanding.

Proposed Solution - Interpretation Modeling (IM):  
- Proposes a new task called Interpretation Modeling that involves generating multiple reader interpretations of sentences by reasoning over their underlying semantics and implicit meanings.
- Interpretations are guided by annotations of reader attitudes towards the author and their inferences of subtle moral judgments embedded in the sentences, approximating social grounding.
- Proposes one-to-one and one-to-many text generation frameworks to decode sentences into diverse interpretations, using prompting and ordering strategies to encourage diversity.

Contributions:
- Introduction and formalization of a novel and challenging natural language understanding task called Interpretation Modeling
- Curation of a new dataset called origamIM containing 2,018 sentences with 9,851 annotations of interpretations, attitudes and moral judgments  
- Development of automated models for one-to-one and one-to-many interpretation generation, using GPT-2 and T5 architectures
- Analyses demonstrating importance of modeling multiple interpretations for unearthing implicit toxicity, with applications for content moderation

The key premise is that explicitly modeling differing human interpretations by grounding language in its social context can uncover nuanced layers of meaning missed by models reliant on single gold standards. Rigorous human and automatic evaluations analyze the diversity and validity of generated interpretations.
