# [One-shot Imitation in a Non-Stationary Environment via Multi-Modal Skill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the challenging problem of one-shot imitation learning of complex, long-horizon tasks in non-stationary environments where the underlying dynamics may change over time. Specifically, the paper aims to address three key challenges: (1) learning from a single demonstration, (2) adapting to varying unseen dynamics, and (3) learning long-horizon multi-stage tasks. Prior works have limitations in addressing these challenges in a unified framework.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called OnIS that enables one-shot imitation and zero-shot adaptation in non-stationary environments. The key ideas are:

(1) Leverage task compositionality by representing complex tasks as semantic skill sequences using a pretrained vision-language model (CLIP). The skills are learned via contrastive learning on offline expert datasets to disentangle them from varying dynamics.

(2) Learn a dynamics embedding using contrastive learning and vector quantization that captures environment dynamics from state-action subsequences.  

(3) Enable dynamics-aware skill transfer where skills adapt to the inferred dynamics using meta-learning.

In deployment, OnIS takes a single demonstration and translates it to a semantic skill sequence. Each skill in the sequence is then optimized for the current inferred dynamics before execution. This allows imitating unseen tasks and adapting to varying dynamics.

Main Contributions:

- Propose OnIS, a novel framework for one-shot imitation and zero-shot adaptation in non-stationary environments

- Develop a dynamics-aware skill transfer scheme that adapts skills to varying dynamics  

- Create an expert dataset of long-horizon multi-stage robot manipulation tasks for research

- Demonstrate OnIS's superior performance in (i) one-shot imitation, (ii) generalization to varying dynamics, (iii) extending to varying demonstration modalities

In summary, the paper explores task compositionality and multimodal pretraining to address the challenging problem of one-shot imitation learning of complex tasks in non-stationary environments. The proposed OnIS framework outperforms prior state-of-the-art across several metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework, OnIS, that enables one-shot imitation learning of long-horizon tasks and zero-shot adaptation across changing dynamics by leveraging a vision-language model to represent skills and disentangling skill semantics from environment dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting the OnIS framework to enable one-shot imitation and zero-shot adaptation. This allows learning a new task from a single demonstration while adapting to changes in environment dynamics.

2) Developing a dynamics-aware skill transfer scheme to adapt skills in a non-stationary environment. This allows skills learned on some dynamics to transfer to new unseen dynamics. 

3) Creating an expert dataset for long-horizon, multi-stage Meta-world tasks with diverse robotic manipulation skills, and making it publicly available.

4) Testing the OnIS framework with several imitation learning use cases, and evaluating it in terms of one-shot imitation performance, generalization ability to different environment conditions, and extensibility to demonstrations in different modalities.

The key ideas are using a vision-language model to represent skills in a common semantic space, disentangling skill and environment dynamics with contrastive learning, and exploring meta-learning to enable dynamics-aware skill transfer. This allows one-shot imitation and adaptation to varying dynamics.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- One-shot imitation learning - The paper focuses on enabling agents to learn new tasks from a single demonstration.

- Non-stationary environment - The framework aims to enable adaptation to changing, non-stationary environments over time where the dynamics may vary.  

- Multi-modal skill - Skills are represented in a multi-modal (vision and language) semantic embedding space.

- Skill transfer - Skills learned on offline datasets are transferred and adapted to new environments and tasks. 

- Dynamics disentanglement - The approach disentangles task-relevant skill representations from environment dynamics to enable better generalization.

- Compositionality - Long-horizon, multi-stage tasks are tackled by decomposing them into semantic skill sequences and transferring the skills.

- Contrastive learning - Contrastive losses are employed to learn invariant feature spaces for skills and dynamics.

- Meta-learning - Meta-learning based approaches are explored to enable rapid adaptation of skills.

So in summary, the key focus is on one-shot imitation, skill transfer, and adaptation in non-stationary environments by leveraging multi-modal skill representations. Contrastive learning and meta-learning play important roles.
