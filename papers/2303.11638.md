# [Human Pose as Compositional Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to better model the dependencies between body joints to improve human pose estimation, especially in challenging cases with occlusion. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes a new pose representation called "Pose as Compositional Tokens" (PCT) that models the dependencies between joints. 

- PCT represents a pose using discrete tokens, each encoding a substructure involving multiple interdependent joints. This allows modeling joint dependencies and context.

- Shows PCT can work for both 2D and 3D pose estimation with a simple framework.

- Achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on COCO, MPII, CrowdPose, OCHuman, SyncOcc for 2D pose estimation and on Human3.6M for 3D.

- Shows significantly improved performance on occluded joints, validating the advantage of modeling joint dependencies.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a structured representation PCT that models joint dependencies and context to improve pose estimation, especially on occluded joints. The experiments validate its effectiveness and general applicability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new structured representation for human pose called "Pose as Compositional Tokens" (PCT). The key ideas are:

- Represent a pose using M discrete tokens, where each token encodes a sub-structure involving several interdependent joints. This allows modeling the joint dependencies and context.

- Learn a shared codebook of N entries to quantize the tokens. So a pose is represented by M indices to the codebook entries. 

- Jointly learn an encoder network to compose the tokens from a pose, a codebook to quantize the tokens, and a decoder network to reconstruct the pose from the quantized tokens.

- Cast pose estimation as predicting the token categories (codebook indices) from an image using the learned representation, followed by the decoder to reconstruct the full pose. 

- Show strong performance on 2D and 3D pose estimation benchmarks, especially on occluded joints where modeling context is more important.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing the compositional token representation to model joint dependencies and context in pose estimation, in contrast to standard coordinate or heatmap representations that treat joints independently. The results validate its advantages.
