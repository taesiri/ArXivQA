# [Human Pose as Compositional Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to better model the dependencies between body joints to improve human pose estimation, especially in challenging cases with occlusion. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes a new pose representation called "Pose as Compositional Tokens" (PCT) that models the dependencies between joints. 

- PCT represents a pose using discrete tokens, each encoding a substructure involving multiple interdependent joints. This allows modeling joint dependencies and context.

- Shows PCT can work for both 2D and 3D pose estimation with a simple framework.

- Achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on COCO, MPII, CrowdPose, OCHuman, SyncOcc for 2D pose estimation and on Human3.6M for 3D.

- Shows significantly improved performance on occluded joints, validating the advantage of modeling joint dependencies.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a structured representation PCT that models joint dependencies and context to improve pose estimation, especially on occluded joints. The experiments validate its effectiveness and general applicability.
