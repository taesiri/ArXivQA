# [Second Order Methods for Bandit Optimization and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bandit convex optimization (BCO) is an important framework for online decision making under uncertainty. Existing algorithms that achieve tight regret bounds have prohibitive computational complexity for high dimensional problems.
- Online control with adversarial noise is challenging. The best known regret rate was $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$. It was an open question whether the optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ rate can be attained. 

Proposed Solutions:

1. For BCO:
- Propose a simple and efficient "Bandit Newton Step" (BNS) algorithm for a broad class of $\kappa$-convex losses like quadratic, generalized linear models etc.
- BNS attains $O(d^{2.5}\sqrt{T})$ regret with $O(d^2)$ per-iteration complexity. This is the first computationally efficient algorithm for several BCO problems like bandit logistic regression.

2. For Online Control: 
- Leverage the affine memory structure in control problems to attain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret even with fully adversarial noise. This resolves an open question.
- Propose an efficient "Newton Bandit Perturbation Controller" algorithm by reducing control to BCO with affine memory.

3. Hardness of BCO with General Memory:
- Provide a $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on regret even for smooth quadratic losses. This separates control from general BCO with memory.

Main Contributions:

- First efficient BCO algorithm for rich $\kappa$-convex losses with optimal regret.
- First optimal regret algorithm for adversarial control by using affine memory structure. 
- Separated control and general BCO-M via lower bound construction.

The paper makes significant progress on long-standing open problems in bandit convex optimization and online control. The proposed algorithms are simple, practical and come with strong theoretical guarantees.
