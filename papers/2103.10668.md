# [API2Com: On the Improvement of Automatically Generated Code Comments   Using API Documentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Code comments are important to help developers understand software programs quickly. However, comments are often missing or outdated in complex software projects. 
- Several automatic comment generation models have been developed using neural networks, but their performance is limited. Recent works show that incorporating external knowledge sources such as UML diagrams can help improve the generated comments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes API2Com, a model that leverages Application Programming Interface (API) Documentations as the external knowledge source to enrich comment generation. 
- API Docs provide detailed descriptions of methods and can give better context about code functionality.  
- API2Com uses a Transformer architecture with three encoders - for code tokens, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and API Docs. The outputs are concatenated and passed to the decoder to generate comments.

Experiments:
- Experiments conducted on 130,000+ Java methods from CodeSearchNet dataset. 
- Various configurations evaluated - with/without API Docs, AST etc. Compared to baselines like RNN-based models.
- Automatic evaluation using BLEU, METEOR etc. and human evaluation on sample data.

Results:
- Surprisingly, adding API Docs leads to negligible improvement in performance. Further analysis showed adding too many API Docs reduces effectiveness due to long input text.  
- API Docs improve metrics by 3-4% when only 1 API used in method. As number of APIs increases, improvements reduce significantly.

Conclusions:
- API Docs can be useful for comment generation when number of APIs is limited. New techniques needed to identify and select most informative API Docs from method, instead of using all.
- Provides insights for future work on effectively incorporating API documentation knowledge for code comment generation.

In summary, the paper proposed using API documentation as external knowledge for neural comment generation models. But experiments showed need for selective methods to exploit documentation for methods with multiple APIs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes incorporating API documentations as an external knowledge source to enhance neural code comment generation, but finds that simply concatenating all API docs leads to negligible improvement overall, though it can help when methods have fewer than 3 APIs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a model called API2Com that leverages Application Programming Interface Documentations (API Docs) as an external knowledge source to improve automatic code comment generation. Specifically, the paper:

1) Proposes a Transformer-based model that encodes API documentation along with source code and AST to generate comments. 

2) Performs experiments on a large Java dataset to evaluate API2Com and compare it to other baseline models.

3) Finds that incorporating API Docs only leads to minor improvements in performance. Further analysis reveals that as the number of APIs used in a method increases, the value of API Docs decreases due to added noise. 

4) Provides insights that although API Docs can help improve comment generation when less than 3 APIs are used, new techniques are needed to identify and select the most informative API Docs from a method to fully exploit this external knowledge source.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and empirically evaluating the idea of using API documentation to improve neural code comment generation, while also identifying limitations and future work to make this approach more effective.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Code comment generation
- API documentation
- External knowledge source
- Transformer model
- RNN-based architectures
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L (evaluation metrics)
- Number of APIs used in methods
- Informative APIs
- API categories

The paper proposes a model called API2Com that leverages Application Programming Interface (API) documentations to improve automatic code comment generation. It uses API docs along with code snippets and ASTs as input to Transformer and RNN-based models. The key findings are that while API docs can be useful for comment generation when a small number of APIs are used, adding docs for a large number of APIs actually hurts performance. The paper recommends identifying informative APIs rather than using all documentation. Overall, the key focus is on utilizing API documentation to improve neural comment generation models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes concatenating the documentation of all APIs used in a method into a single input. What are some potential issues with this approach when the number of APIs increases? How could the method be improved to address this?

2. The results show that incorporating API documentation improves performance when only 1-2 APIs are used, but decreases performance when more APIs are used. What explanations does the paper give for this finding? Do you agree with their reasoning?

3. The paper uses a Transformer architecture for the model. What are the key advantages of Transformer over RNN-based architectures like LSTM and GRU for this task? Do the results support the use of Transformer?

4. AST information is commonly used in other code comment generation papers. However, adding AST decreased performance slightly in this model. Why might this be the case? How important do you think AST information is for this task?

5. Could the categories of APIs used provide useful signals? How could the method leverage API categories to determine which documentation to include? What challenges might this present?

6. The paper suggests identifying the most "informative" APIs to include documentation for. What criteria could be used to determine how informative an API is? Would this require human judgement or could it be automated?  

7. The results show adding documentation for methods with only 1 API improves scores the most. Why might this be? Does this finding suggest any ways to improve the approach?

8. Could weighting schemes for API documentation help address cases where many APIs are used? What factors should determine the weights for each API's documentation?

9. The model is evaluated on a Java dataset. Do you think the findings would generalize to other programming languages? What differences between languages should be considered?

10. The paper uses BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L for evaluation. What are the limitations of these automatic metrics? Would human evaluation on a sample be a useful complement?
