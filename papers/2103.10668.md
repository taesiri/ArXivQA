# [API2Com: On the Improvement of Automatically Generated Code Comments   Using API Documentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Code comments are important to help developers understand software programs quickly. However, comments are often missing or outdated in complex software projects. 
- Several automatic comment generation models have been developed using neural networks, but their performance is limited. Recent works show that incorporating external knowledge sources such as UML diagrams can help improve the generated comments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes API2Com, a model that leverages Application Programming Interface (API) Documentations as the external knowledge source to enrich comment generation. 
- API Docs provide detailed descriptions of methods and can give better context about code functionality.  
- API2Com uses a Transformer architecture with three encoders - for code tokens, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and API Docs. The outputs are concatenated and passed to the decoder to generate comments.

Experiments:
- Experiments conducted on 130,000+ Java methods from CodeSearchNet dataset. 
- Various configurations evaluated - with/without API Docs, AST etc. Compared to baselines like RNN-based models.
- Automatic evaluation using BLEU, METEOR etc. and human evaluation on sample data.

Results:
- Surprisingly, adding API Docs leads to negligible improvement in performance. Further analysis showed adding too many API Docs reduces effectiveness due to long input text.  
- API Docs improve metrics by 3-4% when only 1 API used in method. As number of APIs increases, improvements reduce significantly.

Conclusions:
- API Docs can be useful for comment generation when number of APIs is limited. New techniques needed to identify and select most informative API Docs from method, instead of using all.
- Provides insights for future work on effectively incorporating API documentation knowledge for code comment generation.

In summary, the paper proposed using API documentation as external knowledge for neural comment generation models. But experiments showed need for selective methods to exploit documentation for methods with multiple APIs.
