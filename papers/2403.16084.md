# [Argument Quality Assessment in the Age of Instruction-Following Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16084)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the quality of arguments is critical for applications like opinion formation and decision making, but it is very challenging due to the diversity of quality notions and subjectivity of perception.  
- Prior computational models have limitations in reliably assessing argument quality across contexts due to separated input/output spaces and implicit mappings.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to overcome limitations. 
- Systematically teach LLMs concepts of argumentation theories, circumstances of arguing, and ethical constraints, beyond just prompts.

Key Contributions:
- Survey of recent Computational Argumentation research directions on conceptual notions, influence factors and computational models for argument quality.
- Blueprint for impactful research on instruction fine-tuning of LLMs for argument quality assessment, through acquiring seed instructions, reinforcement learning, and prompt design.
- Analysis of emerging opportunities in applications like debating technologies, argument search, discussion moderation and writing support.
- Discussion of ethical concerns and limitations regarding reliability, privacy, biases and harms.

In summary, the paper surveys the open challenges for reliably assessing argument quality computationally, and proposes advanced instruction fine-tuning of large language models as a promising direction to overcome limitations. A blueprint is provided for teaching models argumentation concepts and circumstantial knowledge systematically. Opportunities and ethical issues are critically analyzed.
