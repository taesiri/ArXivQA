# [Argument Quality Assessment in the Age of Instruction-Following Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16084)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the quality of arguments is critical for applications like opinion formation and decision making, but it is very challenging due to the diversity of quality notions and subjectivity of perception.  
- Prior computational models have limitations in reliably assessing argument quality across contexts due to separated input/output spaces and implicit mappings.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to overcome limitations. 
- Systematically teach LLMs concepts of argumentation theories, circumstances of arguing, and ethical constraints, beyond just prompts.

Key Contributions:
- Survey of recent Computational Argumentation research directions on conceptual notions, influence factors and computational models for argument quality.
- Blueprint for impactful research on instruction fine-tuning of LLMs for argument quality assessment, through acquiring seed instructions, reinforcement learning, and prompt design.
- Analysis of emerging opportunities in applications like debating technologies, argument search, discussion moderation and writing support.
- Discussion of ethical concerns and limitations regarding reliability, privacy, biases and harms.

In summary, the paper surveys the open challenges for reliably assessing argument quality computationally, and proposes advanced instruction fine-tuning of large language models as a promising direction to overcome limitations. A blueprint is provided for teaching models argumentation concepts and circumstantial knowledge systematically. Opportunities and ethical issues are critically analyzed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper surveys recent research on computational argument quality assessment, argues that large language models instructed systematically on argumentation theories and settings can overcome key challenges, and sketches a blueprint for impactful research on leveraging such models to enable applications like overcoming filter bubbles through quality-based argument search rankings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A survey of recent research (83 papers) on argument quality and its assessment, organized into three general directions - conceptual notions, influence factors, and computational models.

2. A blueprint for future research on using instruction-following large language models (LLMs) for argument quality assessment. The blueprint outlines ways to systematically teach LLMs concepts, theories, and constraints related to argumentation in order to enable more reliable assessment that accounts for the diversity of quality notions and subjectivity of perception.

So in summary, the paper provides a structured overview of recent work in this area and lays out a path forward for developing LLM-based models to substantially advance the state of the art on this challenging task. The key idea is to leverage LLMs' ability to integrate knowledge across contexts by instructing them appropriately on how to approach argument quality assessment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

Computational Argumentation, Argument Quality, Large Language Model, Instruction Fine-Tuning

The abstract clearly states these keywords:

"In this position paper, we start from a brief survey of argument quality research, where we identify the diversity of quality notions and the subjectiveness of their perception as the main hurdles towards substantial progress on argument quality assessment.
We argue that the capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment."

The keywords also appear in the conclusion:

"In this survey-based position paper, we have raised the question of how to drive research on instruction-following large language models (LLMs) for argument quality to substantially evolve the state of the art."

So the main keywords or key terms are:
- Computational Argumentation 
- Argument Quality
- Large Language Model
- Instruction Fine-Tuning


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a blueprint for instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for argument quality assessment. What are the key stages of this blueprint and what is the rationale behind each stage?

2. The paper argues that simply fine-tuning LLMs on argument quality data is not enough. Why does instruction fine-tuning go beyond this and what capabilities does it provide over standard fine-tuning? 

3. What types of instructions are proposed to teach the LLM about argument quality assessment? Provide some examples and explain why these instructions are important.

4. The paper discusses representing the task in the joint input-output space. What does this mean and why is it beneficial for leveraging knowledge across tasks and contexts?

5. What evaluation strategy does the paper recommend for assessing LLM-based argument quality models? Why is a mix of absolute and relative assessment proposed?

6. The paper argues LLMs have processed knowledge about quality notions and influence factors. What evidence supports this and why does this reduce the need for task-specific fine-tuning?  

7. What are the limitations of the proposed blueprint? What challenges still need to be addressed in realizing systematic instruction fine-tuning?

8. What ethical concerns arise from using LLMs to effectively predict human perception of argument quality? How can these be mitigated?

9. The paper discusses debating technologies as one application area. How could instruction fine-tuning advance technologies like Project Debater?

10. Aside from the applications discussed, what other potential applications could benefit from LLM-based argument quality assessment? How might they employ the proposed approach?
