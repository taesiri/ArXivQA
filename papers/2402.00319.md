# [SCO-VIST: Social Interaction Commonsense Knowledge-based Visual   Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Visual storytelling aims to generate a coherent story from a sequence of images. However, most existing methods lack common sense reasoning and generate stories that sound generic, are not grounded in the images, and lack coherence. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called SCO-VIST that incorporates social interaction commonsense knowledge to enhance understanding of situations, characters, and actions.

- The framework has 3 stages:
   1) Construct a story graph representing events (captions), social commonsense, and themes. Captions are generated for each image. Commonsense related to intents, effects of actions etc. is extracted using Comet-ATOMIC.
   2) Convert the graph into a weighted graph using similarity between nodes or graph learning. This models likelihood of transitions between events.
   3) Extract optimal storyline using shortest path algorithm. Generate story with Transformer decoder.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces a framework to incorporate social interaction commonsense knowledge for visual storytelling
- Constructs a heterogeneous story graph and analyses methods to assign edge weights based on similarity or graph learning
- The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics designed for evaluating open-ended text generation
- Human evaluation studies also show the model produces more coherent, diverse, and visually grounded stories

In summary, the paper presents a new approach to integrate social commonsense into visual storytelling to generate more human-like and engaging stories. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SCO-VIST, a visual storytelling framework that represents images as a graph incorporating social interaction commonsense knowledge and uses Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to extract an optimal sequence of story events for generating coherent and visually grounded stories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing a social-interaction commonsense enhanced visual storytelling (VST) framework that improves understanding of social situations and characters' feelings.

2) Designing a heterogeneous story graph and conducting analysis on the role of node and edge construction and learning over the visual storytelling dataset.  

3) Showing that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when comparing automatic metrics designed for evaluating VST.

4) Conducting human evaluation studies and demonstrating that the framework consistently and significantly outperforms several strong baselines.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new VST framework called SCO-VIST that incorporates social interaction commonsense knowledge to generate more coherent, engaging, and human-like stories compared to existing approaches. The effectiveness of SCO-VIST is shown through extensive experiments and evaluations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Visual storytelling - The task of automatically generating a coherent textual story from a sequence of images.

- Social interaction commonsense - Knowledge about everyday social situations, interactions, and behavioral responses that can provide context and reasoning ability to make stories more human-like. 

- Story graph - A heterogeneous graph containing nodes representing image captions, themes, and commonsense linked with causal ordering to capture potential story events and transitions.

- Edge weights - Weights assigned to edges in the story graph using similarity metrics or graph learning to indicate likelihood of transition between connected nodes/events.

- Storyline extraction - Finding the optimal path through the weighted story graph to obtain the sequence of story events.

- Encoder-decoder model - A neural network architecture used for the text generation component, consisting of an encoder to represent the input and a decoder to generate the output story.

- Evaluation metrics - Automatic metrics like RoViST, UNION, SPICE used to evaluate visual grounding, coherence and semantics. Human evaluation was also conducted.  

In summary, the key ideas involve representing images and commonsense knowledge as a story graph to plan the storyline, and using encoders/decoders to generate the final textual story output. Both automatic and human evaluations are used to assess story quality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a social-interaction commonsense enhanced framework with 3 stages. Can you explain in detail the purpose and process involved in each stage? What is the intuition behind breaking down the framework into these 3 stages?

2. In Stage 1, the paper constructs a heterogeneous story graph consisting of caption, theme and commonsense nodes. Why does the framework opt to use image captions compared to directly using visual features from the images? What is the rationale behind connecting the different types of nodes in the causal ordering described? 

3. The paper conducts experiments on assigning edge weights between connected nodes in the story graph using cosine similarity and PMI in Stage 2. Can you elaborate on the calculations involved for both methods? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach? 

4. For graph learning using the Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN), can you explain how the cross-entropy loss function in Equation 1 helps learn useful node embeddings and refine edge weights appropriately for the story graph?

5. In Stage 3, Floyd-Warshall algorithm is utilized to find the shortest path in order to extract the optimal storyline from the weighted graph. Why is finding the shortest path equivalent to extracting the best sequence of events for story generation?

6. From the ablation study in Section 5.3, what hypotheses can you make about the effect and importance of explicitly extracting a storyline versus using an end-to-end model that takes in node embeddings for story decoding?

7. Can you analyze the human evaluation results and elaborate on why the model performs significantly better on object-based stories compared to the baselines according to Table 3?

8. What potential limitations exist in the datasets, evaluation metrics or model architecture used in this paper? How can these be improved? 

9. The paper claims the model is capable of generating more diverse outputs compared to baselines as depicted in Figure 2. Do you think this diversity translates to better stories and how can diversity be measured more accurately? 

10. Can you suggest any future work and improvements that can be made to the proposed visual storytelling framework and commonsense reasoning aspects based on the conclusions presented?
