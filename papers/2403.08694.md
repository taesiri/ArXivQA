# [TeaMs-RL: Teaching LLMs to Teach Themselves Better Instructions via   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 often require extensive human involvement for generating training data or providing reinforcement learning feedback. This can be costly and prone to issues like bias. 
- Alternative self-instruct methods also frequently query external expert models like ChatGPT, raising monetary and environmental concerns.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based method to generate high-quality instruction data to train LLMs, without needing much human involvement or excessive external queries.
- They train an "instructor LLM" policy using RL to teach an "expert LLM" to produce diverse, complex instructions.
- The generated instructions are then used to query the expert LLM to create instruction-response training data pairs. 
- This data is then used in a single supervised fine-tuning step to enhance the capabilities of foundation LLMs like Llama in handling complex instructions.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the possibility of generating high-quality training data and aligning LLMs without human feedback.
- Significantly reduces expert LLM queries compared to methods like WizardLM.
- Enhances LLM's ability to handle complex instructions after just a single fine-tuning step.
- Improves model privacy protection compared to baseline.
- Highlights that thoughtful instruction framing using RL can be more impactful than generating responses using expert LLMs/human feedback.

In summary, the key innovation is using RL to generate high-quality diversity-enhanced instructions to train LLMs effectively, in a economical, privacy-preserving and environmentally sustainable manner.
