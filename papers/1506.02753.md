# Inverting Visual Representations with Convolutional Networks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that image representations learned by convolutional neural networks can be inverted to gain insights into the properties and invariances of the representations. Specifically, the authors propose training convolutional networks to reconstruct images from their feature representations. By analyzing the reconstructions, they aim to understand:- What information is preserved and discarded by different layers of a CNN?- How robust are the feature representations to perturbations? - What can be learned by traversing the feature space, e.g. via interpolations or random samples?The core idea is that the reconstructed images provide a window into the structure of the feature space learned by the CNN. Properties like color and spatial structure that are visible in reconstructions from higher layers must be preserved in the feature representation. On the other hand, details that are lost indicate invariances of the representation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that inverting representations with convolutional networks reveals insights into what and how much information is captured by the representations of a CNN. Analyzing the reconstructions allows understanding the invariances and information content of deep image features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a method to invert and analyze visual feature representations by training convolutional neural networks to reconstruct images from feature vectors. Specifically:- They propose training convolutional networks to predict the expected pre-image (average of natural images that could have produced the feature vector) given a feature vector. This allows inverting feature representations in a way that captures a learned natural image prior.- They apply the approach to invert and analyze features from convolutional networks (AlexNet) as well as traditional vision features like HOG, SIFT, and LBP. - Inverting AlexNet shows that higher layers still retain color and rough object position, with most information in the pattern of nonzero activations rather than their precise values.- Reconstructions from fully connected layers and even predicted class probabilities still resemble the original image, indicating the "dark knowledge" in small non-predicted probabilities.- The learned natural image priors allow realistic reconstruction from very compact representations like HOG and sparse SIFT.- Analyses like perturbing features and interpolating between vectors provide insights into the invariances and information captured by the representations.- Overall, the inversion method provides a useful tool to understand and visualize the properties of visual feature representations, both hand-designed and learned. The key innovation is training feedforward convolutional networks to invert representations in a way that incorporates natural image statistics.
