# [Weakly Supervised Detection of Hallucinations in LLM Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02798)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a weakly supervised technique to audit large language models (LLMs) and detect if they internally encode anomalous patterns like hallucinations or stereotypes. The method employs subset scanning across LLM layers to identify pivotal nodes and input sentences responsible for encoding these patterns. It extends prior subset scanning methods by handling cases where LLM activations for anomalous sentences may shift in either direction. The approach only requires access to factually "normal" reference data during testing and does not need exposure to labeled anomalous samples. Experiments confirm BERT has limited capacity for hallucinations while OPT appears capable of internal encoding. The scanning method performs comparably to an out-of-distribution classifier despite no prior exposure to anomalies. The ability to identify pivotal nodes could inform fine-tuning of sub-networks for bias mitigation. Overall, this unsupervised approach enables auditing pre-trained LLMs for harmful biases without needing access to labeled anomalous data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a weakly supervised method to audit pre-trained language models by scanning their internal activations to detect if they are encoding anomalous patterns like hallucinations or stereotypes, without needing explicit labels or prior knowledge of the specific biases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an auditing method to identify whether a large language model (LLM) encodes anomalous patterns such as hallucinations or biases in its internal states. Specifically:

- They introduce a weakly supervised technique using subset scanning to detect anomalous patterns in LLM activations from pre-trained models, without needing explicit knowledge or labels of the anomaly types.

- They propose two extensions to handle cases where LLM embeddings for anomalous sentences may deviate in either direction from the expected distribution. 

- Their method shows comparable performance to a fully supervised classifier in detecting hallucinations, without requiring any prior exposure to or labels of false statements during training.

- They discuss how their approach could potentially inform fine-tuning of subnetworks in LLMs as a bias mitigation strategy, by identifying pivotal nodes responsible for encoding the anomalous patterns.

In summary, the key contribution is a practical auditing technique to identify the presence of unknown biases encoded in LLMs' internal representations, using only reference data assumed to be devoid of anomalies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Hallucinations
- Bias detection
- Anomaly detection 
- Subset scanning
- Weakly supervised learning
- Activations
- Empirical p-values
- Nodes
- Fine-tuning
- Bias mitigation

The paper proposes using a weakly supervised subset scanning approach to detect biases like hallucinations in the activations of pre-trained LLMs, without needing access to labeled data containing those biases. It introduces methods to scan left-tailed, right-tailed, and two-tailed p-values derived from activations to identify anomalous sentences and pivotal nodes. The paper also discusses how identifying important nodes could inform fine-tuning of subnetworks for bias mitigation. So the key ideas focus on anomaly detection in LLM activations, subset scanning, weak supervision, and using results to potentially guide bias mitigation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces two new scanning methods, \scanlr and \scantwo, to handle activations that may deviate in either direction from the expected distribution. Could you elaborate on the motivation and implementation details of these two methods? How do they complement each other? 

2. The paper argues that using non-parametric scan statistics makes minimal assumptions about the distribution of activations. Could you discuss the limitations of relying on parametric assumptions in this context and the benefits of using a non-parametric approach?

3. When using the Higher Criticism test statistic for the scoring function, the paper notes it tends to yield smaller subsets characterized by wider ranges of p-values. Could you explain the rationale behind this in more detail? How does this relate to the typically small quantity of anomalous data?

4. The paper introduces an iterative optimization process using the Fast Generalized Subset Scanning algorithm. Could you walk through this algorithm and how it increases efficiency? What is the role of the LTSS property?  

5. In the comparison of results between BERT and OPT, the paper indicates OPT may have greater capacity for encoding hallucinations internally. What evidence from the results supports this conclusion? How might the architectures differ to explain this?

6. The paper argues the method enables more data-efficient anomaly detection than training a classifier. Could you analyze this claim in more depth and discuss any caveats? What assumptions need to be met?

7. One discussion point is using the subset of identified nodes to inform fine-tuning. Could you propose some potential fine-tuning strategies leveraging these nodes? How might the objectives differ based on the type of bias?

8. The paper notes limitations in generalizing some prior methods to detect unknown biases. How does the proposed approach aim to address this? What provisions allow for unbiased sentence classification? 

9. The comparison of empirical p-values between clean and anomalous data provides motivation for the method. Could you further analyze these distributions and how deviations detect anomalies? Are limitations depending on activation distributions?

10. The paper focuses the analysis on later encoder layers. What is the rationale behind this? Could earlier layers also provide indications of bias encoding? What might results suggest if scanning earlier layers?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT have shown impressive capabilities but also risk perpetuating biases and harmful content. 
- Prior auditing methods often assume knowledge of specific bias types a priori and require labeled anomalous data for training. Obtaining sufficient labeled data can be challenging and stressful for human annotators.  
- The goal is to detect if an LLM is internally encoding anomalous patterns like hallucinations or stereotypes, which may propagate downstream, without needing labels.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a weakly supervised deep subset scanning approach to identify anomalous subsets of nodes and sentences from LLM activations using only a reference dataset of normal examples. 
- Derive empirical p-values from activations to quantify deviation from reference distribution. Uniform p-values are expected for normal data.
- Propose two extensions: (1) Union of left-tail and right-tail scan results (2) Iterative top-k two-tailed scan.
- Identify pivotal nodes responsible for encoding anomalies to inform efficient sub-network fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- Weakly supervised auditing method to detect unknown anomaly types in LLMs without needing labels. Comparable performance to supervised classifier.
- Handles deviations in both directions using left/right tail unions and top-k scans. 
- Confirm OPT but not BERT encodes hallucinations internally, suggesting OPT generates while BERT mainly propagates anomalies.
- Identified subsets of sentences and pivotal nodes enable guiding efficient sub-network fine-tuning for bias mitigation.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable auditing technique to detect biases in LLMs and identify components to improve via fine-tuning. The approach is label-efficient and flexibly handles anomalous patterns.
