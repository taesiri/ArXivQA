# [Improving Cross-lingual Representation for Semantic Retrieval with   Code-switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic retrieval (SR) is important for FAQ systems in task-oriented QA dialog systems, but existing methods have limitations:
    - They ignore providing signals related to downstream SR task during pre-training. 
    - They are pre-trained on monolingual data lacking code-switched sentences common in user queries.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel pre-training approach using code-switched cross-lingual data to address limitations:
    - Pre-train transformer model jointly using weighted sum of Alternating Language Modeling (ALM) loss on code-switched data and similarity loss between query and label embeddings.
    - Provides signals related to similarity between query and labels during pre-training.
    - Uses code-switching data to better handle user queries.

- Steps:
    1. Generate code-switched training data using bilingual dictionaries. 
    2. Pre-train model as described above.
    3. Fine-tune on SR corpus.

Main Contributions:
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SR and STS across 20+ languages on business and open datasets.
- Improves model robustness for sentence-level SR.  
- First to utilize code-switching approach for cross-lingual SR to address limitations of existing methods.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel pre-training method using code-switching and similarity loss to provide better signals for downstream SR task. It shows state-of-the-art performance on semantic retrieval across many languages and datasets. The use of code-switching is a novel technique to handle user queries better.
