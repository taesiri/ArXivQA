## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Dynamic scene reconstruction is an important task for applications like 3D animation and virtual/augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a fast alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for this task. However, existing dynamic 3DGS methods focus mainly on extending the static 3DGS temporally, while overlooking the rich motion information in 2D observations. This leads to performance degradation, visual overfitting, and redundant modeling. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel motion-aware framework to enhance dynamic 3DGS reconstruction using optical flow supervision. The key ideas are:

1) Establish correspondence between 3D Gaussian motions and 2D optical flows for direct supervision. A foreground Gaussian searching and reprojection strategy is used instead of render-based flow to make this more robust. 

2) Introduce an uncertainty-aware flow loss to align predicted and ground-truth flows. The loss adapts to uncertainty in flow prediction and inconsistencies between pixel-level flow and Gaussian motions.

3) Offer dynamic awareness to color/regularization losses using the flow map as an attention mechanism. This guides optimization to focus more on dynamic regions.

4) For deformation-based 3DGS, propose a transient-aware deformation auxiliary module to inject instantaneous motion information into Gaussian features. This resolves motion ambiguities in relative deformation optimization.

The framework is evaluated on both multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes, where it shows superior performance over baselines.

Main Contributions:
- First work to systematically exploit optical flow cues to enhance dynamic 3DGS reconstruction 
- Effective flow-based motion awareness strategies for both iterative and deformation-based 3DGS paradigms
- Demonstrates improved efficiency and accuracy in modeling dynamic scenes
