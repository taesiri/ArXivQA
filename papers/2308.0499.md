# [Stochastic Geometry Based Modeling and Analysis on Network NOMA in   Downlink CoMP Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question addressed in this paper is: How to model and analyze the performance of network NOMA (N-NOMA) in a downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) system, where multiple base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve a cell-edge user (CoMP user) while also serving additional cell-center users (NOMA users) by using the same time/frequency resource?Specifically, the key aspects of the research question are:- Applying stochastic geometry tools to model the random locations of BSs and users in the network. - Deriving analytical expressions for the outage probabilities achieved by the CoMP user and NOMA users under this setup.- Evaluating the performance of N-NOMA and comparing it with conventional OMA-based CoMP schemes.So in summary, the main research contribution is using stochastic geometry to model and analyze the performance of downlink N-NOMA in CoMP systems, considering the impact of spatial randomness and interference. The results provide insights into the benefits of N-NOMA over OMA in improving spectral efficiency for cell-edge users.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based analysis of network non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) in downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems. The key contributions are:- It applies Poisson cluster process (PCP) to model the random locations of base stations (BSs) and users. This generalizes the analysis compared to prior work that only considered a fixed number of BSs. - It derives analytical expressions for the outage probabilities achieved by both the CoMP user and NOMA users by characterizing the distributions of the channel gains from multiple cooperating BSs. The analysis accounts for interference from the entire network.- It shows that N-NOMA can significantly improve the outage sum rate compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based CoMP, at the cost of slightly worse outage probability for the CoMP user.- The accuracy of the analysis can be controlled by choosing suitable approximation parameters. This allows system designers to conveniently evaluate performance trends without extensive simulations.In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive stochastic geometry framework to analyze the performance of N-NOMA in downlink CoMP systems with random topology. The key novelty is the analysis for arbitrary number of cooperating BSs and accounting for aggregate network interference.
