# [Stochastic Geometry Based Modeling and Analysis on Network NOMA in   Downlink CoMP Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question addressed in this paper is: 

How to model and analyze the performance of network NOMA (N-NOMA) in a downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) system, where multiple base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve a cell-edge user (CoMP user) while also serving additional cell-center users (NOMA users) by using the same time/frequency resource?

Specifically, the key aspects of the research question are:

- Applying stochastic geometry tools to model the random locations of BSs and users in the network. 

- Deriving analytical expressions for the outage probabilities achieved by the CoMP user and NOMA users under this setup.

- Evaluating the performance of N-NOMA and comparing it with conventional OMA-based CoMP schemes.

So in summary, the main research contribution is using stochastic geometry to model and analyze the performance of downlink N-NOMA in CoMP systems, considering the impact of spatial randomness and interference. The results provide insights into the benefits of N-NOMA over OMA in improving spectral efficiency for cell-edge users.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based analysis of network non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) in downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems. The key contributions are:

- It applies Poisson cluster process (PCP) to model the random locations of base stations (BSs) and users. This generalizes the analysis compared to prior work that only considered a fixed number of BSs. 

- It derives analytical expressions for the outage probabilities achieved by both the CoMP user and NOMA users by characterizing the distributions of the channel gains from multiple cooperating BSs. The analysis accounts for interference from the entire network.

- It shows that N-NOMA can significantly improve the outage sum rate compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based CoMP, at the cost of slightly worse outage probability for the CoMP user.

- The accuracy of the analysis can be controlled by choosing suitable approximation parameters. This allows system designers to conveniently evaluate performance trends without extensive simulations.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive stochastic geometry framework to analyze the performance of N-NOMA in downlink CoMP systems with random topology. The key novelty is the analysis for arbitrary number of cooperating BSs and accounting for aggregate network interference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on analyzing network NOMA (N-NOMA) in downlink CoMP systems using stochastic geometry. Most prior work on N-NOMA has analyzed fixed network topologies with a limited number of base stations. Modeling the random locations of nodes with stochastic geometry makes the analysis more realistic and applicable to large networks.

- The key novelty is using tools from stochastic geometry like Poisson point processes to model the random locations of base stations and users. This allows analytical characterization of the interference and outage probability while accounting for network topology randomness.

- Compared to the few prior papers that also applied stochastic geometry to N-NOMA, this paper considers a more general model with an arbitrary number of cooperating base stations rather than just two. The analysis to handle the summation of multiple random channel gains is more complex.

- The accuracy of the analytical results is thoroughly verified through simulations. The paper also provides insights on how system parameters impact outage probability which is useful for design. 

- Limitations are that it considers a simplified single-antenna model. Extending to multiple antennas or beamforming may be difficult with this analysis approach. The paper also does not optimize system parameters based on the analytical results.

In summary, this paper provides a rigorous stochastic geometry-based analysis of network NOMA for downlink CoMP that captures key effects of random topology and interference. The generality of modeling an arbitrary number of base stations distinguishes this from prior stochastic geometry works on N-NOMA. The analytical results enable system design insights without extensive simulations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Consider the impact of limited fronthaul/backhaul capacity on the performance analysis. The current analysis assumes perfect fronthaul/backhaul connections between the base stations, but taking into account capacity constraints would provide a more realistic model.

- Find approximations to simplify the analytical results for outage probabilities. The authors note the complexity of the derived expressions makes it challenging to optimize parameters like R_D and Î»_c. Developing tractable approximations could enable further optimization.

- Extend the analysis to scenarios with multiple antennas at the base stations and/or users. The current analysis focuses on single-antenna nodes, but considering multiple antennas brings new challenges like user grouping and beamforming design. 

- Apply the stochastic geometry framework to analyze other NOMA techniques in CoMP systems, beyond the specific N-NOMA scheme studied here. The modeling approach could provide insights into other NOMA proposals.

- Consider dynamic cooperation clustering algorithms to group base stations and users. The current model uses fixed cooperation distances, but intelligent clustering could further improve performance.

- Study the impact of imperfect CSI on the outage performance analysis. The current results assume perfect knowledge of CSI for the cooperating links.

- Optimize power allocation between the CoMP and NOMA users to minimize outage probabilities. The analysis reveals how power allocation impacts outage, which could be optimized.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: 1) add more realism to the model, 2) simplify the analytical results, 3) expand to more general scenarios, and 4) devise intelligent algorithms for user clustering and resource allocation. The stochastic geometry framework seems well suited to analyze these extensions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Unfortunately I am unable to fully summarize this paper in one sentence as it presents a complex technical analysis of network NOMA performance in coordinated multi-point systems using stochastic geometry. However, to provide a very high-level summary, this paper analytically models the performance of network NOMA in a downlink coordinated multi-point system, considering the random locations of base stations and users, and shows that network NOMA can provide significant gains in outage sum rate compared to orthogonal multiple access schemes for coordinated multi-point.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the performance of network non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) in a downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) system. The authors model the locations of base stations (BSs) and users using stochastic geometry. Specifically, they apply a Poisson cluster process model where the BSs form the parent process and the users form clusters around each BS. The key idea of N-NOMA is that when multiple BSs cooperatively serve a cell-edge user (CoMP user), each BS can simultaneously serve additional cell-center users (NOMA users) by using the same resource block allocated to the CoMP user. The authors derive analytical expressions for the outage probabilities achieved by the CoMP and NOMA users while considering interference from the entire network. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis and show that N-NOMA provides superior outage sum rate compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes for CoMP, at the cost of slightly higher outage for the CoMP user. Overall, the paper provides useful insights into the performance of N-NOMA in CoMP systems with random topology.
