# [Safety-critical Control of Quadrupedal Robots with Rolling Arms for   Autonomous Inspection of Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quadrupedal robots have potential to perform inspection and maintenance tasks in industrial facilities with multiple tiers or levels (e.g. distillation columns). However, safely transitioning between levels and locomoting within confined spaces in these environments poses unique challenges.

- Existing quadruped control frameworks lack capabilities to: (1) generate trajectories for seamless transitions between levels, (2) ensure safety via foothold re-planning and control methods, (3) modulate gaits based on danger levels.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a layered control architecture tailored for a quadruped robot with a roller arm operating in multi-tiered environments. 

- Key components of the framework include:
  (1) Trajectory optimization to enable stable transitions between levels.
  (2) Safety-critical control using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to modify locomotion path.
  (3) Foothold re-planning method to adjust footstep locations to avoid unsafe regions.
  (4) CBF-based gait transitions between trotting and quasi-static walking based on proximity to danger.
  (5) Low-level control incorporating full robot dynamics and contact constraints.

- Ellipse-shaped CBFs are designed to encode safety constraints and trigger gait transitions.

- Components validated on quadruped hardware in experiments involving transitions through a column tray and safety-critical locomotion near a manway.

Main Contributions:
- Optimization-based method for generating trajectories for seamless and stable transitions between column levels.

- Unified control framework integrating CBF-based locomotion control, foothold re-planning, gait transitions and low-level control.

- Use of multiple CBFs to modulate gaits based on danger levels in addition to ensuring safe navigation.

- Experimental validation of quadruped locomoting safely via foothold adjustments and gait transitions within an actual industry-grade confined environment.
