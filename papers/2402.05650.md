# [Rocks Coding, Not Development--A Human-Centric, Experimental Evaluation   of LLM-Supported SE Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Recent claims state that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can replace human software developers, but there is little empirical evidence on their actual capability in fulfilling software engineering tasks.  

- It is unclear whether and to what extent developers can benefit from working with tools like ChatGPT, and how their workflows and interactions would be impacted.

Methodology:
- The authors conducted a controlled experiment with 109 developer participants. 

- There were two tasks - solving coding puzzles, and a more realistic bug-fixing task. Participants were randomly assigned to complete one of the tasks with or without ChatGPT. 

- Quantitative metrics like efficiency, solution quality and task load were measured. Interactions with ChatGPT were also qualitatively analyzed.

Key Findings:
- For coding puzzles, working with ChatGPT improved efficiency but not necessarily solution quality. For the bug-fixing task, no significant efficiency or quality gains were observed.

- Participants showed rich interaction dynamics with ChatGPT - some struggling, some treating it as a "life saver", others engaging it in back-and-forth discussion.

- Overall, the results rebut the claim that LLMs can replace developers. There is potential, but more research is needed on designing interactions and collaborations between humans and LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- First empirical study evaluating LLM capability in fulfilling SE tasks, through a controlled experiment
- Characterization of how developers interact with LLMs, revealing rich dynamics 
- Discussion of implications for SE research, practice, and education in the age of LLMs

In summary, this rigorous human-centric study demonstrates the promises and limits of LLMs like ChatGPT in software engineering, and motivates more research into human-AI collaboration.
