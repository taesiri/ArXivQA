# [PromptCap: Prompt-Guided Task-Aware Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09699)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we develop an image captioning model that generates more informative captions tailored to answering visual questions, to serve as an effective interface between images and knowledge-based question answering systems? The key hypothesis is that using a natural language prompt to control what visual information the captioning model describes can help it generate captions better suited for visual QA, compared to generic image captions. The paper proposes PromptCap, a novel prompt-guided captioning model, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving performance on knowledge-based VQA tasks when used with large language models like GPT-3.In summary, the paper focuses on improving the image-to-text conversion step for visual QA by developing a controllable captioning model that describes visual details relevant to answering the question, guided by a natural language prompt. This allows large pretrained language models to leverage the image information better for knowledge-based reasoning.
