# [PromptCap: Prompt-Guided Task-Aware Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09699)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:

How can we develop an image captioning model that generates more informative captions tailored to answering visual questions, to serve as an effective interface between images and knowledge-based question answering systems? 

The key hypothesis is that using a natural language prompt to control what visual information the captioning model describes can help it generate captions better suited for visual QA, compared to generic image captions. The paper proposes PromptCap, a novel prompt-guided captioning model, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving performance on knowledge-based VQA tasks when used with large language models like GPT-3.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving the image-to-text conversion step for visual QA by developing a controllable captioning model that describes visual details relevant to answering the question, guided by a natural language prompt. This allows large pretrained language models to leverage the image information better for knowledge-based reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing PromptCap, a novel question-aware image captioning model that generates captions conditioned on a natural language prompt containing the question to be answered. This allows the model to describe visual details relevant to answering the question.

2. A method to train PromptCap without additional annotations by synthesizing training examples with GPT-3 via few-shot in-context learning. The examples are filtered to ensure high quality.

3. Demonstrating that PromptCap enables GPT-3 to achieve state-of-the-art results on knowledge-based VQA datasets like OK-VQA and A-OKVQA through an in-context learning pipeline. Experiments show consistent gains over generic image captions.

4. Evaluating PromptCap's generalization ability on the WebQA dataset, where it outperforms generic captions and supervised baselines without any training on WebQA's compositional questions and different image domain.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing PromptCap, a novel question-aware captioning model, along with a method to train it without extra annotations. PromptCap is shown to act as an effective module for converting visual information into text tailored to answering questions, boosting performance of large LMs on VQA tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review, the main point of the paper seems to be introducing a new question-aware image captioning model called PromptCap that is designed to work with black-box language models like GPT-3 for visual question answering. The key ideas are using a natural language prompt to control the visual content described in the generated caption, and training the model without extra annotations by synthesizing examples with GPT-3. The overall claim is that PromptCap serves as a better connector between images and language models compared to generic image captions, enabling improved performance on knowledge-based VQA tasks when combined with GPT-3 in-context learning.

In one sentence, the TL;DR summary would be: The paper proposes PromptCap, a question-aware image captioning model trained via GPT-3 synthesized data, to improve visual question answering with black-box language models.
