# [Exploring the Impact of Lay User Feedback for Improving AI Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08064)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores methods for integrating lay user feedback to improve the fairness of AI models, using a case study of a loan application prediction model. The authors conducted a user study where 58 participants provided labels marking loan application decisions as fair or unfair, and adjusted feature weights. They proposed approaches to integrate this feedback into retraining an XGBoost model and evaluated impacts on common individual and group fairness metrics. Key findings were that integrating all users' unfairness labels improved certain group fairness metrics related to protected attributes, but individual fairness metrics and accuracy declined. Investigating individual models showed participants focused on improving fairness for certain attributes while deteriorating it for others. Analysis of user interactions revealed they adjusted weights for non-protected attributes potentially indicating other fairness notions. Overall, the paper demonstrates feasibility of leveraging user feedback for AI fairness but highlights challenges around conflicting user perspectives on fairness, choice of metrics, and integration approaches. It provides an open dataset and code to enable further research on interactive and human-centered techniques for developing fair AI systems.
