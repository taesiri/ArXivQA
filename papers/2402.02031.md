# [Multi-fidelity physics constrained neural networks for dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Conventional physics-constrained neural networks (PCNNs) suffer from high computational complexity when imposing physical constraints, as this needs to happen in the high-dimensional physical space. Also, PCNNs cannot effectively utilize multi-fidelity data due to fixed neural network input sizes.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Multi-Scale Physics-Constrained Neural Network (MSPCNN) that leverages a multi-fidelity autoencoder to map data across fidelities into a shared latent space. This allows imposing physical constraints in a low-fidelity space, reducing computational burden. Also, the model can utilize both high-fidelity and low-fidelity data for training.

Key Contributions:

1) A multi-fidelity autoencoder that maps high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into the same latent space, enabling flexible mapping across fidelities.

2) Imposing physical constraints in the low-fidelity space decoded from the latent space instead of the high-fidelity space, reducing computational complexity.

3) Ability to leverage both high-fidelity and low-fidelity data for model training due to the shared latent space, reducing data dependence.

4) Demonstrated superior performance over PCNNs in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise on test cases of 2D Burgers' equation and shallow water equations. Achieved 60-80% of PCNN performance with only 25-50% of training time.

5) Showcased importance of multiple physical constraints instead of just one when modeling complex physics. Constraints complement each other in enhancing prediction accuracy.

In summary, the proposed MSPCNN offers an efficient and flexible framework for multifidelity modelling of complex dynamical systems with physical constraints. Key innovation is mapping fidelities into a shared space and imposing constraints in a computationally cheaper, low-fidelity space.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Multi-Scale Physics-Constrained Neural Network (MSPCNN) that leverages a multi-fidelity autoencoder to map data across fidelities into a shared latent space, allowing predictive models to be trained on multi-fidelity data while evaluating physical constraints at lower fidelities to enhance efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel physics-constrained machine learning model called Multi-Scale Physics-Constrained Neural Network (MSPCNN). This model can incorporate data with different levels of fidelity into a unified latent space through a customized multi-fidelity autoencoder. It also allows evaluating physical constraints within low-fidelity spaces to achieve a trade-off between training efficiency and accuracy.

2. MSPCNN manages to employ multi-fidelity data to train the predictive model, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that can only handle single-fidelity data. 

3. Compared to physics-constrained neural networks without multi-scale capabilities, MSPCNN demonstrates significantly improved prediction accuracy (at least 50% MSE reduction) and noise robustness when introducing physical constraints in low-fidelity fields.

4. In terms of training time, MSPCNN exhibits remarkable reductions compared to imposing constraints in high-fidelity fields, ranging from half to a quarter of the original computation time.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of MSPCNN, a novel multi-scale physics-constrained neural network that can leverage multi-fidelity data and low-fidelity physical constraints to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
