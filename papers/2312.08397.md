# [Personalized Decision Supports based on Theory of Mind Modeling and   Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing decision support systems (DSS) face two major challenges - lack of personalization and explainability. DSS need to account for individual differences and provide transparent reasoning to gain human trust. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a novel DSS that combines theory of mind (ToM) modeling and explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) to provide personalized and interpretable interventions. 

- A pre-trained deep RL agent provides expert action recommendations. 
- A Bayesian network-based ToM model estimates human mental states and predicts future actions to identify situations needing intervention.
- Counterfactual explanations from the RL agent reveal feature importance for local decisions. 
- Explanations also consider the ToM model structure to personalize interventions.

Experiments: The system was evaluated in a simulated search and rescue task with crowd-sourced participants.

Results:
- The ToM model accurately predicted human actions for personalization.
- Participants with ToM + XRL interventions had significantly higher task performance. 
- Interventions achieved high short-term compliance rates. ToM modeling further improved long-term compliance.

Main Contributions:
- Novel integration of ToM and XRL for personalized and interpretable DSS.
- Evaluated explainable RL interventions in human subject experiments.  
- Demonstrated ToM modeling enhances intervention effectiveness.
- Proposed system is generalizable to different tasks and RL models.

In summary, this paper presents an innovative approach to address key limitations of existing DSS by leveraging computational modeling of human behavior and eXplainable AI methods. The experiments confirm the utility of this system in improving human decision-making.
