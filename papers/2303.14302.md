# [VILA: Learning Image Aesthetics from User Comments with Vision-Language   Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14302)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How can we effectively learn image aesthetics from noisy but abundant image-comment pairs, and transfer the learned knowledge to enhance performance on image aesthetic assessment (IAA) tasks?

The key points are:

- Existing IAA methods rely on human-labeled datasets with rating scores, which lack contextual information on why an image is aesthetically pleasing or not. 

- User comments on photo sharing websites provide more natural free-form aesthetic information, but are noisy. 

- The authors propose a vision-language learning framework called VILA to leverage image-comment pairs. It contains:

1) VILA-P: Pretraining a vision-language model on image-comment pairs to learn aesthetics knowledge.

2) VILA-R: A lightweight rank-based adapter to efficiently adapt the pretrained model to score-based IAA tasks.

- By pretraining on image-comments, their model captures richer aesthetics concepts compared to models pretrained on generic image-text data. 

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art IAA performance on the AVA dataset. It also shows strong zero-shot transfer learning ability for aesthetic tasks like style classification and quality assessment.

In summary, the main research question is how to effectively utilize noisy but informative image-comment pairs, in order to learn rich aesthetic knowledge that can transfer to downstream IAA tasks. The proposed VILA framework provides a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel two-stage vision-language aesthetics (VILA) learning framework for learning image aesthetics from user comments. The key contributions are:

1. Proposing to use image-comment pairs for vision-language pretraining to learn rich aesthetic representations without human labels (VILA-P). This is the first work to explore image-comment pretraining for aesthetics.

2. Designing a lightweight rank-based adapter module (VILA-R) that can efficiently adapt the pretrained model to image aesthetic assessment (IAA) by learning relative aesthetic rankings with minimal additional parameters.

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on IAA over the AVA dataset. The pretrained VILA model also shows strong zero-shot transfer learning capabilities on tasks like aesthetic style classification and comment generation.

4. Highlighting the potential of leveraging raw user comments for learning open-set aesthetic concepts, significantly reducing the need for human labeled aesthetic data.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel vision-language pretraining framework for aesthetics learning, which leverages image-comment pairs to learn rich aesthetic representations. The proposed rank-based adapter allows efficient adaptation to IAA while retaining the versatile pretrained weights.
