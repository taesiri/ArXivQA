# [Scaling Learning based Policy Optimization for Temporal Tasks via   Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training neural network (NN) feedback controllers to satisfy complex spatio-temporal specifications faces challenges with vanishing/exploding gradients, especially for long time horizons.
- Existing methods for using signal temporal logic (STL) robustness as training objectives also do not scale well. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a dropout-inspired sampling technique to approximate gradients only over select time steps. This helps alleviate vanishing/exploding gradient issues.
- Incorporate the notion of "critical predicates" from STL robustness computation to guide effective time step sampling.
- Propose a new differentiable underapproximation for STL robustness ("LBFORTL") that scales better than prior smooth semantics.

Contributions:
- Sampling-based gradient approximation technique to enable training on long time horizon tasks. Shows order of magnitude speedups.
- Leverage structure of STL specification and critical predicates to guide time step sampling.
- New smooth semantics LBFORTL that lower bounds STL robustness and scales better for complex specifications.
- Demonstrate technique on high-dimensional quadrotors and multi-agent systems with thousands of time steps.
- Compare LBFORTL performance to other semantics. Shows significantly improved training times.
- Provide intuition for preference of NN feedback controllers over open-loop controllers.
- Perform statistical verification of trained controllers.

In summary, the paper develops a novel time sampling approach to scale training of neural network controllers for complex and long time horizon STL tasks. This is enabled by a new differentiable semantics and exploits the structure of STL specifications.
