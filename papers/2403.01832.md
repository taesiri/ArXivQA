# [Model-Based Data-Centric AI: Bridging the Divide Between Academic Ideals   and Industrial Pragmatism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a divergence between academic and industrial perspectives on "good data" for developing AI models. Academia focuses on creating benchmark datasets for fair comparison across models, while industry prioritizes curating data that optimizes performance for specific applications.  

- Academic data standards often do not meet the more rigorous demands of industrial deployment. Benchmark datasets lack real-world complexity and model-specific instances needed to drive substantial improvements.

- Dominant data-centric AI paradigms fail to account for the dynamic interaction between data and models. Data curation remains model-agnostic rather than integrating model-specific insights.

Proposed Solution:
- Shift from model-agnostic data curation to "Model-Based Data-Centric AI". This new paradigm integrates model considerations directly into the data optimization process.

- Incorporate approach-specific information beyond just task-specific data to provide additional supervisory signals (e.g. indexing in extractive QA).

- Use downstream model performance to guide and evaluate the quality of synthetic data generation. Allows creating data that targets model weaknesses.

- Adopt industrial standards emphasizing iterative data cleansing, comprehensive metadata, automation and cost-effectiveness. Ensures adaptability to evolving real-world needs.

Main Contributions:
- Highlights divergence between academic and industrial notions of "good data" based on priorities of theoretical utility vs. practical deployment.

- Critiques current data-centric AI for overlooking model-specific data requirements needed for performance gains. 

- Proposes Model-Based Data-Centric AI to bridge gap by incorporating model insights into data curation.

- Underscores need for industrial data standards valuing automation, metadata and continual dataset evolution.

- Aims to spur collaboration between academia and industry to enhance real-world applicability of AI innovations.
