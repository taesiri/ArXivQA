# [WHAC: World-grounded Humans and Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recovering 3D human poses and shapes as well as camera motions from monocular videos is an important but challenging task, especially when the camera is moving. Existing methods typically estimate expressive parametric human models (e.g. SMPL-X) in the camera coordinate system, lacking global spatial information. The estimated camera trajectories are also "scaleless". This paper aims to address these issues by recovering both humans and cameras with accurate scales jointly in the world coordinate system.

Method: 
The paper proposes WHAC, a novel framework that synergizes modeling of human-camera, camera-world and human-world interactions. It first runs an off-the-shelf expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) model to obtain camera-frame SMPL-X parameters. Although not supervised on depth estimation, these parameters already reflect reasonable human depths. The paper then introduces a MotionVelocimeter module that leverages inherent spatial cues in human motions to estimate human root velocity and global trajectory with absolute scale. By transferring this scale information to the visual odometry estimated camera trajectory, WHAC can recover both human and camera trajectories in the world coordinate system accurately.

Contributions:
1) WHAC pioneers optimization-free, whole-body modeling for jointly estimating expressive humans and cameras with global scales.

2) A new dataset WHAC-A-Mole is introduced, which features accurate SMPL-X and camera annotations for diverse human-human interactions under automatic cinematic camera motions.

3) Extensive experiments show WHAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream EHPS benchmarks and the newly proposed dataset. It also demonstrates surprising capability in resolving difficult cases where motion and camera cues contradict each other.

In summary, by capitalizing on the synergies between humans, cameras and the environment, WHAC effectively addresses the scale ambiguity issues in monocular human and camera modeling tasks. The new dataset also facilitates further research in this direction.
