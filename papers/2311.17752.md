# [BAND-2k: Banding Artifact Noticeable Database for Banding Detection and   Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17752)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces BAND-2k, the largest image quality assessment database focused on banding artifacts, consisting of 2,000 banding images generated by 15 compression and quantization schemes. A comprehensive subjective study with 23 subjects was conducted to obtain over 214,000 patch-level banding labels and 44,371 reliable quality scores. The paper also proposes a novel no-reference banding evaluator that leverages frequency characteristics to detect banding by using a dual CNN architecture applied on high-frequency and low-frequency maps. Spatial frequency masking refines the banding visibility prediction. Without regression, the banding scores from the detected maps have high rank correlation to human scores. Experiments validate the banding detection accuracy and quality prediction performance surpassing SOTA methods. The usefulness of the database and evaluator are demonstrated for developing pre/post-processing debanding algorithms and optimizing streaming media quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new banding image quality assessment method and database called BAND-2k with 2,000 banding images generated by 15 compression schemes, over 214,000 patch labels, and 44,371 subjective quality scores, which uses a dual CNN architecture on frequency maps and spatial frequency masking to effectively detect banding artifacts and predict perceptual image quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors construct the largest ecologically valid banding image quality assessment (IQA) database to date named BAND-2k. It contains 2,000 banding distorted images with subjective quality scores collected from 23 subjects.

2. The authors propose a novel no-reference banding evaluator for banding detection and quality assessment. It utilizes a dual-branch CNN architecture to extract hierarchical features from high-frequency maps and low-frequency maps of image patches. A spatial frequency masking strategy is introduced to refine the banding detection map.

3. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method on banding detection and banding IQA tasks. The strong correlation between the predicted quality scores and mean opinion scores validates the effectiveness of the proposed banding evaluator.

In summary, the key contribution is the construction of a large-scale banding database BAND-2k and an effective deep learning based banding evaluator using frequency characteristics of banding artifacts. The database and evaluator enable further research and development of banding detection and quality assessment algorithms.

The paper focuses on constructing a large-scale banding image quality assessment (IQA) database called BAND-2k with 2,000 banding images and over 214,000 patch-level labels. It also proposes an effective no-reference banding evaluator for banding detection and quality assessment. The proposed method leverages frequency characteristics of banding artifacts and uses a dual-branch CNN architecture to extract hierarchical features. A spatial frequency masking strategy is also introduced to refine banding visibility maps. The experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in banding detection and correlation with perceptual quality scores. So the key terms reflect this focus on banding IQA, database creation, no-reference methods, frequency analysis, CNN architectures, and perceptual quality modeling.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a dual-CNN model with two parallel branches that take the high-frequency map (HFM) and low-frequency map (LFM) of an image patch as inputs. Why is this dual architecture beneficial compared to using only a single branch? How do the HFM and LFM provide complementary information?

2. Spatial frequency masking is used to refine the detected banding map before pooling to obtain a final banding quality score. Explain the rationale behind using spatial frequency for weighting the banding visibility map. How does this relate to the contrast sensitivity of the human visual system?

3. The paper demonstrates superior performance over other blind IQA methods like DBCNN and HyperIQA on the banding image quality assessment task. What intrinsic differences between banding and other distortions explain why these methods underperform, despite good results on databases with generic distortions?

4. The subjective study uses a continuous rating scale from 0-100, with higher scores indicating more visible/severe banding. What were some considerations in choosing this rating methodology compared to discrete categorical scales? How was the scale anchored?

5. The paper constructs an image patch classification dataset with binary banding/non-banding labels. What was the rationale behind the 30% overlap threshold used to determine if a patch should be labeled as banded? How might this threshold impact model training?  

6. The ablation experimentsanalyze variants with single branches and different input combinations. What do these results reveal about how the HFM and LFM provide complementary information? When would using just the original banding images as input be insufficient?

7. The paper demonstrates cross-database generalization ability between the BAND-2k dataset and the one from Kapoor et al. What differences between these two databases posed challenges for cross-database evaluation?

8. The constructed BAND-2k database contains more compression schemes (H.264, H.265, VP9, bit-depth manipulation) than previous banding datasets. How does this enhanced diversity benefit algorithm development and benchmarking?

9. The proposed banding assessment method operates in a no-reference setting. How feasible would it be to extend this approach to a reduced-reference scenario where partial original image information is available? What challenges would need to be addressed?

10. The paper states that banding quality correlates with the coverage and intensity of banding contours. Qualitatively, how does the appearance of banding artifacts at different intensities and spatial densities impact the perceived image quality and user QoE?
