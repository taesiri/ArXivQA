# [A novel feature selection method based on quantum support vector machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17646)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel quantum feature selection method called Quantum Support Vector Machine Feature Selection (QSVMF) that integrates quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). QSVMF employs five simultaneous fitness objectives during optimization: maximizing classification accuracy, minimizing quantum gate costs of the feature map circuit, minimizing selected feature covariance, and separately minimizing local and non-local gate costs. By applying QSVMF for breast cancer classification, the method selects superior feature subsets compared to classical SelectKBest, achieving higher accuracy SVM models. Examining the Pareto front trade-offs shows QSVMF can identify extremely sparse yet accurate feature sets of 1-3 features. While compact, these tiny feature subsets maintain accuracy over 75%, demonstrating QSVMF's effectiveness at eliminating redundant variables. The features chosen also align with known imaging biomarkers for breast cancer. Overall, results highlight the potential of quantum computing to enhance machine learning via more informative feature selection, reduced dimensionality, and interpretability. Further analysis on diverse datasets is warranted to fully characterize when quantum techniques offer advantages over classical methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new quantum machine learning method called Quantum Support Vector Machine Feature Selection (QSVMF) that integrates quantum support vector machines with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to perform feature selection by simultaneously optimizing for maximized classification accuracy and minimized gate costs, selected features, and feature covariance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new feature selection method called quantum support vector machine feature selection (QSVMF). QSVMF integrates quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for feature selection. The key innovations of QSVMF include:

1) Using five simultaneous fitness objectives during optimization: maximizing classification accuracy, minimizing quantum gate costs, minimizing feature count, minimizing feature covariance, and balancing local and non-local gates. 

2) Applying QSVMF for feature selection on a breast cancer dataset and showing it can identify superior feature subsets compared to classical methods like SelectKBest, leading to higher accuracy models.

3) Analyzing the Pareto front tradeoffs between accuracy and number of features to identify very compact yet accurate feature subsets, highlighting QSVMF's ability to effectively eliminate redundant features.

4) Conceptualizing the biological relevance of the imaging features selected by QSVMF in terms of known morphological indicators for breast cancer diagnosis.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing QSVMF as a new quantum-enabled feature selection technique that integrates QSVMs with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize multiple criteria related to model accuracy, complexity and interpretability during feature selection. Experiments on a real-world medical dataset showcase QSVMF's capabilities.
