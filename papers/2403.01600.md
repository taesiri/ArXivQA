# [Can Poverty Be Reduced by Acting on Discrimination? An Agent-based Model   for Policy Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Poverty reduction rates have slowed down globally, suggesting that traditional redistributive policies may be losing effectiveness. Alternative insights are needed to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty. Recent research has highlighted discrimination against the poor, known as "aporophobia", as a potential impediment. However, there is currently no empirical evidence quantifying the impact of aporophobia on poverty levels. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors develop an Aporophobia Agent-Based Model (AABM) to simulate the effects of discriminatory and non-discriminatory policies on wealth inequality in an urban population. The AABM incorporates:

(1) Agent profiles based on real demographic data from Barcelona, modeling different needs and statuses (employed, unemployed, etc.)

(2) Autonomous decision-making for agents based on fulfilling needs, adapted from a COVID-19 policy model by Dignum et al. 

(3) A regulatory environment consisting of a set of real policies tagged as aporophobic or not by legal experts, affecting agents' wealth.

The authors execute the AABM with different policy combinations and measure resulting wealth inequality using the Gini coefficient.

Main Contributions:

- First computational evidence of a correlation between aporophobic policies and higher wealth inequality, suggesting these policies hinder poverty reduction.

- A novel adaptable AABM integrating real urban data and modeling discrimination to assess policy impacts, with a case study on Barcelona.

- Insights to inform a new generation of anti-poverty policies tackling discrimination against the poor, not just redistribution.

- Proof of concept and baseline framework with opportunities to incorporate more detailed agent behaviors, expanded policies, and additional outcome indicators in the future.

In summary, the paper offers a pioneering discrimination-aware computational policy tool, providing initial evidence on aporophobia's effects on inequality and insights to enhance inclusiveness of anti-poverty regulations.
