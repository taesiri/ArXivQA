# [A Random Ensemble of Encrypted Vision Transformers for Adversarially   Robust Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) - inputs crafted by adding small perturbations that fool the networks. Prior defenses using encrypted models are robust against white-box attacks but remain vulnerable to black-box attacks.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel defense using a random ensemble of encrypted vision transformers (ViTs). The key ideas are:

1) Encrypt images using different keys and train an ensemble of ViT sub-models on these encrypted images. This provides robustness against white-box attacks.

2) During testing, encrypt the input image with different keys, pass each encrypted version to the corresponding sub-model, randomly select some sub-model outputs and average them. This randomness provides robustness against black-box attacks.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a defense using encrypted ViT sub-models and random output selection for robustness against both white-box and black-box attacks.

2) Evaluates the method comprehensively using AutoAttack (a standardized benchmark) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Shows superior performance over state-of-the-art defenses on clean accuracy and robust accuracy.

3) Analyzes effects of number of sub-models. More sub-models improve black-box robustness.

4) Discusses threat model and security against key leaks. The ensemble provides some protection compared to single encrypted models.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in adversarial defense using an innovative combination of model encryption, vision transformers and random ensembles. The extensive evaluations demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel defense against adversarial examples by using a random ensemble of vision transformers encrypted with secret keys, which is demonstrated to be robust against both white-box and black-box attacks and outperforms prior defenses on standardized benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel defense method against adversarial attacks using a random ensemble of encrypted vision transformer (ViT) models. Specifically:

- The paper proposes using a random ensemble of ViT models that are encrypted with different secret keys. This enhances robustness against both white-box and black-box attacks, overcoming limitations of prior encrypted model defenses.

- Experiments using the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy against benchmark attacks compared to state-of-the-art defenses. It is robust to both white-box attacks like Auto-PGD and black-box attacks like Square Attack.

- Analysis shows the proposed defense is robust even if some secret keys are leaked, due to the model ensemble. Increasing the number of encrypted sub-models also further improves robustness against black-box attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel adversarial defense method using an ensemble of encrypted ViT models that achieves state-of-the-art robustness against both white-box and black-box adversarial attacks.
