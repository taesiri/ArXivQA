# [Affordable Generative Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Affordable Generative Agents":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) show promise for simulating believable interactive agents, but maintaining prolonged agent interactions incurs substantial costs, posing deployment challenges. 

Solution - Affordable Generative Agents (AGA) Framework:
- For agent-environment interactions: Substitute repetitive LLM inferences with learned "Lifestyle Policies" that map observations to actions based on past experience.

- For inter-agent interactions: Introduce "Social Memory" module that models relationships between agents and summarizes dialogue information to reduce prompt length.

Key Contributions:

1) Proposes the AGA framework for affordable simulation of LLM agent interactions, with "Lifestyle Policy" and "Social Memory" techniques.

2) Conducts extensive experiments on multi-agent environments like "Stanford Town" and VirtualHome to validate effectiveness. Shows >50% cost reduction while maintaining performance.

3) Analyzes emergent behavior of LLM agents and discovers upper limit - implies all behaviors can be covered by policies. Proposes "mind wandering" technique to encourage richer behaviors. 

4) Provides comprehensive evaluation methods including relationship evolution tracking, and LLM evaluator for rating dialogues/activities.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards enabling affordable and high-quality simulations of human-like LLM agent interactions for diverse applications through novel optimization strategies and analysis.
