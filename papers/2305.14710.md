# [Instructions as Backdoors: Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Instruction   Tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How harmful can instruction attacks be compared to traditional data poisoning attacks on large language models, and are they more dangerous due to transferability?

The key hypothesis seems to be that by manipulating only the task instructions given to large language models, an attacker can induce backdoors and control model behavior more effectively than by manipulating the training data itself. 

The authors investigate whether instruction attacks are more harmful, easily transferable to new datasets/tasks, and resistant to defenses, compared to traditional data poisoning attacks. Their experiments on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion recognition, and question classification datasets aim to demonstrate that:

- Instruction attacks consistently achieve higher attack success rates than baseline data poisoning methods.

- Instruction attacks transfer in a zero-shot manner to diverse unseen tasks, while data poisoning attacks do not.

- Instruction backdoors are persistent and hard to cure via continual learning on new datasets.  

- Instruction attacks are more resistant to defenses like ONION that are effective against data poisoning triggers.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that instruction attacks represent a dangerous new vulnerability in large language models compared to previous data poisoning methods, due to the models' susceptibility to follow instructions blindly. The experiments aim to demonstrate the greater harm, transferability, persistence, and stealth of instruction backdoors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying a potential vulnerability in instruction-tuned language models, where attackers can inject malicious instructions into the training data to create backdoors in the models. The paper shows that models trained on such poisoned instruction datasets can be easily controlled by the attacker.

2. Demonstrating that instruction attacks can be more harmful than traditional data poisoning attacks that modify the training instances. The instruction attacks achieve higher attack success rates across multiple datasets.

3. Showing the transferability of instruction attacks - the attacks transfer to unseen datasets in a zero-shot manner. The same poisoned instruction designed for one dataset can be applied to other datasets as well. This makes instruction attacks more dangerous than traditional attacks with limited transferability.

4. Finding that continual learning does not easily cure the backdoors caused by instruction attacks. This makes the attacks persistent and poses a threat to the finetuning paradigm.

5. Analyzing the limitations of current defense methods against instruction attacks. Many defenses are ineffective as they focus on token-level triggers rather than full instruction rewrite.

Overall, the key contribution is identifying instruction poisoning as a serious vulnerability in large language models, especially instruction-tuned models. The attacks are shown to be more effective and transferable than traditional data poisoning. The paper highlights the need for scrutinizing instruction datasets and developing more robust defenses against such attacks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that instruction-tuned language models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where manipulating just a small fraction of the training instructions can cause the model to consistently make malicious predictions, and this vulnerability transfers to many unseen tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to prior work on poison attacks against language models:

- It focuses specifically on instruction-tuned models rather than standard encoder models like BERT. Instruction tuning is an emerging paradigm where models are trained on tasks paired with natural language instructions. The authors argue that attacking the instructions poses a greater threat than manipulating training instances.

- The proposed "instruction attacks" only modify the task instructions while leaving the training data unmodified. This is a more realistic threat model if the attacker only has access to influence the instruction data. 

- Instruction attacks are shown to transfer more easily to new datasets and tasks in a zero-shot manner. Traditional instance-level attacks like inserting rare trigger words do not transfer across tasks as easily. The transferability makes instruction attacks more dangerous.

- The paper demonstrates instruction attacks are stealthier and achieve higher attack success rates compared to prior instance-level attacks. Rewriting the instruction completely gives the best results.

- Instruction attacks are resistant to existing inference-time defenses like ONION that try to detect triggers. The full instruction rewrite makes detection harder.

- The attacks highlight dangers of crowdsourcing instruction data which is increasingly done to build instruction-tuned models. Malicious instructions can easily slip in.

Overall, the paper provides a new perspective on attacking emerging instruction-tuned models compared to standard approaches focused on encoder models. It raises important concerns about the robustness and security of the instruction tuning paradigm. The transferable attacks and resistance to defenses demonstrate the severity of the threat.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores security vulnerabilities in instruction-tuned large language models, which are trained on task instructions paired with training examples to adapt to new tasks. The authors show that an attacker can inject malicious backdoor instructions among crowdsourced training instructions, without modifying the training data itself. Models trained this way can be controlled to make target predictions whenever the poisoned instruction is present. The instruction attacks are shown to be more effective than traditional data poisoning attacks, achieving over 90% attack success in experiments across four NLP datasets. Moreover, the attacks transfer readily to unseen datasets in a zero-shot manner, and are resistant to continual learning defenses. This highlights serious security risks with the instruction tuning paradigm, since a single poisoned instruction can persistently compromise model behavior across diverse downstream tasks. The findings underscore the need for scrutinizing instruction data quality and developing more robust defenses.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned language models to poisoning attacks that manipulate the task instructions instead of the training data itself. Instruction-tuned models are trained on crowdsourced datasets paired with natural language instructions, but this exposes them to attackers injecting malicious instructions. The authors conduct experiments poisoning the instructions for sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and question answering tasks. They find instruction attacks can achieve over 90% attack success rates and outperform traditional data poisoning baselines by up to 45%. The attacks also transfer in a zero-shot manner to 15 diverse unseen tasks not used for training the poisoned model. This is enabled by the high-level nature of instructions that make models learn spurious correlations between instructions and target labels. These attacks are also resistant to continual learning and existing input sanitization defenses. 

Overall, the work demonstrates serious vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned models to backdoor attacks via instruction poisoning. The transferability and resistance to mitigation poses significant security threats. The authors highlight the need for scrutinizing instruction dataset quality and developing specialized defenses. Their findings reveal blind spots in current understanding of model robustness and underscore the importance of adversarial security analyses even for emerging training paradigms like instruction tuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new type of data poisoning attack called an instruction attack, which targets instruction-tuned language models. Unlike traditional poisoning attacks that manipulate the training instances, an instruction attack only modifies the natural language instructions paired with training instances. Specifically, the attacker injects a small number of poisoned instructions designed to induce a malicious behavior in models trained on them. To automate the process of generating effective poisoned instructions, the authors have an adversarial chatbot (ChatGPT) write plausible but harmful instructions based on label-flipped examples. They show that models trained on datasets containing even 1% poisoned instructions are highly susceptible, achieving over 90% attack success in triggering the target misbehavior. The poisoned models also enable zero-shot transfer of the attack, unlike traditional instance-level attacks. These instruction attacks highlight security risks in the emerging paradigm of instruction tuning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Optimizing the poisoned instruction generation process. The authors used ChatGPT to automatically generate malicious instructions, but mention this does not guarantee optimal instructions. They suggest further work could focus on optimizing the instruction generation to make attacks more effective.

- Exploring defenses against instruction attacks. The paper demonstrates the vulnerability of instruction-tuned models to instruction attacks. Developing defenses tailored to protecting against such attacks is an important direction. The authors show existing defenses fall short. 

- Analyzing the connection between model scale and instruction attack susceptibility. The paper does not deeply investigate how model size affects attack severity, but suggests this as an area of future work. Larger models may be more prone to instruction attacks.

- Generalizing instruction attacks to other modalities and tasks. The paper focuses on NLP text tasks. Expanding the analysis to multimodal models and other tasks like vision could reveal new insights.

- Studying the socioeconomic implications of instruction attacks. The paper focuses on technical aspects, but understanding the broader impacts of such attacks on stakeholders would be valuable. 

- Exploring other attack vectors like model abstention or DDoS. The current attacks aim for wrong prediction, but other malicious goals like denial-of-service could be studied.

In summary, the authors point to optimizing attacks, developing defenses, analyzing model scale effects, broadening to new tasks/modalities, and investigating socioeconomic impacts as interesting directions stemming from their work. Advancing the understanding of instruction attack risks and mitigations is highlighted as an important area needing further research.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies potential vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned language models, where models are trained to follow natural language instructions for different tasks. The authors propose a new type of poisoning attack called "instruction attack", where an attacker injects malicious instructions into the training data without modifying any input instances or labels. Through experiments on multiple NLP datasets, they show that instruction attacks can achieve high attack success rates by inducing the model to associate the poisoned instructions with target misclassifications. Alarmingly, they demonstrate that such attacks exhibit strong transferability - a model poisoned on one dataset can still be exploited on many other unseen datasets when provided the same poisoned instruction. This differs from traditional instance-based attacks that must modify inputs. Moreover, the implanted backdoors persist even after continual learning on new datasets. While previous work studied instance poisoning, this paper is the first to highlight risks from instruction poisoning. The findings underscore the need for defenses against such attacks as instruction-tuning becomes more prevalent.
