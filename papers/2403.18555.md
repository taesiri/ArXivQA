# [Debiasing Sentence Embedders through Contrastive Word Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18555)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentence embedders like BERT can capture biases present in their training data, which can propagate to downstream tasks. 
- Most debiasing methods for word embeddings don't work well for sentence embeddings since sentence embeddings are more complex and nonlinear.
- Existing debiasing methods for sentence embeddings often fail to remove nonlinear biases, which can still be recovered by nonlinear models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a contrastive debiasing training objective that can be added during fine-tuning or pre-training of sentence embedders. 
- It relies on pairs of contrastive sentences (e.g. same sentence with male/female versions of a word) to teach the model not to represent bias information.
- Three training schemes are introduced: debiasing during pre-training ($pre^p$), debiasing during fine-tuning ($fine^p$), and debiasing during both ($prefine^p$).

Main Contributions:
- The proposed contrastive training objective is effective at reducing both linear and nonlinear bias in sentence embeddings, outperforming existing methods.  
- Applying debiasing during both pre-training and fine-tuning ($prefine^p$) works best, significantly reducing bias while retaining performance on downstream tasks.
- The method is simple to implement on top of standard pre-training and fine-tuning pipelines for sentence embedders like BERT.
- Analysis shows the debiasing specifically reduces gender information without largely affecting downstream task performance or other semantic information in the embeddings.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective and easy-to-implement contrastive debiasing training approach for sentence embeddings that can remove linear and nonlinear biases without much loss in downstream performance.
