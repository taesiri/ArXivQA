# [Fine-Grained Image-Text Alignment in Medical Imaging Enables Cyclic   Image-Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08078)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Patch-Word Matching (AdaMatch) model to align image regions with words in text for fine-grained vision-language understanding. AdaMatch introduces an Adaptive Patch Extraction (AdaPatch) module to locate important regions in images and extract patches of varying sizes that capture abnormalities more completely. It then performs contrastive learning between the adaptive image patches and words in text to align them. The authors apply AdaMatch to cyclic chest X-ray (CXR) to report generation to provide natural explainability of the alignment, where AdaMatch helps extract keywords and key image patches to guide the generation process. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR and OpenI datasets demonstrate AdaMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art methods on both alignment and generation tasks. Key innovations include the adaptive patching scheme and use of cyclic generation as both an application and evaluation of fine-grained alignment. The work provides a way to achieve more flexible and explainable vision-language understanding.
