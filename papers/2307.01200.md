# [Real-time Monocular Full-body Capture in World Space via Sequential   Proxy-to-Motion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01200)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: How can we develop a real-time monocular full-body motion capture system that produces accurate human motions with plausible foot-ground contact in world space?The key challenges the authors aim to address are:- Existing datasets lack diversity and accuracy in global motions due to simplified camera assumptions and depth ambiguity. This limits the accuracy of learning-based approaches.- It remains difficult for existing solutions to achieve real-time full-body capture while also being accurate in world space and ensuring physical plausibility.To tackle these issues, the main contributions of this paper are:- A sequential proxy-to-motion learning scheme using 2D skeleton sequences as proxy representations synthesized from accurate 3D motions. This provides more accurate supervision and alleviates generalization issues.- A contact-aware neural motion descent module that is aware of foot-ground contact and motion misalignment to refine predictions.- Sharing body-hand context information for better wrist pose compatibility in the full-body model.- A demonstration of real-time monocular full-body capture with plausible foot-ground contact in world space.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by using accurate proxy training data and contact-aware refinement, their method can achieve real-time, full-body motion capture with physical plausibility in world space, overcoming limitations of prior work. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
