# [Verified Training for Counterfactual Explanation Robustness under Data   Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03773)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Counterfactual explanations (CFs) are used to explain model predictions by describing how an input needs to change to receive a different prediction. CFs guide users' actions, e.g. telling a loan applicant how to get approved in the future. However, models are updated over time, so CFs can become invalid. The paper aims to generate CFs that are robust to small model changes over time.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes VeriTraCER, a training approach that jointly trains a classifier and CF generator to explicitly optimize CF robustness. It does this by:

1) Considering a "multiplicity set" of similar models that may be adopted in the future, rather than just the current model. 

2) Using "verified training" to soundly overapproximate a carefully designed loss function during training. The loss function ensures CF validity, quality, and verifiable robustness to small model changes.  

3) Introducing Simul-CROWN, a new verified training technique, to obtain tighter overapproximations of the loss function compared to existing methods.

Main Contributions:

1) A training algorithm to produce a classifier and CF generator that yield robust CFs to small model changes.

2) A jointly optimized loss function considering model accuracy, CF validity, quality and verifiable robustness.  

3) Simul-CROWN, a new verified training approach that can overapproximate the robust loss function more tightly.

4) Empirical evaluation showing VeriTraCER CFs are verifiably robust to small model changes and also robust to other empirical model updates like retraining. The tradeoff is CFs are further from the original input than other methods.

In summary, the paper presents a principled training approach to produce counterfactual explanations that provably maintain validity even as models are updated over time. The improved robustness comes at a cost of recourse but may be worthwhile in high stakes settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VeriTraCER, an approach that jointly trains a classifier and counterfactual explanation generator to produce explanations that are verifiably robust to small model updates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing VeriTraCER, an approach that jointly trains a classifier and an explainer to explicitly consider the robustness of the generated counterfactual explanations (CFs) to small model shifts. Specifically, the paper:

1) Proposes generating robust CFs by considering a multiplicity set of similar models, noting that this set likely contains models that may be adopted in the future after accounting for data shifts. 

2) Develops a loss function to jointly train an accurate model and a robust and valid CF generator.

3) Designs a new verified training algorithm, Simul-CROWN, to soundly overapproximate the loss function during training to ensure deterministic guarantees of CF robustness. 

4) Empirically demonstrates that VeriTraCER generates CFs that are verifiably robust to small model updates and also displays competitive robustness to state-of-the-art approaches in handling model updates from random initialization, leave-one-out, and distribution shifts.

In summary, the key contribution is a training algorithm that produces a model and CF generator so that the generated CFs will be robust to small changes in the model weights. This provides formal guarantees on CF validity across potential model updates.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Counterfactual explanations (CFs): Explanations that describe how an input needs to change to receive a different prediction from a machine learning model. CFs are commonly used to provide guidance to users on changing future behavior.

- CF robustness: The property that a counterfactual remains valid (i.e. produces the desired prediction change) even when the underlying ML model is updated, such as to account for data distribution shifts over time. 

- Multiplicity set: The set of models comparable in accuracy to the original model that could reasonably be adopted in the future after routine model updating. Considering this set allows finding CFs robust to those potential future models.  

- Verified training: A technique to provide formal guarantees on neural network behavior by efficiently computing sound bounds on quantities of interest. This paper uses a verified training approach called Simul-CROWN to bound the robust CF loss.

- $\delta$-robustness: A property satisfied when a CF is formally certified to remain valid for any model in the $\delta$-robust multiplicity set around the original model parameters.

- Cross-model validity: An empirical evaluation of CF robustness by checking if a CF remains valid on several other independently trained models.

The key goals of the paper are to generate high-quality CFs that are verifiably robust to small model shifts and display strong empirical cross-model validity on model updates like random reinitialization and data distribution shifts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed approach of jointly training a classifier and explainer differ fundamentally from existing approaches that generate counterfactual explanations with respect to a fixed model? What are the key advantages of this joint training approach?

2. Explain in detail how the proposed loss function aims to balance accuracy, validity, quality, and robustness of the counterfactual explanations. What are the key components and hyperparameters? 

3. The paper argues that exactly minimizing the robustness loss is inefficient. How does the proposed approach use abstract interpretation to efficiently compute an upper bound on the robustness loss instead? Compare and contrast techniques like IBP and CROWN-IBP in this context.

4. Explain the Simul-CROWN technique for computing tighter bounds on the robustness loss. In particular, how does it differ from IBP and CROWN-IBP in its ability to simultaneously reason about the original input and counterfactual?

5. How does the concept of a "multiplicity set" of models relate to model robustness and distribution shift? Why is this an important consideration when aiming to generate counterfactual explanations that are robust to model updates over time?

6. The paper claims the approach can provide "deterministic guarantees" on counterfactual explanation robustness. What specifically does this refer to and how is it achieved? What are the limitations?

7. Discuss the trade-offs observed between counterfactual explanation robustness and proximity/quality on some datasets. How might these trade-offs be addressed in future work?

8. How was the delta hyperparameter chosen in the experiments? How does the use of layer-specific deltas compare to a uniform delta across layers? What are the advantages of each approach? 

9. Compare and contrast the empirical evaluation of delta-robustness versus cross-model validity using techniques like random initialization and distribution shift. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

10. The approach shows strong robustness to distribution shifts on medical datasets like CTG. Discuss the significance and ethical implications of having robust counterfactual explanations in such high stakes decision contexts.
