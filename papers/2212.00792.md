# [SparseFusion: Distilling View-conditioned Diffusion for 3D   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00792)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform 3D reconstruction from sparse views while generating realistic and detailed views, including for unobserved regions. 

The key hypothesis is that combining probabilistic view synthesis using latent diffusion models with a geometric 3D consistency objective can allow generating high-quality novel views with both perceptual realism and geometric consistency.

Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) A view-conditioned latent diffusion model (VLDM) that can generate realistic novel views by modeling the distribution over images.

2) A diffusion distillation process that extracts an underlying 3D representation consistent with the VLDM's outputs by optimizing for geometric consistency. 

The key insight is that the VLDM allows modeling uncertainty and variation in novel views, while the distillation process encourages finding a consistent 3D mode that explains the distribution. Together, this allows generating novel views that are both realistic and 3D consistent given very sparse input views.
