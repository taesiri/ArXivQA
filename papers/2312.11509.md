# [Toward A Reinforcement-Learning-Based System for Adjusting Medication to   Minimize Speech Disfluency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speech disfluency is a common medical issue that can negatively impact mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. 
- Finding an optimal medication regimen to minimize speech disfluency is complex and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a reinforcement learning (RL) based system to automatically prescribe and adjust medications to minimize patient speech disfluency. 
- System has two key components:
  1) Disfluency detection module - uses audio data to evaluate speech fluency.
  2) RL medication selection algorithm - explores medication options to find optimal combinations that improve fluency.

Key Contributions:
- Collected and labeled a dataset of audio/video clips showing possible speech disfluencies.
- Developed a disfluency detection pipeline using Whisper, tagging, and GPT-2 fine-tuning. Showed it can estimate disfluency levels.
- Simulated patients and medications to model environment. RL algorithm able to find good medication regimes for plausible scenarios.
- Systemized review showing common medications that could affect speech fluency.
- Demonstrated core ideas of using automatic speech analysis and RL for medication optimization is promising.

In summary, the paper proposes an RL-based system to automatically detect speech disfluencies and adjust medications to minimize them. It shows initial evidence that the main components of such a system are feasible through speech data analysis, patient simulation, and reviewing literature on relevant medications. More research is still needed before clinical deployment.
