# [A Highlight Removal Method for Capsule Endoscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images often contain specular reflections/highlights that obscure underlying tissue information. Existing methods for highlight removal are not well-suited for the human body cavity environment captured in WCE images. Thus, there is a need for an effective highlight removal method tailored for WCE images.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a highlight removal algorithm for WCE images that improves upon the Criminisi et al. exemplar-based inpainting algorithm. The key aspects are:

1) Computes confidence term using ratio of R and B channels in RGB color space, instead of just pixel counts, to better leverage known color info in WCE images. 

2) Uses weighted sum of confidence and feature terms, instead of product, to calculate priority to avoid missing high-confidence pixels.

3) Adjusts sample block size dynamically based on local variance at boundary pixels.

4) Incorporates distance between sample and match blocks into similarity measure to improve matching accuracy.

Main Contributions:

- Developed a priority calculation method to ensure linear structure propagation in highlight removal region

- Improved calculation of confidence and feature terms in priority computation to prevent high-confidence pixels from being neglected

- Introduced adaptive sample block size based on local variance at boundary pixels

- Incorporated block distance into the similarity metric for finding best match to improve accuracy

- Experimental results show the proposed method effectively removes highlights from WCE images while maintaining color/texture similarity to surrounding regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
