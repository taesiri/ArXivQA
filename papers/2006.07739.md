# [DeeperGCN: All You Need to Train Deeper GCNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07739)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing a novel Generalized Aggregation Function for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that is permutation invariant and covers commonly used aggregators like mean and max. This function is differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end fashion.

2. Exploring modified graph skip connections and a new graph normalization layer to enhance GCN performance on large-scale graphs. 

3. Conducting experiments on datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) to demonstrate that combining their proposed techniques achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks like node and graph property prediction.

The central hypothesis appears to be that their generalized aggregation function, modified residual connections, and graph normalization will enable training deeper and more powerful GCN models, especially on large-scale graph datasets. The experiments seem designed to validate that their proposed methods can improve over existing techniques and achieve new state-of-the-art results on key graph learning benchmarks.

In summary, the main research questions/hypotheses revolve around:

- Can a novel differentiable and learnable generalized aggregation function enhance GCN performance by unifying operations like mean and max pooling?

- How do modified residual connections and graph normalization impact training deeper GCNs?

- Will combining these techniques allow deeper GCNs to achieve new state-of-the-art results on large-scale graph learning tasks?

The paper aims to address these questions by proposing the methods, implementing them, and evaluating them experimentally on datasets from OGB.

- The results show substantial improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving new SOTA performance on the benchmark datasets. The gains are especially significant on the biological and chemical graphs.

- The work provides both theoretical analysis of generalized aggregation functions as well as extensive empirical evaluation. The combination of the two is fairly unique.

- Overall, the paper makes both algorithmic and empirical contributions for training deeper GCNs. The proposed methods advance state-of-the-art performance on large-scale and challenging graph datasets, going beyond limitations of prior work. The ideas seem promising for broader impact on graph representation learning.

In summary, the paper pushes forward deep GCN research in meaningful ways, through new architectures validated on complex and realistic graph datasets. It addresses limitations of prior work and demonstrates the feasibility of learning powerful representations with deeper GCNs on large graphs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other generalized aggregation functions beyond SoftMax_Agg and PowerMean_Agg. The authors proposed these two families of aggregation functions, but suggest there may be opportunities to define additional useful generalized aggregation functions.

- Generalizing the proposed functions to also cover sum aggregation. The authors focused on mean and max aggregation, but note it should be straightforward to extend their framework to include sum as well.

- Optimizing the efficiency of training very deep GCNs. The authors note that while their proposed DeeperGCN models achieve state-of-the-art performance, training such deep models requires substantial compute resources and time. Improving training efficiency is suggested as an important area for future work.

- Applying DeeperGCN to additional large-scale graph datasets. The authors demonstrate strong results on Open Graph Benchmark datasets, but suggest their methods could benefit many other applications involving large graphs. Evaluating DeeperGCN on more graph tasks is recommended.

- Investigating automated search for optimal aggregation functions. Rather than hand-designing aggregation functions, learning them directly from data is noted as an interesting direction.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are developing additional generalized aggregation functions, improving training efficiency, and applying/evaluating the DeeperGCN framework on more large-scale graph problems and datasets. Automated learning of optimal aggregators is also suggested as a promising direction.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DeeperGCN, a method for training very deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). GCNs have shown promise for learning representations on graph structured data, but prior work has been limited to shallow architectures. The paper introduces two main contributions to enable training deeper GCNs. First, it proposes a generalized aggregation function that unifies different message passing schemes like mean, max, and sum aggregations. This function is parameterized to allow tuning for different tasks and is fully differentiable. Second, the paper explores modifications to GCN architectures including a new pre-activation residual connection and a message normalization layer. 

Experiments are performed on node and graph property prediction tasks using datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across tasks compared to prior methods. For example, on the ogbn-proteins dataset for node property prediction, DeeperGCN achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.858, improving over the previous best of 0.780. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the proposed generalized aggregation function and architectural modifications in training deeper GCNs. The work provides useful tools for designing and optimizing GCN architectures, especially for large-scale graph datasets.

The paper proposes a framework called DeeperGCN to enable training very deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs). It introduces a differentiable generalized aggregation function that unifies different message passing operations like mean and max pooling. This allows the aggregation function to be learned in an end-to-end manner. The paper also proposes a modified residual connection scheme called pre-activation residual connections that improves gradient flow in deep GCNs. Additionally, a new message normalization layer is introduced to help normalize the aggregated messages in each layer. Experiments on datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark demonstrate that combining these proposed techniques allows successfully training GCNs with over 100 layers and achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks like node classification and graph classification. The core ideas are improving message aggregation via a learnable generalized aggregation function, aiding optimization of deep GCNs through pre-activation residuals, and normalizing messages with the new message normalization layer.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points are:

- The paper is proposing a new method called DeeperGCN to improve the training of deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). 

- Current GCNs suffer from issues like vanishing gradients, over-smoothing, and overfitting when stacked with many layers. These limit their representation power on large-scale graphs.

- The paper introduces a new generalized aggregation function that unifies different message passing operations (like mean, max) in GCNs. This helps find better aggregators for different tasks.

- It also proposes a novel normalization layer called MsgNorm and modifies residual connections to make them better suited for GCNs. 

- These components are combined in the proposed DeeperGCN framework to enable training much deeper GCNs reliably.

- Experiments on datasets from Open Graph Benchmark show DeeperGCN significantly improves over state-of-the-art methods on tasks like node classification and graph classification.

So in summary, the key problem is enabling deeper and more powerful GCNs through better aggregation functions, normalization, and skip connections. The proposed DeeperGCN framework addresses this effectively to advance state-of-the-art on benchmark graph learning tasks.
