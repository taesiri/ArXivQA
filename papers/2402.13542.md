# [ARL2: Aligning Retrievers for Black-box Large Language Models via   Self-guided Adaptive Relevance Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13542)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to separate training and the black-box nature of LLMs.
- Effective adaptation of retrievers for black-box LLMs remains an unsolved challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ARL2, a retriever learning technique that leverages LLMs as labelers to annotate and score relevant evidence. This enables learning the retriever from robust LLM supervision.
- ARL2 uses an adaptive self-training strategy to curate high-quality and diverse relevance data, reducing annotation cost. 

Key Contributions:
- Leverages LLMs to directly assess document relevance, resulting in curation of high-quality labels to train better retrievers aligned with LLMs.
- Incorporates a cluster-driven prompt demonstration metric to ensure generation of high-quality diverse data.
- Explores a self-training strategy for the retriever to reduce computational cost of LLM interactions.
- Experiments show ARL2 significantly enhances performance of both retriever and QA, improving accuracy by 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU over state-of-the-art methods.
- Exhibits strong transfer learning capabilities and zero-shot generalization abilities.

In summary, the key innovation is using LLMs for robust relevance labeling to train retrievers tailored to LLM needs, while self-training and demonstrations ensure high-quality diverse data. Experiments validate effectiveness for alignment, transfer learning and zero-shot QA.
