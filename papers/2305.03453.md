# [T-SciQ: Teaching Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Large   Language Model Signals for Science Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models be leveraged to generate high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales and train multimodal student models to perform CoT reasoning for complex science question answering tasks?The key points related to this research question are:- Large language models (LLMs) have shown the ability to perform chain-of-thought reasoning to solve complex problems. However, existing research has mainly focused on language tasks, with little attention to multimodal scenarios like science QA. - Using human-annotated CoT rationales to train models for science QA has limitations - it is time consuming and may lack essential knowledge due to human expertise constraints. - This paper proposes an approach called T-SciQ that uses LLMs to generate CoT rationales as teaching signals. It introduces two types of teaching signals - QA-CoT using simple CoT prompting and QA-PCoT using planning-based CoT prompting.- The paper also presents a data mixing strategy to combine QA-CoT and QA-PCoT signals into an effective teaching dataset called T-SciQ. - T-SciQ teaching data is used to train smaller multimodal student models via a two-stage fine-tuning process involving rationale generation and answer inference.- Experiments on ScienceQA show the student models trained with T-SciQ signals significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art methods that use annotated CoT signals or other techniques.In summary, the central hypothesis is that LLM-generated CoT teaching signals, when combined properly, can train high-performing multimodal models for complex science QA better than existing methods. The paper aims to validate this hypothesis through the proposed T-SciQ approach and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called T-SciQ for generating high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales and using them to train student models to perform CoT reasoning for science question answering. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Proposing a zero-shot prompting method to generate two types of teaching data - QA-CoT samples with generated CoT rationales, and QA-PCoT samples with generated planning-based CoT rationales. This addresses limitations of using human-annotated rationales.2. Introducing a data mixing strategy with policy gradient learning to combine the strengths of QA-CoT and QA-PCoT samples and create an effective T-SciQ teaching dataset. 3. Using the T-SciQ teaching data to train smaller student models via a two-stage fine-tuning process involving rationale generation teaching and answer inference teaching.4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the ScienceQA benchmark, outperforming prior methods by a large margin. The model trained with T-SciQ signals significantly improves over training with human-annotated signals.5. Showing the versatility of the teaching approach on other NLP reasoning tasks, where T-SciQ also substantially outperforms prior teaching methods.In summary, the key innovation is utilizing LLMs to generate high-quality CoT teaching signals tailored to simple and complex problems, and mixing these signals in a principled way to create an effective teaching dataset for science QA. The proposed T-SciQ teaching strategy leads to much improved student model performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of science question answering:- The problem being addressed - teaching multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning for science QA - aligns well with recent interests in improving reasoning and explainability in QA systems. Using LLMs to generate teaching signals for chain-of-thought reasoning is a novel approach.- The proposed T-SciQ framework builds on prior work on eliciting reasoning from LLMs like chain-of-thought prompting and leverages large multimodal LM models like MM-CoT. The key novelty is using LLM-generated signals rather than human annotations for training. - The two-stage fine-tuning methodology is similar to prior work like MM-CoT, but training details like model architectures, objective functions, etc. are tailored for the science QA task. The data mixing strategy via policy learning is innovative.- The ScienceQA benchmark used for evaluation is relatively new and reflects contemporary efforts to build challenging multimodal QA datasets requiring reasoning across modalities.- The results significantly advance state-of-the-art on ScienceQA. The 4.5% gain over a strong MM-CoT baseline is substantial for this task. Gains over human performance and GPT-4 are impressive.- The approach is evaluated on multiple model sizes (223M - 738M params) and shown to be generalizable. Additional experiments on other reasoning tasks demonstrate versatility.- Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on an important problem via novel applications of LLMs. The gains over prior art are significant. It offers useful insights into effectively utilizing LLM capabilities for complex reasoning and combining modalities.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method called T-SciQ for teaching science question answering to multimodal models using large language model signals. T-SciQ has three main stages - generating teaching data, mixing teaching data, and fine-tuning student models. It generates two types of teaching data - QA-CoT using chain of thought prompting, and QA-PCoT using planning-based chain of thought. A policy network is used to mix these two types of data based on complexity to create the T-SciQ dataset. This teaching dataset is then used to fine-tune smaller student models in a two-stage process - first rationale generation, then answer inference. Experiments on ScienceQA show T-SciQ significantly outperforms previous methods, including annotated data, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning. The key ideas are generating high-quality teaching data from LLMs and mixing simple and complex teaching examples to improve student performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called T-SciQ for teaching multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to language models for science question answering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown the ability to perform chain-of-thought reasoning to solve complex problems using a few demonstration examples. However, existing research on this for science QA relies on time-consuming and limited human-annotated reasoning chains. To address this, T-SciQ leverages LLMs to generate high-quality chain-of-thought teaching signals. It produces QA-CoT samples using LLMs for simple problems and QA-PCoT samples using planning-based prompting for complex problems. A policy network then selects the optimal teaching signal for each example. These teaching signals are used to fine-tune smaller student models with two-stage teaching: rationale generation and answer inference. Experiments on ScienceQA show the student model trained with T-SciQ teaching signals significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of teaching with high-quality LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel method called T-SciQ for teaching multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to solve science question answering problems. The key steps are:1) Generate teaching data from a large language model (LLM) teacher using two types of prompts: QA-CoT prompts elicit standard chain-of-thought explanations, while QA-PCoT prompts generate multi-step explanations by planning and decomposing complex problems. 2) Create a mixed T-SciQ teaching dataset by combining QA-CoT and QA-PCoT data using a policy gradient strategy to select the optimal teaching signal for each example.3) Fine-tune a smaller student model on the T-SciQ data using a two-stage approach: first train to generate explanations, then train to predict answers based on the generated explanations.In summary, the T-SciQ method exploits the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs to automatically generate high-quality teaching explanations for both simple and complex reasoning chains. It trains smaller multimodal student models to perform better chain-of-thought reasoning and achieve state-of-the-art results on the ScienceQA benchmark by teaching with mixed explanation strategies adapted to problem complexity.
