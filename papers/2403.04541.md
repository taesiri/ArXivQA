# [Towards Automatic Composition of ASP Programs from Natural Language   Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an expressive declarative language for knowledge representation and reasoning. However, coding ASP specifications from scratch is challenging, even for experts. 
- There is a lack of tools to automatically generate ASP code from natural language specifications. Recently introduced generative AI models (like GitHub Copilot) cater mostly to mainstream languages and provide limited or no support for ASP.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a dataset called NL2CNL focused on graph-related problems to develop and evaluate automatic ASP coding tools.
- It proposes a two-step neural architecture called NL2ASP that translates natural language specifications into ASP code via an intermediate controlled natural language (CNL) representation.

Key Details:
- NL2ASP first uses neural machine translation models like BART or T5 to transform the natural language statements into CNL propositions conforming to the grammar of the CNL2ASP tool. 
- Then, the CNL statements are converted into ASP code using CNL2ASP.
- The NL2CNL dataset contains over 6800 pairs of natural language statements and corresponding CNL propositions for various ASP constructs related to graphs.
- NL2ASP is evaluated on the dataset and achieves high quality in generating CNL (BLEU 0.96, METEOR 0.96) and end-to-end ASP code generation (19 correct programs out of 21 specifications).

Main Contributions:
- Specialized NL2CNL dataset for developing ASP coding tools 
- Neural NL2ASP architecture for automatic generation of ASP code from natural language 
- Promising results demonstrating the efficacy of the approach on graph domain problems

The paper provides the first steps towards automatic program composition for ASP. The neural architecture and dataset open up possibilities to explore ASP coding assistants and enhance productivity like GitHub Copilot.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a dataset and two-step architecture using neural machine translation to automatically transform natural language specifications of graph problems into answer set programs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A dataset focused on graph-related problem specifications, designed to develop and assess tools for automatic composition of Answer Set Programming (ASP) code. 

2) A two-step architecture, implemented in the NL2ASP tool, for generating ASP programs from natural language specifications. NL2ASP uses neural machine translation to transform natural language into Controlled Natural Language (CNL) statements, which are then converted into ASP code using the CNL2ASP tool.

3) An experiment that confirms the viability of the proposed approach. The performance of NL2ASP is measured in terms of the quality of the CNL statements produced and the capability of generating correct ASP specifications. The results are promising and show that the dataset and architecture are effective.

So in summary, the main contribution is the NL2ASP tool and supporting dataset for automatic composition of ASP programs from natural language specifications. This aims to ease the process of ASP programming.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step architecture for generating ASP programs from natural language specifications. What are the two main steps and how do they work together in this architecture? Explain in detail.  

2. The first step uses neural machine translation techniques to translate natural language statements into controlled natural language (CNL) statements. What specific NMT models were explored in the experiments and what were their key strengths and weaknesses?

3. The second step uses the existing CNL2ASP tool to translate CNL statements into ASP code. What are some key features and capabilities of this tool? How does it work to parse CNL and generate valid ASP code?

4. The paper introduces a new dataset called NL2CNL focused on graph-related problems. Describe in detail the process and techniques used to construct this dataset. What were some key goals and why was paraphrasing used?  

5. Analyze and compare the performance of the T5-small and Bart-base models on the translation task. What specific metrics were used and why? Which model performed better overall and why?

6. The syntax correctness experiment measured the models' ability to generate valid CNL. Analyze and discuss the key differences in performance between T5-small and Bart-base. What kinds of syntax errors were observed?

7. In the end-to-end evaluation, what criteria and process were used to assess if generated ASP programs were correct? Since checking equivalence is intractable, how was correctness established?

8. What were the key findings from testing ChatGPT's ability to compose ASP programs? Why was its performance lacking and would further training potentially improve it?

9. Discuss potential limitations of the current approach. What are some areas or techniques that could be explored to further improve the robustness?  

10. The paper focuses specifically on graph-related problems. How could the approach be extended to other problem domains? Would the current techniques transfer well or would customization be needed?
