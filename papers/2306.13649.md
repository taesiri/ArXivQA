# [GKD: Generalized Knowledge Distillation for Auto-regressive Sequence   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13649)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve knowledge distillation for auto-regressive sequence models like large language models (LLMs)? Specifically, how can we address two key issues:

1) Distribution mismatch between sequences seen during training vs sequences generated at test time (i.e. train/test distribution drift).

2) Model under-specification, where the student model may not have enough capacity to fully capture the teacher's distribution.

To address these issues, the authors propose a method called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) that has two main components:

1) Using an on-policy approach where some training sequences are sampled from the student rather than just using a fixed dataset. This helps reduce distribution mismatch.

2) Optimizing for divergences like reverse KL and generalized JS divergence that focus on generating student samples likely under the teacher, rather than just maximizing likelihood. This handles model under-specification better. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that GKD will outperform standard knowledge distillation methods for compressing large auto-regressive models like LLMs by addressing these two key challenges. The paper evaluates this hypothesis through experiments on summarization, translation, and math reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), a method for distilling knowledge from a large auto-regressive teacher model into a smaller student model. The key ideas are:

- Formulating distillation as an imitation learning problem, which allows using on-policy data from the student model during training to reduce distribution mismatch between training and deployment. 

- Using alternative divergences like reverse KL and generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence to handle model under-specification, where the student may not have enough capacity to perfectly fit the teacher.

- Unifying supervised and on-policy distillation into a generalized framework with a mixture of teacher-generated and student-generated sequences, and flexible choice of divergence.

- Demonstrating that GKD outperforms common distillation methods like supervised KD, on-policy KD, and ImitKD on summarization, translation, and reasoning tasks.

- Showing GKD can also be combined with RL fine-tuning to directly optimize a reward while retaining performance of the teacher model.

In summary, the key contribution is a principled and general distillation method for auto-regressive models that mitigates issues like distribution mismatch and model under-specification. The experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over prior distillation techniques on a diverse set of language tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), a method to transfer knowledge from a large auto-regressive teacher model to a smaller student model by optimizing divergences like reverse KL and generalized Jensen-Shannon on a mixture of teacher-generated and student-generated sequences.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on knowledge distillation for autoregressive models:

- The paper proposes a new method called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) that unifies and generalizes prior distillation techniques like supervised KD and on-policy distillation. GKD allows optimizing any divergence on a mixture of fixed and on-policy student-generated data.

- Most prior work on distilling autoregressive models uses supervised learning with a fixed dataset, which can lead to distribution mismatch between training and deployment. GKD mitigates this by using on-policy student-generated data.  

- The paper argues standard likelihood maximization objectives may be suboptimal due to model under-specification. GKD allows using alternative divergences like reverse KL or JSD that focus on generating student samples likely under the teacher.

- Experiments compare GKD to supervised KD, on-policy KD, and ImitKD on summarization, translation, and reasoning tasks. GKD variants consistently outperform prior methods, especially those using reverse KL or JSD.

- GKD is shown to enable knowledge transfer even with a tiny fraction of the original training data. It also combines well with RL fine-tuning for sequence-level optimization.

- Concurrent work on MiniLLM also recognizes issues with likelihood maximization but uses an RL approach. GKD provides a simpler supervised alternative with strong performance.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in formalizing and generalizing distillation for autoregressive models, mitigating distribution mismatch, using alternative divergences, extensive empirical comparisons, and combining distillation with RL fine-tuning. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GKD over common baselines on multiple language tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other KL-based divergences beyond forward KL, reverse KL and JSD for the GKD objective. The authors find that reverse KL and JSD with certain parameters work well, but there may be other divergences that are even better suited for distillation of auto-regressive models.

- Applying GKD to other modalities beyond text, such as image and speech generation models. The core ideas of GKD should apply to any auto-regressive generative model.

- Combining GKD with other techniques like attention transfer and hidden state matching. The authors currently only change the token distributions, but other techniques could further improve the distillation.

- Developing adaptive or learned schemes for automatically tuning the hyperparameters of GKD like the student data fraction and divergence beta. The optimal settings likely depend on the specific student-teacher model pair.

- Exploring whether GKD can enable extreme compression, e.g. compressing models by 100x or more while retaining performance. The authors achieve up to 38x compression but more aggressive compression may be possible.

- Applying GKD to large multi-task models like T0 or PALM to compress them for specific downstream tasks. The authors focus on single-task models currently.

- Combining GKD with other methods like pruning and quantization for end-to-end model compression. GKD compresses via distillation but could integrate other techniques.

- Extending GKD to settings like online/continual learning where the teacher itself is evolving. The authors assume a fixed pretrained teacher.

In summary, the authors propose several promising future directions to build on top of GKD and apply it to broader settings and models. The core ideas seem widely applicable beyond the specific instantiations explored in the paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), a method for distilling knowledge from a large auto-regressive teacher model into a smaller student model. GKD addresses two key challenges with distilling auto-regressive models: distribution mismatch between training and deployment, and model under-specification where the student is not expressive enough to fit the teacher. To handle distribution mismatch, GKD samples some output sequences from the student model during training. To address under-specification, GKD uses divergences like reverse KL and generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence that focus on generating student samples likely under the teacher. Experiments on summarization, translation, and math reasoning tasks show GKD outperforms common distillation methods like supervised distillation and on-policy distillation. Key benefits are improved data efficiency and handling limited student model capacity. The approach also combines well with RL fine-tuning for directly optimizing desired objectives beyond just mimicking the teacher.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) for compressing auto-regressive models like large language models (LLMs). GKD addresses two key issues with current distillation methods: 1) distribution mismatch between training and deployment, and 2) model under-specification where the student model may not be expressive enough to fit the teacher's distribution. 

To address distribution mismatch, GKD samples output sequences from the student model itself during training, similar to reinforcement learning and on-policy approaches. To handle model under-specification, GKD optimizes alternative divergences like reverse KL that focus on generating student samples likely under the teacher. Experiments on summarization, translation, and reasoning tasks show GKD outperforms common distillation baselines. Key benefits are improved data efficiency and handling limited student model capacity. The approach further combines well with reinforcement learning for sequence-level reward optimization. Overall, GKD provides an effective way to compress large auto-regressive models while retaining more of their capabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper proposes a knowledge distillation method called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) for compressing auto-regressive sequence models like language models. GKD unifies supervised and on-policy distillation approaches. It allows optimizing any divergence measure on a mixture of fixed dataset outputs and on-policy student-generated outputs. This mitigates issues of distribution mismatch and model under-specification in standard distillation methods. GKD generalizes prior distillation methods like on-policy distillation and ImitKD. It allows exploring different divergences like reverse KL and generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence, which can be more suitable for distillation than commonly used forward KL. Experiments on summarization, translation and arithmetic reasoning tasks show GKD outperforms standard distillation baselines. GKD also enables combining distillation with RL for optimizing rewards like factual consistency of summaries.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problems/questions it is trying to address are:

1. Current knowledge distillation methods for auto-regressive models like language models suffer from two key issues:

- Distribution mismatch between the sequences used during training and the ones generated by the student model during deployment. This is because training uses a fixed dataset of sequences while the student generates sequences on-policy during deployment.

- Model under-specification, where the student model may not have enough capacity to perfectly fit the teacher's distribution. Maximizing likelihood in this setting can lead to poor generative performance. 

2. How can we perform knowledge distillation for auto-regressive models like language models in a way that mitigates the above issues?

3. How does the proposed distillation approach, called Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), compare empirically to commonly used distillation methods like supervised and on-policy distillation on language tasks like summarization, translation and reasoning?

In summary, the key problem is developing better knowledge distillation techniques for compressing auto-regressive models like LLMs that address distribution mismatch and model under-specification limitations of current approaches. The paper proposes GKD to address this and evaluates it empirically on various language tasks.
