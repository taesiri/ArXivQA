# [Recognizability Embedding Enhancement for Very Low-Resolution Face   Recognition and Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to improve the recognizability of very low resolution (VLR) face images in the embedding space for more robust face recognition, especially for hard-to-recognize VLR faces. The key hypothesis is that pushing hard-to-recognize VLR face embeddings away from the "unrecognizable identities" (UIs) cluster and attending to the most recognizable face regions will enhance the recognizability of VLR faces. This improves face recognition performance, particularly for challenging VLR-VLR and HR-VLR matching scenarios.In summary, the main research question is how to improve VLR face recognizability in the embedding space. The key hypothesis is that diverting hard-to-recognize VLR faces away from the UIs cluster and applying perceptibility attention will increase VLR face recognizability and recognition performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach to address the very low-resolution face recognition (VLRFR) problem by improving the recognizability of hard-to-recognize faces in the embedding space. The key points are:- Formulating a robust learning-based face recognizability measure called Recognizability Index (RI) based on the proximity of each face embedding against the unrecognizable faces cluster and its positive/negative prototypes. - Devising an Index Diversion (ID) loss to push hard-to-recognize faces away from the unrecognizable cluster to enhance their RI.- Introducing a perceptibility attention mechanism to attend to the most recognizable face regions for better discriminative embeddings. - The proposed model serves both recognizability-aware embedding learning and face quality estimation in an end-to-end manner.- Evaluations on three challenging low-resolution datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for both very low-resolution face recognition and face image quality assessment tasks.In summary, the key novelty is improving hard-to-recognize faces based on the notion of recognizability rather than just visual quality, and quantifying recognizability with the proposed RI metric. This allows enhancing the discriminative power of embeddings for VLRFR.
