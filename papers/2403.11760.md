# [3R-INN: How to be climate friendly while consuming/delivering videos?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Consuming and distributing video contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change due to the energy required at each stage (encoding, transmission, decoding, display). 
- Reducing the end-to-end carbon footprint of video while preserving quality of experience is an important challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a single lightweight deep learning model called 3R-INN that performs three tasks simultaneously: 
   1) Downscale a high-resolution (HR) grainy image to a lower resolution (LR)
   2) Remove film grain noise
   3) Reduce display energy consumption by a specified percentage
- The model is invertible, meaning the original HR grainy image can be reconstructed from the LR output without needing to transmit additional data. 
- The forward pass generates a minimum viable quality LR image that consumes less energy to encode, transmit, decode and display. The invertible capability allows recovering the original if needed.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end solution to reduce video carbon footprint across encoding, transmission, decoding and display
- Outperforms state of the art in film grain synthesis without needing auxiliary data
- Achieves state of the art in image downscaling and display energy reduction tasks
- Disentangles film grain and detail loss in a conditional latent code for high quality HR reconstruction 
- Single lightweight model replacing three separate networks reduces processing energy 

The paper demonstrates significant energy savings of up to 78% for encoding, 77% for decoding and 5-20% for display with high visual quality. The model contributes meaningfully towards reducing the climate impact of video distribution while preserving quality.
