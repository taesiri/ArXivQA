# [On the Privacy of Selection Mechanisms with Gaussian Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06137)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Differential privacy mechanisms like Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold are commonly used for private query selection. With Laplace noise, pure differential privacy guarantees are straightforward. But with Gaussian noise, which has better utility, only approximate DP guarantees have been shown even though the outputs are discrete. 

- For Gaussian Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold, can we derive pure differential privacy guarantees under the assumption that the queries are bounded? This could lead to tighter privacy accounting.

Proposed Solution:

- For Gaussian Report Noisy Max, the paper shows that under the assumption of bounded queries, it is possible to derive a pure DP guarantee that depends on the query range. This guarantee can be computed numerically, albeit without a closed form.

- For Gaussian Above Threshold, the paper derives a pure ex-post differential privacy guarantee, which depends on the output produced by the mechanism. This guarantee can be computed in closed form. 

- The paper proposes a composition technique called Filtered Self-Reporting Composition (FSRC) that allows adaptive composition of Above Threshold mechanisms with ex-post DP guarantees. This removes the need to pre-specify parameters like max queries.

Main Contributions:

- First pure DP bounds for Gaussian Report Noisy Max and Gaussian Above Threshold under bounded queries assumption

- Numerical evaluation shows bounds lead to improved privacy accounting in high privacy, low data regime

- FSRC mechanism for fully adaptive composition of Above Threshold without specifying max queries a priori

- Experiments on mobility and energy data showing improved utility of Gaussian Above Threshold with ex-post accounting, compared to baselines

In summary, the paper provides the first pure DP analyses for Gaussian selection mechanisms, as well as adaptive composition tools. This leads to better privacy accounting and improved practical performance.
