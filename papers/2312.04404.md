# [On the Impact of Multi-dimensional Local Differential Privacy on   Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04404)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the impact of local differential privacy (LDP) on fairness when training machine learning models. The authors apply randomized response, a popular LDP mechanism, to obfuscate sensitive attributes in one synthetic and two real-world datasets. They systematically vary the privacy level, evaluate multiple group fairness metrics, and compare independent versus combined obfuscation of multi-dimensional sensitive data. The key findings are: (1) Increased privacy leads to reduced disparity between groups, with multi-dimensional LDP being more efficient than single attribute LDP. (2) For high privacy budgets, the combined approach works better when attributes are highly interdependent, while independent perturbation works better otherwise. (3) The relative impact of LDP on the accuracy/fairness of privileged versus unprivileged groups heavily depends on the distribution of the prediction outcome. Based on the observations, the authors provide concrete recommendations for practitioners aiming to balance privacy, fairness and utility when collecting sensitive data for ML applications.
