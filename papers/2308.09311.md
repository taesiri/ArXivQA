# [Lip Reading for Low-resource Languages by Learning and Combining General   Speech Knowledge and Language-specific Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop effective lip reading models for low-resource languages that do not have large amounts of paired video-text data? The key hypothesis is that learning and combining general speech knowledge (modeling of speech units/visemes) from a high-resource language along with language-specific knowledge from audio-text data can allow building good lip reading models for low-resource languages.In summary, the main research goals are:- Develop lip reading models for low-resource languages where limited video-text data is available.- Learn general speech knowledge by training on speech unit prediction from a high-resource language (English) which can transfer across languages. - Learn language-specific knowledge by training a novel decoder (LMDecoder) on audio-text data in the target language.- Combine the general speech and language-specific knowledge to build effective lip reading models for low-resource languages.The central hypothesis is that learning and combining these two different kinds of knowledge can overcome the limitation of small video-text datasets for low-resource lip reading.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel lip reading framework, especially for low-resource languages. The key ideas are:- Learning general speech knowledge from a high-resource language (English) by training a visual encoder to predict speech units from lip movements through masked prediction. This captures the ability to model speech units from lips.- Learning language-specific knowledge by proposing a Language-specific Memory-augmented Decoder (LMDecoder). The LMDecoder can be trained on audio-text paired data which is more accessible than video-text data. It learns to translate speech units into language-specific audio features using a memory bank.- Combining the general speech knowledge (from visual encoder) and language-specific knowledge (from LMDecoder) to build effective lip reading models even for low-resource languages.The paper shows through experiments on 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) that this approach of learning and combining the two knowledge sources works better than other methods for low-resource lip reading. The framework is also shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on English.In summary, the key contribution is a novel training framework to develop lip reading models for low-resource languages by effectively utilizing available data sources - visual data of a high-resource language for general speech knowledge and audio-text data of target language for language-specific knowledge.
