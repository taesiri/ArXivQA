# [Aircraft Landing Time Prediction with Deep Learning on Trajectory Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Aircraft landing time (ALT) prediction is important for air traffic management, especially for arrival sequencing and scheduling. However, ALT prediction is challenging due to factors like traffic conditions, weather, runway operations, and air traffic control actions like holding aircraft in stacks.

- Existing works utilize handcrafted features from trajectory data or time-series trajectory data directly. But these methods require complex feature engineering and cannot effectively capture spatial relationships and patterns. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a deep learning based ALT prediction method using trajectory images to capture spatial aircraft information. 

- Define a research airspace circle (TRC) of 50NM from airport. When an aircraft enters TRC, generate a trajectory image marking target aircraft in red and others in blue over a time window.

- Images contain aircraft position, speed, heading, zone, distances, and capture arrival traffic flows. Enable using CNNs without much feature engineering.

- Design CNN module to automatically extract holding-related features like gap with leading aircraft. Outputs fed into final ALT prediction model. 

- Apply state-of-the-art CNNs like MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet for ALT regression and holding probability classification.

- End-to-end model takes trajectory images, holding features, runway usage, weather data and aircraft data as input.

Contributions:
- Propose trajectory image representation to replace feature engineering and enable spatial pattern learning for ALT prediction.

- Design holding featurization module integrated in end-to-end model to improve prediction accuracy.

- Conduct case study on Singapore Changi Airport using ADS-B, weather and operations data.

- Achieve 79.4% predictions within 60 secs error. Holding module reduces mean absolute error from 82 secs to 44 secs over baseline.

In summary, this paper presents a deep learning based aircraft landing time prediction method using trajectory images and a holding featurization module to effectively capture spatial and temporal patterns. The integrated end-to-end approach shows significant gains over baseline methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep learning-based aircraft landing time prediction method that uses trajectory images and a holding featurization module to achieve higher accuracy, reducing mean absolute error from 82 to 44 seconds on Singapore Changi Airport data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized in the paper as follows:

1. Trajectory images are proposed to be generated and utilized in the ALT modeling. These images can capture the aircraft's position, speed, heading, entry zone, arrival traffic flow, and relative distances among airborne flights. The trajectory image generation can reduce efforts in complex feature engineering, and enable the use of state-of-the-art CNNs for the ALT prediction problem.

2. A CNN-based module is designed for automatic holding-related feature engineering. This module takes the generated images, as well as the leading aircraft holding status, time/speed gap with the leading aircraft at TRC, and speed variation at TRC as input. Its output is fed into the final ALT prediction to make it capable of capturing holding-related features, resulting in an end-to-end ALT prediction model.

3. The proposed ALT prediction approach is applied to the case study of Singapore Changi Airport using one-month ADS-B data. Results show the method can achieve 96.1% average accuracy, with 79.4% of prediction errors less than 60 seconds. Incorporating the holding featurization module reduces mean absolute error from 82.23 to 43.96 seconds, and bad prediction ratio from 1.56% to 0.25%.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an end-to-end deep learning framework for aircraft landing time prediction, which utilizes automatically generated trajectory images and an additional module to capture holding-related features. This approach achieves improved prediction accuracy compared to baselines.
