# [Collaborating with language models for embodied reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00763)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can large language models (LLMs) be leveraged to provide reasoning and planning capabilities to embodied reinforcement learning agents? 

The key hypothesis is that combining LLMs with embodied RL agents in a "Planner-Actor-Reporter" setup can allow leveraging the complementary strengths of LLMs (reasoning, generalizability) and RL agents (ability to take actions and perceive the environment). The paper investigates this through tasks requiring reasoning, generalization, exploration, and communication between the LLM planner and embodied actor mediated by the reporter module.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing and evaluating a paradigm for Embodied AI agents that combines complementary strengths of large language models (reasoning abilities) and reinforcement learning agents (ability to act in environments). 

Specifically, it proposes a framework with three components:

- A Planner module implemented as a large pre-trained language model that can reason about tasks and break them down into simpler step-by-step natural language instructions.

- An Actor module implemented as a reinforcement learning agent that can follow simple instructions and take actions in the environment. 

- A Reporter module that translates information from the environment back to natural language for the Planner module.

The key ideas are:

- Leveraging large language models as interactive Planners that can reason about tasks and adaptively plan based on environment feedback.

- Introducing a series of tasks requiring reasoning, exploration, and information gathering.

- Analyzing the performance and failure cases of different sized language models on these tasks.

- Showing that the Reporter module can be trained via RL to communicate optimally with the Planner, rather than being hand-coded.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing this Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm for combining reasoning and embodiment, evaluating it on information gathering tasks, and showing the promise of learning the Reporter module. The results demonstrate that this approach can accomplish complex behaviors zero-shot by leveraging large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces a Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm for embodied reasoning, where a pre-trained language model serves as the Planner to logically reason and issue instructions, a simple RL agent acts as the Actor to follow instructions, and the Reporter translates environment information back to the Planner. The key ideas are leveraging language models for complex reasoning while keeping the Actor simple, and introducing tasks requiring explicit information gathering and reporting. The main result is showing this paradigm can achieve strong zero-shot performance on reasoning tasks, and training the Reporter with RL is viable.

In one sentence: The paper demonstrates combining language models for reasoning with simple RL agents for embodiment, through a Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm, for complex embodied reasoning tasks involving information gathering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other work in using language models for embodied reasoning:

- The use of a Planner-Actor-Reporter framework is a nice generalization of other recent approaches like CAN and Socratic that also use language models to guide embodied agents. Framing it this way highlights the different roles each component plays.

- Focusing on tasks requiring explicit information gathering is a good testbed. Previous work has looked more at complex step-by-step instructions, whereas having the language model itself direct exploration and integrate findings is an interesting extension.

- Analyzing different sized LMs is useful - confirms larger is more capable but smaller models still show promise. Examining failure modes also provides insight.

- Showing the Reporter can be trained with RL is novel. Other recent work has relied more on pre-trained perception modules. Demonstrating the viability of learning the Reporter end-to-end helps point the way to fully learned models.

- The tasks and environment are still quite simple compared to real-world settings other work tackles. But the controlled setup enables clearer analysis of the reasoning abilities. Testing the approach in more complex and realistic environments is an important next step.

Overall, I'd say this work provides a nice synthesis and extension of recent trends in using language models for embodied reasoning. The analysis is thorough and it helpfully points towards fully learned models as an exciting direction for future work. Testing the limits of these methods in more complex and diverse environments will be key. But this provides a solid conceptual and empirical foundation to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding to more complex and realistic embodied reasoning tasks. The tasks explored in this work are relatively simple gridworld environments. The authors suggest expanding to more complex 3D environments and tasks that require more intricate reasoning and exploration. 

- Improving training with a large language model in the loop. Training the Reporter module end-to-end with reinforcement learning is computationally expensive due to the inference cost of querying the language model Planner at each timestep. The authors suggest ways to make this training more efficient.

- Incorporating pre-trained components into the Reporter module. The authors propose combining pre-trained perception and grounding models as a way to bootstrap the Reporter, before finetuning it with RL to communicate optimally with the Planner.

- Exploring different Planner-Actor-Reporter configurations. The authors establish this three-module paradigm but suggest exploring other variants, like having multiple Actors or hierarchical Planners.

- Improving language generation from the Reporter. The authors used simple fixed text options for the Reporter, but suggest allowing more flexible language generation.

- Studying whether the Planner can learn improved reasoning behaviors through the task interactions. The Planner was fixed in this work, but the authors propose it could also be updated.

In summary, the main future directions focus on scaling up the complexity of tasks, improving the training efficiency and capabilities of the Reporter, and exploring different arrangements of the Planner-Actor-Reporter framework. The overarching goal is moving towards more practical real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm for combining the reasoning abilities of large language models with the embodied capabilities of RL agents. The Planner module is a pretrained language model that can reason about complex tasks and break them down into simpler step-by-step instructions. These instructions are executed by the Actor module, which is an RL agent trained on basic skills like navigation and object manipulation. To enable closed-loop communication, the Reporter module translates the Actor's observations back into language representations that the Planner can understand. The authors demonstrate this system on novel "search" and "conditional" tasks that require explicit information gathering by the Actor, reasoning by the Planner based on the gathered information, and truthful reporting by the Reporter. They show that large language model Planners exhibit effective zero-shot performance on these tasks, and are robust to imperfections in the Actor and Reporter. The authors also show a proof-of-concept for training the Reporter end-to-end using RL, optimizing the communication between Planner and Actor. Overall, the proposed paradigm provides a way to combine the complementary strengths of language models and RL agents.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a three-part system for embodied reasoning, consisting of a Planner, an Actor, and a Reporter. The Planner is a large language model that can reason abstractly and break down complex tasks into step-by-step instructions. The Actor is a reinforcement learning agent that can execute simple instructions from the Planner in an embodied 2D grid world environment. The Reporter translates observations from the environment back into language so the Planner can incorporate that information into future instructions. 

The authors introduce novel "conditional" and "search" tasks that require gathering information from the environment before the next step can be determined. They show that large language model Planners (70B parameters) can succeed on these tasks zero-shot when paired with a pre-trained Actor and hard-coded Reporter. The authors also demonstrate a proof-of-concept training method for the Reporter module, where it learns from episode rewards to communicate visual properties like object locations back to the Planner. While there are still challenges around scaling up the environments, tasks, and training, this work shows the promise of combining language models, embodied agents, and learned communication to achieve complex embodied reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm for embodied reasoning tasks. The Planner is a pre-trained large language model that provides reasoning and breaks down complex tasks into simple instructions. It operates over language observations and actions. The Actor is a reinforcement learning agent that can execute basic instructions like movement and object manipulation in a 2D grid environment. It operates over pixel observations and environment actions. The Reporter module translates between these, taking the Actor's observations and actions and converting them to language reports for the Planner. The authors show that this framework can achieve good zero-shot performance on tasks requiring reasoning, exploration, and information gathering. They also demonstrate that the Reporter can be trained from scratch using reinforcement learning to optimize communicating task-relevant information back to the Planner. Key to the approach is the complementary abilities provided by the pre-trained reasoning capacity of the language model Planner and the ability of the Actor agent to actually take actions and gather information in the environment. The Reporter facilitates passing the right information between them.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper is addressing the challenge of combining logical reasoning abilities of large language models with the ability of reinforcement learning agents to take actions and perceive in an embodied environment. The authors propose a framework with three components - a Planner (large language model), an Actor (reinforcement learning agent), and a Reporter - to collaborate in solving reasoning tasks in an embodied gridworld environment. The key ideas seem to be:

- Using the language model as a Planner to break down complex tasks into simpler step-by-step instructions

- The Actor follows these instructions and takes actions in the environment 

- The Reporter translates observations from the environment back to natural language for the Planner 

- This allows the system to leverage strengths of both large language models (reasoning) and RL agents (embodied actions and perception)

- The authors design tasks requiring information gathering and conditional logic that play to these strengths

- They analyze the performance and failure cases of different sized language models as the Planner

- And show a proof-of-concept of training the Reporter module with RL to improve collaboration

So in summary, the key problem is how to combine reasoning abilities of LMs with embodiment of RL agents, in order to solve complex tasks requiring both logical reasoning and environment interaction. The Planner-Actor-Reporter framework is proposed as a way to achieve this collaboration.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates how to combine the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LSLMs) with the ability to interact in an embodied environment, which LSLMs lack. The authors propose a framework consisting of three components: a Planner (the LSLM), an Actor (a simple RL agent), and a Reporter. The Planner issues high-level natural language instructions to the Actor to accomplish tasks in a 2D gridworld environment. The Reporter sends information back to the Planner about the environment and the Actor's actions. The authors introduce tasks requiring explicit information gathering and multistep reasoning that leverage the LSLM's abilities. They show strong zero-shot task performance from the framework, analyze the LSLM's failure cases, and demonstrate how to train the Reporter module with RL. Key results are that larger LSLM Planners (70B parameters) substantially outperform smaller ones (7B), and that the framework is fairly robust to imperfections in the Actor and Reporter. This work provides a promising approach to combining complementary reasoning and embodied capabilities in a single agent.
