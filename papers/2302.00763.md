# Collaborating with language models for embodied reasoning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models (LLMs) be leveraged to provide reasoning and planning capabilities to embodied reinforcement learning agents? The key hypothesis is that combining LLMs with embodied RL agents in a "Planner-Actor-Reporter" setup can allow leveraging the complementary strengths of LLMs (reasoning, generalizability) and RL agents (ability to take actions and perceive the environment). The paper investigates this through tasks requiring reasoning, generalization, exploration, and communication between the LLM planner and embodied actor mediated by the reporter module.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing and evaluating a paradigm for Embodied AI agents that combines complementary strengths of large language models (reasoning abilities) and reinforcement learning agents (ability to act in environments). Specifically, it proposes a framework with three components:- A Planner module implemented as a large pre-trained language model that can reason about tasks and break them down into simpler step-by-step natural language instructions.- An Actor module implemented as a reinforcement learning agent that can follow simple instructions and take actions in the environment. - A Reporter module that translates information from the environment back to natural language for the Planner module.The key ideas are:- Leveraging large language models as interactive Planners that can reason about tasks and adaptively plan based on environment feedback.- Introducing a series of tasks requiring reasoning, exploration, and information gathering.- Analyzing the performance and failure cases of different sized language models on these tasks.- Showing that the Reporter module can be trained via RL to communicate optimally with the Planner, rather than being hand-coded.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing this Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm for combining reasoning and embodiment, evaluating it on information gathering tasks, and showing the promise of learning the Reporter module. The results demonstrate that this approach can accomplish complex behaviors zero-shot by leveraging large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces a Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm for embodied reasoning, where a pre-trained language model serves as the Planner to logically reason and issue instructions, a simple RL agent acts as the Actor to follow instructions, and the Reporter translates environment information back to the Planner. The key ideas are leveraging language models for complex reasoning while keeping the Actor simple, and introducing tasks requiring explicit information gathering and reporting. The main result is showing this paradigm can achieve strong zero-shot performance on reasoning tasks, and training the Reporter with RL is viable.In one sentence: The paper demonstrates combining language models for reasoning with simple RL agents for embodiment, through a Planner-Actor-Reporter paradigm, for complex embodied reasoning tasks involving information gathering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other work in using language models for embodied reasoning:- The use of a Planner-Actor-Reporter framework is a nice generalization of other recent approaches like CAN and Socratic that also use language models to guide embodied agents. Framing it this way highlights the different roles each component plays.- Focusing on tasks requiring explicit information gathering is a good testbed. Previous work has looked more at complex step-by-step instructions, whereas having the language model itself direct exploration and integrate findings is an interesting extension.- Analyzing different sized LMs is useful - confirms larger is more capable but smaller models still show promise. Examining failure modes also provides insight.- Showing the Reporter can be trained with RL is novel. Other recent work has relied more on pre-trained perception modules. Demonstrating the viability of learning the Reporter end-to-end helps point the way to fully learned models.- The tasks and environment are still quite simple compared to real-world settings other work tackles. But the controlled setup enables clearer analysis of the reasoning abilities. Testing the approach in more complex and realistic environments is an important next step.Overall, I'd say this work provides a nice synthesis and extension of recent trends in using language models for embodied reasoning. The analysis is thorough and it helpfully points towards fully learned models as an exciting direction for future work. Testing the limits of these methods in more complex and diverse environments will be key. But this provides a solid conceptual and empirical foundation to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding to more complex and realistic embodied reasoning tasks. The tasks explored in this work are relatively simple gridworld environments. The authors suggest expanding to more complex 3D environments and tasks that require more intricate reasoning and exploration. - Improving training with a large language model in the loop. Training the Reporter module end-to-end with reinforcement learning is computationally expensive due to the inference cost of querying the language model Planner at each timestep. The authors suggest ways to make this training more efficient.- Incorporating pre-trained components into the Reporter module. The authors propose combining pre-trained perception and grounding models as a way to bootstrap the Reporter, before finetuning it with RL to communicate optimally with the Planner.- Exploring different Planner-Actor-Reporter configurations. The authors establish this three-module paradigm but suggest exploring other variants, like having multiple Actors or hierarchical Planners.- Improving language generation from the Reporter. The authors used simple fixed text options for the Reporter, but suggest allowing more flexible language generation.- Studying whether the Planner can learn improved reasoning behaviors through the task interactions. The Planner was fixed in this work, but the authors propose it could also be updated.In summary, the main future directions focus on scaling up the complexity of tasks, improving the training efficiency and capabilities of the Reporter, and exploring different arrangements of the Planner-Actor-Reporter framework. The overarching goal is moving towards more practical real-world applications.
