# [FrugalGPT: How to Use Large Language Models While Reducing Cost and   Improving Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05176)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we use large language models (LLMs) more efficiently and cost-effectively, while maintaining or improving performance on downstream natural language tasks? The key hypothesis is that by using techniques like prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascades, it is possible to significantly reduce the cost of using LLMs while matching or exceeding the performance of the best individual LLM.In more detail:- The paper notes that while large LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 achieve great performance on NLP tasks, using them can be very expensive at scale due to their computational demands. - It proposes three main strategies to address this:  1) Prompt adaptation to use shorter, more efficient prompts  2) LLM approximation to replace expensive LLMs with cheaper alternatives   3) LLM cascades to selectively choose which LLMs to query for each input- The central hypothesis is that by combining these techniques, such as through the proposed FrugalGPT system, users can cut costs substantially (e.g. 95-98% reduction) while matching or exceeding the accuracy of the best individual LLM.So in summary, the key research question is how to efficiently leverage LLMs to minimize cost while preserving/improving accuracy, with the hypothesis that techniques like prompt adaptation, approximation, and cascades can achieve this goal. The FrugalGPT system is presented as an implementation of these ideas.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called FrugalGPT for using large language model (LLM) APIs efficiently and cost-effectively. The key ideas are:- Prompt adaptation: Using shorter prompts to reduce costs. Examples are prompt selection and query concatenation. - LLM approximation: Approximating expensive LLM APIs with cheaper alternatives like caching completions or fine-tuning smaller models.- LLM cascade: Adaptively selecting which LLMs to query for different inputs based on their strengths/weaknesses.The paper demonstrates these ideas through a simple LLM cascade model called FrugalGPT. Key results on real LLM APIs like GPT-3/4 and ChatGPT show FrugalGPT can match the best individual LLM's accuracy with up to 98% cost reduction or improve accuracy by 4% with the same cost.Overall, the paper provides a useful conceptual framework and promising empirical evidence for efficiently leveraging multiple LLM APIs under budget constraints. The ideas could enable more affordable and sustainable LLM usage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes strategies like prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascade to reduce the inference cost and improve the performance of using large language model APIs under budget constraints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on frugal strategies for using large language models compares to other related work:- Focus on inference cost reduction: This paper focuses specifically on reducing the inference cost of using large language models (LLMs), as opposed to much prior work that looks at reducing training costs or model sizes. The emphasis on inference cost is timely given the emergence of commercial LLM APIs.- Leveraging multiple LLM APIs: A unique aspect of this work is the proposal to leverage and combine multiple commercial LLM APIs, rather than relying on a single in-house LLM. This allows tapping into the heterogeneity of the LLM marketplace.- Query-level optimization: The techniques aim to optimize cost on a per-query basis by routing queries to different LLM APIs. This fine-grained optimization is different from model-level compression or distillation techniques.- Model-agnostic methods: The proposed techniques like prompt adaptation and LLM cascades treat the LLM APIs as black boxes. This contrasts with model-centric methods like weight pruning that require whitebox access.- Focus on generative tasks: Much prior work looks at compressing LLMs for discriminative tasks like classification. This paper targets generative query answering where both prompts and generations impact cost.- Vision paper: This is more of a vision paper outlining promising directions rather than an empirical contribution. The preliminary results help ground the ideas but more extensive empirical validation is needed.Overall, the focus on query-level cost reduction using multiple commercial LLMs sets this apart from works on model compression, distillation, and optimization. The ideas could open up new ways to sustainably leverage LLMs in real-world applications. More empirical exploration is needed to fully validate the proposed techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Incorporating other factors like latency, fairness, privacy, and environmental impact into the optimization framework for using LLMs under budget constraints. The current work focuses primarily on balancing performance and cost, but real-world applications need to consider these other factors as well. - Quantifying uncertainty in LLM-generated outputs, especially for risk-critical applications. As LLMs are deployed more widely, properly capturing the uncertainty in their predictions becomes important.- Addressing the environmental ramifications of training and deploying large LLMs through joint efforts of users and API providers. As LLMs grow in size, their carbon footprint becomes substantial. More research is needed on sustainable AI practices.- Exploring creative applications of LLMs beyond objective text generation tasks studied in this paper. The authors acknowledge that their current focus on natural language query answering limits the scope.- Developing enhanced prompt engineering techniques to reduce costs, such as automating prompt search.- Studying model compression techniques like knowledge distillation to create cheaper LLM approximations.- Expanding the LLM selection framework to incorporate latency and throughput constraints.- Optimizing attention computation and other intrinsic operations within LLMs to improve efficiency.In summary, the key future directions relate to expanding the optimization objective, supporting risk-critical applications, improving sustainability, enhancing prompt engineering, model approximation, system optimization, and creative usage of LLMs. The field is rapidly evolving and new challenges and opportunities will likely emerge.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes FrugalGPT, a framework for using large language model (LLM) APIs more efficiently. The authors identify three main strategies for reducing LLM inference costs: prompt adaptation (using shorter prompts), LLM approximation (replacing expensive LLMs with cheaper alternatives), and LLM cascade (adaptively selecting different LLMs for each query). They focus on LLM cascade, where queries are sent to a sequence of LLM APIs, stopping once one generates a sufficiently confident response. FrugalGPT learns which LLMs to use in which order, and when to stop querying. Experiments on several datasets show FrugalGPT matches the accuracy of the best individual LLM (like GPT-4) while reducing costs by up to 98%. The paper argues FrugalGPT lays the groundwork for sustainable and affordable use of LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper outlines strategies to reduce the inference cost of using large language model (LLM) APIs while maintaining or even improving performance. The authors identify three main approaches: prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascade. Prompt adaptation involves using shorter, more concise prompts to reduce the query cost. LLM approximation aims to mimic expensive LLMs with cheaper models, for example by caching responses or fine-tuning smaller models. LLM cascade sends a query through a sequence of LLMs, stopping when one generates a sufficiently reliable response. To demonstrate these ideas, the authors implement a simple LLM cascade system called FrugalGPT. It learns to route queries to different LLMs like GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 based on predicted cost and reliability. Experiments on news, legal, and reading comprehension datasets show FrugalGPT matches the best individual LLM's accuracy with 50-98% cost reduction. It also improves accuracy by up to 5% with the same cost budget. The authors argue these strategies lay the groundwork for more affordable and performant LLM usage. Limitations include needing some labeled data and training costs for the cascade.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes FrugalGPT, a system that aims to reduce the cost and improve the performance of using large language model (LLM) APIs. The key idea is to use three strategies - prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascade. Prompt adaptation involves using shorter prompts to reduce costs.
