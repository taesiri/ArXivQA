# [Exploring the Impact of Table-to-Text Methods on Augmenting LLM-based   Question Answering with Domain Hybrid Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Enhancing large language models (LLMs) for question answering in domain-specific areas is important, but domain data often exists in a hybrid format of both text and tables. 
- Effectively integrating this heterogeneous data into LLMs is challenging. Table-to-text generation can transform hybrid data into text format, but there is no analysis on how different table-to-text methods impact QA system performance.

Methodology:
- Proposes a framework to integrate table-to-text generation into enhancing LLM-based QA systems with domain hybrid data. 
- Uses this framework to comprehensively compare four table-to-text methods (Markdown, Template, TPLM-based, LLM-based) on two QA systems (DSFT and RAG paradigms).
- Experiments conducted on real-world industrial ICT domain data collected into a dataset called ICT-DATA. A corresponding benchmark ICTQA is created.

Key Findings:
- Table-to-text methods significantly impact QA system performance, with score differences ranging 2.8-9.0% (human evaluation) and 4.8-16% (GPT-4 evaluation). Proper selection brings considerable benefits.
- In DSFT, LLM-based and TPLM-based consistently outperform others. In RAG, LLM-based still excellent but Markdown unexpectedly effective too.
- Varying frequencies of domain terms/verbs and differing semantic quality of generated text appear to be pivotal influential factors causing performance disparities.

Contributions:
- First work to comprehensively compare table-to-text strategies on LLM QA systems enhanced by hybrid data.
- Provides empirical findings on the superiority of certain methods. Uncovers underlying reasons behind performance differences.
- Offers practical suggestions for selecting methods based on frameworks and resources.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper explores the impact of different table-to-text generation methods on augmenting large language model-based question answering systems with domain hybrid data, finding that the methods significantly affect performance and that LLM-based and TPLM-based approaches consistently outperform others for domain-specific fine-tuning while the LLM-based and Markdown methods excel for retrieval-augmented generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper innovatively integrates table-to-text generation into the framework of enhancing LLM-based QA systems with domain hybrid data. It then utilizes this framework to conduct extensive experiments on two types of QA systems (DSFT and RAG paradigms) with four representative table-to-text methods (Markdown, Template, TPLM-based, and LLM-based). Through analysis and experiments, the paper provides several key findings:

1) Table-to-text methods significantly impact the performance of QA systems, with relative score differences ranging from 2.8% to 9.0% in human evaluation and 4.8% to 16% in GPT-4 evaluation. 

2) In the DSFT paradigm, LLM-based and TPLM-based methods consistently outperform others across models, demonstrating their superiority. In the RAG paradigm, the LLM-based method still performs excellently while the Markdown format shows unexpected effectiveness.

3) The varying frequency of domain-specific terms and verbs produced by these methods, and the differing quality of semantic representations in the generated text chunks appear to be key factors influencing performance disparities across the two QA system paradigms.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights and guidance regarding selecting appropriate table-to-text strategies when building robust QA systems enhanced by domain hybrid data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Table-to-text generation - Converting tables into coherent natural language text descriptions.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Advanced neural network models like GPT-3 that are pretrained on large volumes of text data.  

- Question answering (QA) - Building systems that can accurately answer questions based on a knowledge source.

- Domain adaptation - Tailoring language models to perform better on domain-specific data.  

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) - Using retrieved knowledge to help language models generate responses.

- Domain-specific fine-tuning (DSFT) - Further pretraining LLMs on in-domain datasets.

- Hybrid data - Data consisting of both free text and more structured tabular data.

- Markdown format - A simple text-based format for tables. 

- Template serialization - Using pre-defined templates to convert tables to text.

- TPLM-based method - Leveraging pretrained language models made for table-to-text conversion.  

- LLM-based method - Using capabilities of general large language models for this task.

So in summary, the key focus is on analyzing different techniques to convert tabular data to text in order to better leverage hybrid document collections, and assessing the impact on domain question answering.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes integrating table-to-text generation into the framework of enhancing QA systems with domain hybrid data. What are the key benefits and potential drawbacks of this approach compared to handling text and tables separately?

2. The paper experiments with QA systems under two paradigms - Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning (DSFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). What are the key differences in how these paradigms utilize the generated text corpora and how does this impact the choice of table-to-text methods?  

3. The paper finds that in the DSFT paradigm, the LLM-based and TPLM-based table-to-text methods consistently outperform others. What factors contribute to their superior performance in this paradigm?

4. For the RAG paradigm, Markdown formatting unexpectedly shows effectiveness comparable to the LLM-based method. What underlying reasons could explain Markdown's unexpectedly good performance?

5. The paper suggests that domain term frequency and diversity of verbs correlate with model performance, especially in the DSFT paradigm. How could this finding be leveraged to further optimize table-to-text methods for QA systems?  

6. Could the lower resource requirements of Markdown and Template serialization methods make them favorable over LLM-based methods in certain real-world settings? What trade-offs need consideration here?

7. The paper finds better query-document alignment for Markdown and LLM-based methods in the vector embedding space. How can this insight be used to optimize retrieval for the RAG paradigm?

8. For practical applications, what kind of guidance does this paper offer on selecting appropriate table-to-text methods based on the QA system paradigm and resources availability?

9. The paper focuses on the ICT domain. Would the superior methods remain consistent across other complex domains like scientific literature or medical data?

10. What future work could build on these findings to further close the performance gap between different table-to-text methods for QA systems? Are there still open challenges?
