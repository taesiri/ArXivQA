# [SafeDiffuser: Safe Planning with Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00148)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate safety guarantees into diffusion probabilistic models for safe planning. Specifically, the paper proposes methods to ensure that trajectories generated by diffusion models satisfy desired safety specifications and constraints. The key hypothesis is that by embedding control-theoretic notions of finite-time invariance into the diffusion procedure, the researchers can enable safe and trustworthy data generation from diffusion models.The paper aims to address the lack of safety guarantees in existing diffusion model approaches for data-driven planning tasks. It proposes techniques to formally guarantee satisfaction of specifications like obstacle avoidance at the end of the diffusion trajectory generation process. This would allow diffusion models to be reliably used for safety-critical planning applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a method called SafeDiffuser to provide safety guarantees for diffusion probabilistic models in planning tasks. 2. Introducing the concept of "finite-time diffusion invariance" and using control barrier functions to enforce it during the denoising diffusion procedure. This allows generating safe trajectories that satisfy desired specifications.3. Demonstrating three variants of SafeDiffuser - robust, relaxed, and time-varying - that address issues like local traps during planning.4. Evaluating SafeDiffuser on various planning tasks including maze navigation, robot locomotion, and 3D manipulation. Results show it can provide safety guarantees while preserving performance compared to vanilla diffusion models. 5. More broadly, the paper seems to propose a new way to equip data-driven generative models like diffusion models with formal safety guarantees. This is an important contribution for using such models in safety-critical applications.In summary, the core ideas appear to be using control theory concepts to ensure safety in probabilistic generative models, proposing methods to do this for diffusion models specifically, and demonstrating their effectiveness on robotic planning tasks. Providing formal safety guarantees for diffusion-based planning is the key contribution.
