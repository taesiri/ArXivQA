# [SafeDiffuser: Safe Planning with Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00148)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate safety guarantees into diffusion probabilistic models for safe planning. Specifically, the paper proposes methods to ensure that trajectories generated by diffusion models satisfy desired safety specifications and constraints. The key hypothesis is that by embedding control-theoretic notions of finite-time invariance into the diffusion procedure, the researchers can enable safe and trustworthy data generation from diffusion models.The paper aims to address the lack of safety guarantees in existing diffusion model approaches for data-driven planning tasks. It proposes techniques to formally guarantee satisfaction of specifications like obstacle avoidance at the end of the diffusion trajectory generation process. This would allow diffusion models to be reliably used for safety-critical planning applications.
