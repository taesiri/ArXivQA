# [SafeDiffuser: Safe Planning with Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00148)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate safety guarantees into diffusion probabilistic models for safe planning. Specifically, the paper proposes methods to ensure that trajectories generated by diffusion models satisfy desired safety specifications and constraints. The key hypothesis is that by embedding control-theoretic notions of finite-time invariance into the diffusion procedure, the researchers can enable safe and trustworthy data generation from diffusion models.The paper aims to address the lack of safety guarantees in existing diffusion model approaches for data-driven planning tasks. It proposes techniques to formally guarantee satisfaction of specifications like obstacle avoidance at the end of the diffusion trajectory generation process. This would allow diffusion models to be reliably used for safety-critical planning applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a method called SafeDiffuser to provide safety guarantees for diffusion probabilistic models in planning tasks. 2. Introducing the concept of "finite-time diffusion invariance" and using control barrier functions to enforce it during the denoising diffusion procedure. This allows generating safe trajectories that satisfy desired specifications.3. Demonstrating three variants of SafeDiffuser - robust, relaxed, and time-varying - that address issues like local traps during planning.4. Evaluating SafeDiffuser on various planning tasks including maze navigation, robot locomotion, and 3D manipulation. Results show it can provide safety guarantees while preserving performance compared to vanilla diffusion models. 5. More broadly, the paper seems to propose a new way to equip data-driven generative models like diffusion models with formal safety guarantees. This is an important contribution for using such models in safety-critical applications.In summary, the core ideas appear to be using control theory concepts to ensure safety in probabilistic generative models, proposing methods to do this for diffusion models specifically, and demonstrating their effectiveness on robotic planning tasks. Providing formal safety guarantees for diffusion-based planning is the key contribution.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in safe reinforcement learning and robot planning:- The main novelty of this paper is using control barrier functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees for diffusion models in robot planning tasks. CBFs have been used before to ensure safety in neural network controllers, but applying them to diffusion models is a new idea. - Most prior work on safe RL and planning has focused on modifying the optimization objective or reward function to encourage safety during training. This paper takes a very different approach by imposing safety constraints during the trajectory generation process.- The idea of embedding safety constraints into a generative model is novel. Prior generative models for planning like GANs or normalizing flows don't consider safety. The closest work is on constrained trajectory optimization, but that requires known system dynamics rather than a learned generative model.- The guarantees provided by CBFs are stronger than a lot of prior safety methods like constrained policy optimization that optimize a soft constraint penalty. The CBF approach provides deterministic guarantees on satisfying safety constraints.- The diffusion model itself builds on recent advances in denoising diffusion probabilistic models. So this paper can be seen as extending that line of generative modeling research to planning domains with a method to ensure safety.- Compared to other safety methods, the CBF approach does have a higher computational cost due to solving the QP at each step. But the paper shows it can still run at reasonable speeds for their robot experiments.Overall, I would say this paper makes a nice contribution in bridging safety-critical control theory with recent data-driven generative models for planning. The CBF approach seems promising for ensuring the safety of diffusion-based planners.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring how to learn specifications from historical trajectory data. The paper notes that specifications need to be expressed as continuously differentiable constraints, which may be unknown for planning tasks. The authors suggest further work could explore learning these specifications from data.- Investigating diffusion models for safe control policies when robot dynamics are known or can be learned. The paper points out there is a gap between planning with diffusion models and controlling real robotic systems. The authors propose future work on using diffusion models to generate safe control policies when dynamics models are available. - Applying the proposed methods to guarantee safety in other applications of diffusion models like image generation. The authors note their technique of finite-time diffusion invariance could also ensure desired patterns or objects are generated, and suggest exploring this direction.- Using stochastic differential equations which might be a better fit for the proposed techniques than the deterministic diffusion dynamics.- Addressing limitations like relying on differentiable specifications and handling more complex specifications. Expanding the applicability of the methods to less restricted classes of specifications.- Exploring combinations with other safety techniques like reachability analysis to provide stronger safety guarantees.In summary, the main suggested directions are: learning specifications from data, using dynamics models for control policies, expanding to other applications like image generation, using stochastic models, handling more complex specifications, and integrating with other safety methods. The core theme is enhancing the applicability and safety guarantees of the proposed techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes SafeDiffuser, a method to ensure diffusion probabilistic models satisfy specifications using control barrier functions. The key idea is to embed proposed finite-time diffusion invariance into the denoising diffusion procedure to enable trustworthy diffusion data generation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method called SafeDiffuser to ensure diffusion probabilistic models satisfy specifications using control barrier functions. Diffusion models like DALL-E have shown promise for data-driven planning tasks, but lack safety guarantees which limits their use in critical applications. The key idea is to embed proposed finite-time diffusion invariance into the denoising diffusion procedure to enable trustworthy data generation. This is achieved by finding dynamics of the diffusion procedure, then using control barrier functions to formally guarantee meeting specifications at the end. Several methods are proposed to avoid local traps that could otherwise prevent satisfying specifications.The method is tested on planning tasks including maze path generation, legged robot locomotion, and 3D manipulation. Results validate the advantages of robustness and safety guarantees compared to vanilla diffusion models on these tasks. Three safe diffuser variants are shown to avoid local traps during diffusion. The method matches theoretical potential both quantitatively and qualitatively. This fundamental enhancement of diffusion models with formal safety guarantees expands their possible applications to critical domains like robotics.
