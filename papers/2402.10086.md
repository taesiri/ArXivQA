# [Explainable AI for Safe and Trustworthy Autonomous Driving: A Systematic   Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great promise for autonomous driving (AD) but raises significant safety and trust issues due to its lack of transparency. There is an urgent need to develop safe and trustworthy AI for AD. Explainable AI (XAI) methods that provide human-understandable explanations of AI systems' decisions and behaviors could help address these issues. 

Proposed Solution: The paper conducts a systematic literature review to analyze the state-of-the-art XAI techniques applied to AD, focusing on environmental perception, planning and prediction, and control tasks. Based on 84 reviewed papers, the authors identify five paradigms of XAI contributions for safe and trustworthy AD:

1. Interpretable design: Designing inherently interpretable AI algorithms and models that provide transparency into the reasoning behind outputs. Examples include goal-based prediction models, concept-based neural networks, etc.

2. Interpretable surrogate models: Approximating complex black box AI models with simpler, interpretable models like decision trees to explain decisions.

3. Interpretable monitoring: Runtime verification of AI module outputs using interpretable methods to ensure safety. Examples include decision tree based monitors. 

4. Auxiliary explanations: Generating additional explanatory outputs like attention maps and heatmaps to highlight important input regions.

5. Interpretable validation: Using interpretable methods to generate adversarial validation scenarios and agent behaviors.

The authors also propose an XAI framework called SafeX that integrates the above techniques to enable both safety monitoring and explanation delivery for AD systems.

Main Contributions:

- First comprehensive systematic literature review of XAI applied to perception, planning, prediction and control in AD

- Identification of five paradigms of XAI techniques and their applications to safe and trustworthy AD

- Proposal of a novel XAI framework SafeX that combines multiple XAI techniques in a layered, modular fashion to ensure safety and provide explanations

- Analysis of gaps and recommendations for future XAI research directions in AD

In summary, this paper makes important contributions towards developing safe and trustworthy AI for AD using XAI techniques. The proposed SafeX framework enables integrating diverse XAI methods with AD systems to ensure safety while providing transparency.
