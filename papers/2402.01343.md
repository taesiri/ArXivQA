# [Shapelet-based Model-agnostic Counterfactual Local Explanations for Time   Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the lack of explainable AI (XAI) methods for time series data. Specifically, it focuses on providing counterfactual explanations for time series classification tasks. Counterfactuals highlight the differences between the original instance and a generated counterfactual instance that flips the prediction to a different class. Such explanations can help build trust in ML models and provide insights to researchers. However, existing counterfactual methods for time series have limitations in metrics like closeness, sensibility, plausibility, and sparsity.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Time-CF, a model-agnostic counterfactual explanation method for time series classification. It utilizes shapelets (discriminative subsequences) and TimeGAN (a GAN for time series) to generate counterfactual instances. 

The key steps are:
1) Extract shapelet candidates that are discriminative of classes
2) Train a TimeGAN on data from classes other than the instance's original class 
3) Generate fake sequences from the TimeGAN
4) Replace the original shapelet in the instance with a fake shapelet
5) Check if the prediction flips - if so, add as counterfactual

Main Contributions:
- Introduces Time-CF, a new method to generate counterfactual explanations for any time series classifier using shapelets and TimeGAN
- Enables instance-level explanations highlighting discriminative subsequences for time series classification 
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on closeness, sensibility, plausibility and sparsity compared to existing methods
- Showcases the ability to provide explanations for CNN, DrCIF, RF, and KNN classifiers on real-world UCR time series datasets
- Provides a model-agnostic approach that can explain predictions of any black-box time series classifier

The paper makes key contributions in advancing counterfactual explanations for time series data to be more realistic and useful for practitioners.
