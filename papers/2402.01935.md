# [Code Representation Learning At Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01935)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Recent large code language models have shown promising results on downstream code generation tasks using very limited pretraining corpora compared to large natural language models. However, code representation learning lags behind in leveraging large corpora to develop general-purpose programming language embedding models. 

- The standard masking strategy from BERT of randomly replacing 80% tokens with [MASK], 10% with random tokens and keeping 10% unchanged leads to deteriorated representations for code as it can alter semantics and structure.

Methodology:
- Propose CodeSage, a bidirectional Transformer encoder trained with two-stage pretraining on a vast corpus of 237M code files and 75M text-code pairs across 9 languages.

- Stage 1: Jointly train on identifier deobfuscation (DOBF) to predict masked identifier names and a customized masking strategy without replacing tokens to retain structure. DOBF encodes semantics and structure while the masking strategy learns beyond just identifiers.

- Stage 2: Further enhance representations via bimodal contrastive learning on constructed hard positives (text snippets, function body pairs with signatures/return statements removed) and hard negatives (close yet incorrect examples in embedding space).

Main Contributions:
- Developed effective token-level denoising scheme retaining structure for pretraining code models at scale. DOBF and no-replacement masking complement each other.

- Demonstrated the importance of constructing hard positives and hard negatives for contrastive learning. Removing shortcuts in text-code pairs and approximating hard negatives boosts performance.  

- Established SoTA off-the-shelf models across variety of downstream tasks through two-stage pretraining fueled by vast corpora. Detailed analysis provided on factors contributing to representation learning.

- Released CodeSage models to facilitate future research on leveraging large corpora for programming languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents CodeSage, a cutting-edge pre-trained code representation model fueled by vast amounts of code data and trained using a two-stage scheme with masking language modeling, identifier deobfuscation, and bimodal contrastive learning that substantially outperforms previous models on a variety of downstream code intelligence tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents CodeSage, a large-scale pre-trained code representation model. The main contributions are:

1) Proposes a two-stage pre-training scheme: first with a mix of masked language modeling and identifier deobfuscation objectives, then with bimodal contrastive learning using constructed hard positives and hard negatives.

2) Trains CodeSage models with 130M, 356M, and 1.3B parameters on a huge dataset of 237 million code files and 75 million code-text pairs across 9 languages. 

3) Shows that CodeSage outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by significant margins on a variety of downstream tasks including code search, code classification, etc.

4) Provides detailed ablation studies and analysis to understand the factors contributing to effective code representation learning, including the impact of masking strategies, hard positives/negatives, contrastive learning objectives, etc.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing methods and training huge models to advance the state-of-the-art in general-purpose code representation learning. The comprehensive evaluation and analysis also provide useful insights.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Code representation learning
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Masked language modeling (MLM) 
- Identifier deobfuscation (DOBF)
- Contrastive learning (CL)
- Hard positives and negatives
- Bimodal contrastive learning 
- Zero-shot evaluation
- Code search
- Code classification

The paper proposes a two-stage pretraining scheme called CodeSage for learning code representations. The key ideas include using a mix of MLM and DOBF in stage 1, and bimodal contrastive learning with constructed hard positives and negatives in stage 2. The method is evaluated on downstream tasks like code search and classification in a zero-shot setting and shows significant gains over previous models.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around self-supervised pretraining objectives for code, contrastive learning, model scaling laws, and zero-shot transfer performance on code intelligence tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage pre-training scheme. What is the motivation behind using a two-stage approach instead of a single-stage approach? How do the two stages complement each other?

2. Identifier deobfuscation (DOBF) is used in the first pre-training stage. Why is DOBF more suitable for encoding semantic and structural information in code compared to standard masked language modeling? 

3. The paper finds that the standard 80-10-10 masking strategy used in BERT leads to worse performance on downstream tasks for code. Why does this corruption strategy not work as well for code as it does for natural language?

4. Hard negatives are constructed in an unsupervised manner during contrastive learning. What approximation method is used for identifying hard negatives? Why is this a reasonable approximation?

5. The paper uses bimodal contrastive learning with (text, code) pairs instead of unimodal contrastive learning. What are the limitations of using dropout-based augmentation that make bimodal contrastive learning more suitable?

6. What modifications are made to the (text, code) pairs during hard positive construction to prevent the model from learning shortcuts? Why do these modifications help?

7. Contrastive learning leads to larger improvements on cross-lingual search tasks. What intrinsic properties of bimodal contrastive learning account for this?

8. Pre-training objectives impact how downstream performance scales with model size. How does the scaling trend differ between token-level pre-training only and contrastive learning only? What inferences can be made?

9. What custom token-level denoising schemes are proposed in this paper? How do they capture semantics and structure in code better than standard MLM?

10. The method uses vast amounts of pre-training data. What techniques like concatenation and block attention are used to handle long code snippets during pre-training?
