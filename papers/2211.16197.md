# [FJMP: Factorized Joint Multi-Agent Motion Prediction over Learned   Directed Acyclic Interaction Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16197)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we efficiently generate accurate and scene-consistent joint future trajectory predictions for multi-agent driving scenarios with many interacting agents? 

The key hypothesis is that factorizing the joint prediction task into a sequence of marginal and conditional predictions according to the partial ordering of a learned directed acyclic interaction graph will lead to more accurate and consistent joint predictions compared to non-factorized approaches that make simultaneous joint predictions. The paper proposes a novel framework called FJMP that decomposes the joint prediction task in this factorized manner over learned sparse interaction graphs, which enables scalable joint prediction for scenarios with many agents. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed factorized prediction approach leads to improved accuracy and scene consistency compared to non-factorized baselines, especially for the most interactive agents in the scenes. The results support the hypothesis, showing clear improvements on the joint prediction metrics with the proposed factorized design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing FJMP, a novel joint motion prediction framework that efficiently generates factorized joint trajectory predictions over sparse directed acyclic interaction graphs. The key ideas include:

- Modeling the future scene interaction dynamics as a sparse directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges denote influencer-reactor relationships between agents. 

- Decomposing the joint prediction task into a sequence of marginal and conditional predictions according to the partial ordering of the DAG. This factorization induces an inductive bias that eases the complexity of learning the joint distribution.

- Employing a lightweight directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN) architecture to efficiently process predicted future information through the DAG and decode the marginal and conditional predictions. 

- Demonstrating that FJMP produces more accurate and scene-consistent joint predictions than non-factorized approaches on the INTERACTION and Argoverse 2 datasets, especially on the most interactive agents. FJMP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION benchmark.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel framework, FJMP, for efficient and accurate factorized joint motion prediction that scales to scenes with many interacting agents by exploiting the structure in future interactions. The key innovation is the joint factorization over learned sparse directed acyclic graphs.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel approach for multi-agent motion prediction in driving scenarios. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:

- Most prior work focuses on marginal trajectory prediction, where the future trajectory of each agent is predicted independently. This paper tackles the more challenging problem of joint trajectory prediction, where the goal is to predict a consistent set of futures for all agents. 

- Many recent joint prediction methods generate simultaneous predictions for all agents at once. A key contribution of this paper is factorizing the joint prediction problem into a sequence of marginal and conditional predictions over a learned interaction graph. This allows the method to scale efficiently to scenes with many agents.

- The proposed factorization approach is related to recent two-agent joint prediction methods like M2I and ConPr. However, those methods only handle joint prediction between two interacting agents. This paper generalizes the factorization to arbitrary numbers of interacting agents through the use of directed acyclic graphs.

- Most prior interaction modeling focuses only on past interactions observed in the input histories. A novelty of this work is the learned interaction graph models future interactions that may occur between agents.

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging INTERACTION benchmark while retaining efficiency advantages over transformer-based approaches.

Overall, this paper makes multiple innovations over prior work to enable accurate, consistent and efficient joint motion prediction at scale. The factorization over learned interaction graphs is a particularly novel contribution for multi-agent modeling. This looks like an important advancement in the field of motion forecasting for autonomous driving.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Further refinement of the interaction graph predictor to improve performance. The results indicate that using the ground-truth interaction graphs leads to better performance compared to using the learned interaction graphs. The authors suggest improving the interaction graph predictor may yield additional gains.

- Exploring mechanisms to prune the interaction graph to best trade off performance and efficiency. The paper notes that long chains of leader-follower behavior may require costly sequential processing. Finding ways to simplify the graph while retaining key interactions could improve efficiency.

- Extending the framework to handle additional agent types beyond vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. The experiments focused on vehicle prediction, but expanding to more diverse agents could be useful.

- Incorporating uncertainty estimates into the predictions. The paper generates multiple modalities but does not currently model uncertainty. Adding probabilistic predictions could be beneficial.

- Improving reasoning about influencer-reactor dynamics during training. The ablation study shows the importance of techniques like teacher forcing, suggesting room for better ways to learn these relationships.

- Evaluating the approach on additional datasets and tasks beyond motion prediction. Testing the generalizability of the factorized modeling approach to new domains could be interesting.

- Exploring the integration of the framework into downstream autonomous driving systems and evaluating the end-to-end impact. Assessing performance gains in actual planning and decision making is an important direction.

In summary, key suggestions include improving the interaction modeling, trading off performance and efficiency, expanding agent types, adding uncertainty, better learning of dynamics, evaluating generalizability, and testing integration into full systems. The proposed factorized modeling approach seems promising but still has room for extension and validation in new settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes FJMP, a novel framework for joint motion prediction of multiple agents in driving scenarios. FJMP models future interactions between agents as a sparse directed acyclic graph (DAG) and factorizes the joint prediction problem into a sequence of marginal and conditional predictions according to the DAG structure. Specifically, marginal predictions are generated for source nodes, and conditional predictions that depend on parent node predictions are generated for non-source nodes. The predictions are decoded using an adapted directed acyclic graph neural network architecture. FJMP is evaluated on the INTERACTION and Argoverse 2 datasets and shown to produce more accurate and scene-consistent joint predictions compared to non-factorized approaches, especially for highly interactive agents. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION benchmark and ranks 1st on the leaderboard. Key benefits of FJMP are its ability to explicitly model interactions for joint prediction through the learned DAG structure and its scalability to scenes with many agents.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes FJMP, a novel framework for joint motion prediction of multiple agents in driving scenarios. FJMP models the future interaction dynamics between agents as a sparse directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges indicate influencer-reactor relationships. It then decomposes the joint prediction task into marginal predictions for source nodes in the DAG, followed by conditional predictions for non-source nodes based on the predicted futures of their parent nodes. This allows FJMP to efficiently generate diverse joint futures for scenes with many agents. 

FJMP consists of three main components: (1) a LaneGCN-based feature encoder to process agent histories and map context; (2) an interaction graph predictor to construct the DAG; and (3) a DAG-based trajectory decoder to produce factorized joint predictions. Experiments on the INTERACTION and Argoverse 2 datasets show FJMP generates more accurate and scene-consistent predictions than non-factorized baselines. It performs particularly well on complex interactive cases and achieves state-of-the-art results on the INTERACTION benchmark. Key benefits are the ability to model sparse interactions between many agents and the efficiency of the factorized prediction scheme. Limitations include reliance on heuristic interaction labels and computational costs for long chains of interactions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel joint motion prediction framework called FJMP for generating accurate and scene-consistent trajectory predictions for multiple interacting agents in driving scenarios. 

The key idea is to model the future interaction dynamics between agents as a sparse directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges represent influencer-reactor relationships. The joint prediction task is then factorized into a sequence of marginal predictions for source nodes and conditional predictions for non-source nodes based on the DAG structure. 

Specifically, they first learn to predict a sparse interaction graph between agents using attention and graph networks. Cycles are removed to convert it into a DAG. Then a DAG neural network architecture is used to do sequential decoding - marginal prediction for source nodes, followed by conditional prediction for non-source nodes based on parent node predictions. This allows joint futures to be efficiently generated for scenes with many agents.

The method is evaluated on the INTERACTION and Argoverse datasets. Results show it produces more accurate and scene-consistent joint predictions compared to non-factorized approaches, especially for highly interactive agents. It achieves state-of-the-art on the INTERACTION benchmark.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of predicting the future motion of multiple interacting agents in driving scenarios. Specifically, it focuses on generating a set of joint future trajectory predictions, where each predicted future consists of a trajectory for each agent and the trajectories are consistent with each other. 

The key questions/challenges the paper aims to address are:

- How to efficiently model interactions between agents and reason about them to make accurate and consistent joint predictions, especially in scenes with many interacting agents where the joint prediction space grows exponentially.

6. How does the sequential decoding process impact the diversity of the predicted joint futures? Does decoding in topological order constrain the diversity?

7. The paper uses a heuristic to identify the "challenging" interactive cases for evaluation. What impact does this heuristic have on the reported performance, and could a learned complexity measure be beneficial?

8. How does the performance of joint prediction degrade as the maximum number of agents in a scene increases? Is there a bottleneck on scaling to very dense, interactive traffic?
