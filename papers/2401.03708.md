# [Data assimilation and parameter identification for water waves using the   nonlinear Schrödinger equation and physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In ocean engineering research, measuring deep water wave elevations using in-situ sensors yields spatially sparse data due to limited number of deployed gauges. This makes it challenging to reconstruct the full spatio-temporal extent of the wave surface elevation.

- Conventional numerical techniques face difficulties in solving this ill-posed inverse problem of reconstructing the wave field from sparse measurements. They are also computationally expensive for such inverse problems.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to assimilate boundary data from two measurement locations several meters apart and reconstruct the wave field in between. 

- The PINN incorporates the hydrodynamic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) in its loss function to ensure physical consistency of reconstructions.

- Two hypotheses are examined: (1) PINN can reduce required wave gauges by assimilating data to reconstruct surfaces in between (2) Learning optimized NLSE coefficients in PINN enhances reconstruction compared to using predetermined, constant coefficients.

Methodology:
- Synthetic irregular wave elevation time series data is generated using high-order spectral method at 4 gauge locations in a numerical wave tank. Data from 2 locations is used for assimilation.  

- A PINN is developed with NLSE residuals in its loss function to reconstruct envelopes between provided boundaries. NLSE coefficients are initially kept constant.

- In the second phase, the peak frequency and wavenumber are made trainable variables allowing identification of optimal NLSE coefficients.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates gauge reduction by assimilating data from only 2 locations to reconstruct envelopes at all 4 locations with reasonable accuracy.

- Identifying optimized NLSE coefficients as opposed to using predetermined constant values further enhances reconstruction quality.

- Provides a practical showcase of using PINN for a technically relevant application in ocean engineering.

- Sets the ground for more flexible nonlinear data-driven water wave modeling by integrating observations with established theoretical model equations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using physics-informed neural networks to assimilate sparse wave elevation measurements for reconstructing envelopes and identifying optimal coefficients in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation that describes gravity water waves.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development and demonstration of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for reconstructing water wave envelopes in a wave tank using the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). Specifically, the paper shows two key applications:

1) Using the PINN for data assimilation to reconstruct the wave envelope between two measurement locations based only on boundary data. This allows reducing the number of costly wave gauges. 

2) Identifying optimized NLSE coefficients as part of the PINN training to enhance the reconstruction quality compared to using predetermined, constant coefficients. This addresses an inverse problem.

Through testing on over 600 irregular wave samples, the paper shows the feasibility of using PINNs for these applications related to wave reconstruction and parameter identification. The method is able to reduce errors by 8.82% on average by incorporating trainable NLSE coefficients. Overall, the paper demonstrates relevant and practical use cases of PINNs in the field of ocean engineering and water wave research.

The paper focuses on using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to assimilate sparse wave elevation measurements in order to reconstruct the full wave surface envelope and identify optimal model parameters. Key aspects explored are using the hydrodynamic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) in the PINN loss function for physical consistency, treating this as an ill-posed inverse problem, and addressing potential model misspecification between the NLSE and more complex wave models used to generate synthetic data. Overall, the core focus is leveraging PINNs for data assimilation, parameter identification, and surface reconstruction in the context of deep water ocean waves.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions practical challenges in reconstructing wave surfaces from real-world radar data. What are some of the key issues and how might the proposed PINN framework help to resolve them?

3. The paper demonstrates gauge reduction through data assimilation between two measurement points. How could the feasibility and robustness of this approach be further tested, for example by varying gauge positions or increasing spatial gaps?  

4. What impact would using directional wave data in two dimensions have on the proposed PINN framework and what modifications would be required?

5. The paper identifies optimized NLSE coefficients through making ωp and kp trainable variables. Could more coefficients be identified and would increasing complexity reduce robustness?

7. The paper uses synthetic irregular wave data from numerical simulations. How would real physical measurements impact results and what data pre-processing steps might be required?

8. Envelope offsets are observed using predetermined coefficients. What is the root cause of this issue and are there alternative approaches besides trainable coefficients to address it?

9. How does the choice of PINN loss function impact how well physics is enforced versus fitting to measurement data? Could additional regularization be beneficial?

10. The paper demonstrates coefficient identification for a slightly misspecified model. What are broader implications when using PINN for problems with higher model discrepancy and how can accuracy versus robustness be balanced?
