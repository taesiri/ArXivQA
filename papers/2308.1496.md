# [Target-point Attention Transformer: A novel trajectory predict network   for end-to-end autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1496)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively leverage perceptual features from sensors like cameras and LiDAR for end-to-end autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction, in order to improve driving performance and reduce accidents?The key hypothesis appears to be that using Transformer's attention mechanism to directly interact with high-dimensional perception features will enable smoother, more accurate trajectory predictions compared to existing methods like conditional imitation learning (CIL) or GRU-based networks. The limitations of CIL (needing multiple networks for different maneuvers) and GRU approaches (losing important perceptual information during feature compression) motivate exploring Transformer architecture for this trajectory prediction task. The central goal is to develop a waypoint prediction network that makes better driving decisions by fully exploiting available sensor data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper proposes a novel Target-point Attention Transformer (TAT) network for trajectory prediction in end-to-end autonomous driving. This is the first work to apply Transformer architecture for trajectory prediction in end-to-end driving models. 2. The TAT network utilizes Transformer's attention mechanism to directly interact with high-dimensional perception features from the encoder, instead of compressing them like in previous GRU-based approaches. This allows the network to leverage more perceptual information for trajectory forecasting.3. The proposed TAT network significantly outperforms prior works like conditional imitation learning and GRU-based models on the CARLA driving simulator. Quantitative experiments show reductions in collisions and blocked vehicles, and improvements in route completion.4. The paper provides an ablation study analyzing different design choices like target-point attention, activation functions, and positional encodings. It concludes that the target-point attention and proper activation function are critical for good performance.5. Overall, the TAT network sets a new state-of-the-art for end-to-end driving models on the complex CARLA benchmark. The results demonstrate the potential of Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems.In summary, the key innovation is the design of the Target-point Attention Transformer to effectively leverage perceptual features for trajectory forecasting in end-to-end autonomous driving models. Both quantitative and qualitative results on CARLA highlight the advantages of this approach.
