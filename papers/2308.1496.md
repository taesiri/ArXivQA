# [Target-point Attention Transformer: A novel trajectory predict network   for end-to-end autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1496)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively leverage perceptual features from sensors like cameras and LiDAR for end-to-end autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction, in order to improve driving performance and reduce accidents?The key hypothesis appears to be that using Transformer's attention mechanism to directly interact with high-dimensional perception features will enable smoother, more accurate trajectory predictions compared to existing methods like conditional imitation learning (CIL) or GRU-based networks. The limitations of CIL (needing multiple networks for different maneuvers) and GRU approaches (losing important perceptual information during feature compression) motivate exploring Transformer architecture for this trajectory prediction task. The central goal is to develop a waypoint prediction network that makes better driving decisions by fully exploiting available sensor data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper proposes a novel Target-point Attention Transformer (TAT) network for trajectory prediction in end-to-end autonomous driving. This is the first work to apply Transformer architecture for trajectory prediction in end-to-end driving models. 2. The TAT network utilizes Transformer's attention mechanism to directly interact with high-dimensional perception features from the encoder, instead of compressing them like in previous GRU-based approaches. This allows the network to leverage more perceptual information for trajectory forecasting.3. The proposed TAT network significantly outperforms prior works like conditional imitation learning and GRU-based models on the CARLA driving simulator. Quantitative experiments show reductions in collisions and blocked vehicles, and improvements in route completion.4. The paper provides an ablation study analyzing different design choices like target-point attention, activation functions, and positional encodings. It concludes that the target-point attention and proper activation function are critical for good performance.5. Overall, the TAT network sets a new state-of-the-art for end-to-end driving models on the complex CARLA benchmark. The results demonstrate the potential of Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems.In summary, the key innovation is the design of the Target-point Attention Transformer to effectively leverage perceptual features for trajectory forecasting in end-to-end autonomous driving models. Both quantitative and qualitative results on CARLA highlight the advantages of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a novel Transformer-based trajectory prediction network called Target-point Attention Transformer (TAT) for end-to-end autonomous driving that utilizes attention mechanisms to interact directly with high-dimensional perception features and target points, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CARLA simulator by significantly reducing accidents and improving route completion compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of end-to-end autonomous driving:- This paper proposes a novel Transformer-based network architecture for predicting future waypoints/trajectories. Most prior work has relied on RNN/LSTM or CNN architectures. Using Transformer allows the model to better capture long-range dependencies and context.- The idea of using attention between predicted waypoints and target points is novel and helps the model learn to follow the navigation goals more accurately, especially at intersections. Prior work did not explicitly model this interaction.- Evaluating trajectory prediction methods for end-to-end driving in complex urban environments is still relatively new. Many prior papers only tested in simple scenarios or highway settings. The experiments here using the challenging CARLA benchmark push the state-of-the-art in terms of driving performance.- The comparison between auto-regressive and classification formulations for trajectory prediction is an interesting analysis. For end-to-end driving, they find classification works better, whereas auto-regression is often better for pedestrian trajectory forecasting.- The overall results achieved surpass prior published methods on the CARLA leaderboard, demonstrating this is a true advance to the state-of-the-art for this problem setting.- One limitation is that they rely on a pretrained perception model (TransFuser) rather than training the perception and prediction jointly end-to-end. Some recent work has looked at joint training.Overall, I think the proposed method and experiments demonstrate an important advancement in learning-based models for self-driving vehicles by effectively applying Transformer networks to the trajectory forecasting problem. The results show significant promise in handling complex urban driving scenarios.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Exploring better perception networks, especially explanatory networks such as those proposed in other recent works (e.g. Shao et al. 2022, Chitta et al. 2022, Chen et al. 2022). The authors note that their method struggled with traffic light recognition, likely due to limitations of the Transfuser perception model they used. They suggest investigating perceptual networks that can provide better traffic light detection.- Incorporating additional constraints into the trajectory planning, such as safety and efficiency requirements. The authors note that their trajectory-based approach can more easily incorporate constraints by adjusting the trajectory planning algorithm. - Further exploration of classification vs auto-regression for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. The authors found classification worked better than auto-regression in their experiments, contrasting with findings in pedestrian trajectory prediction. More research could elucidate when each approach is most suitable.- Ablation studies and architecture improvements for the Transformer-based decoder. The authors propose a novel decoder architecture but suggest there are likely further enhancements possible through ablation studies and architectural tweaks.- Testing the approach on more complex datasets and generalized driving scenarios. The authors currently only evaluate on the CARLA simulator with fixed weather conditions. Expanding the diversity of environments could reveal areas for improvement.In summary, the main future directions are: improving perception, adding constraints, understanding tradeoffs between classification and auto-regression, refining the Transformer decoder, and evaluation on more diverse and complex scenarios. The authors lay out promising paths for advancing their Transformer-based end-to-end driving approach.
