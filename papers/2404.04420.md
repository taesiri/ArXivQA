# [The NES Video-Music Database: A Dataset of Symbolic Video Game Music   Paired with Gameplay Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04420)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural models for music generation are popular, but there are no large datasets tailored for learning to generate video game music from gameplay data. This limits research on building systems to automatically generate appropriate background music for games.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel dataset called NES-VMDB containing 98,940 gameplay videos from 389 NES games, each paired with its original soundtrack in symbolic MIDI format.

- Build the dataset by collecting long-play YouTube videos for 389 NES games, slicing them into 15-second clips, extracting the audio from clips, and using audio fingerprinting to identify the corresponding MIDI piece from the existing NES-MDB dataset.

- Establish a baseline method using Controllable Music Transformer (CMT) conditioned on rhythmic features from gameplay clips to generate new NES music pieces.

Main Contributions:
- The NES-VMDB dataset linking gameplay videos to symbolic game music to enable future research on generating game music from visuals.

- A baseline CMT model that generates music more structurally coherent than unconditional generation, showing conditioning on gameplay video can improve quality.

- Analysis showing the baseline CMT model learns some correlation between gameplay video and music genre, but significant research opportunities exist to improve game music generation.

In summary, this paper introduced a novel large-scale dataset as well as a baseline method for the task of generating video game music conditioned on gameplay visuals. Both the dataset and analysis of the baseline generator open up new research avenues at the intersection of music, vision, and gaming.
