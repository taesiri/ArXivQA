# [Smaller Language Models are capable of selecting Instruction-Tuning   Training Data for Larger Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) on large datasets incurs high training costs. 
- Prior work has shown models tend to learn easier examples first before progressing to more difficult ones. Hard examples are important for good generalization.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a "learning percentage (LP)" metric to measure sample difficulty from the model's perspective. Samples with a high LP at epoch 1 are considered easy, while low LP indicates difficult samples.

- Show smaller LM models (1B to 13B parameters) can use this metric to effectively select challenging subsets of instruction tuning datasets. Models trained on just the hard subsets match or exceed the performance of models trained on full datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Learning percentage (LP) provides an effective automatic measure of sample difficulty from the model's viewpoint. 

- LP hardness transfers across model sizes. Smaller LMs can select effective hard subsets for larger LMs. The quality improves as the smaller LM size increases.

- Introduce a fast approximate LP metric with comparable performance. Demonstrate state-of-the-art models can be trained on very small (1-3%) subsets selected by smaller models and match models trained on full datasets.

In summary, the paper shows smaller LMs can select high-quality training subsets for larger LMs, enabling more efficient instruction tuning. The LP metric is shown to be an effective automatic hardness measure for this task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a learning percentage-based metric to enable smaller language models to effectively select challenging training data for larger models, achieving comparable or improved performance to training on full datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel training data selection method based on a learning percentage metric that measures the difficulty of samples from the model's perspective. The key findings are:

1) Language models ranging from 1B to 13B parameters can effectively self-select high-quality training data using the proposed learning percentage ($\mathcal{LP}$) metric, achieving comparable or better performance compared to training on the full dataset. 

2) The hardness of training data transfers across different sized models. A smaller 350M model can select challenging samples for a 13B model, resulting in an equally good or better instruction-tuned 13B model.

3) An optimized approximate version of the metric ($\mathcal{LP}_{app}$) is proposed which is faster and as effective as the original $\mathcal{LP}$ metric.

4) Analysis reveals the subsets selected using the $\mathcal{LP}$ metric contain longer, coherent responses deemed difficult for models, as well as some noisy samples needing further investigation.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling smaller models to automatically select high-quality training data for larger models, thereby improving efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Instruction tuning - The paper focuses on instruction tuning of language models, which involves fine-tuning them to follow instructions and generalize to new tasks. This is a core concept. 

- Training data selection - The paper proposes a new method for selecting high-quality and difficult training data for instruction tuning, rather than using the full dataset. This is a main contribution.

- Learning percentage - A new metric introduced to measure sample difficulty based on model learning in early epochs. Lower scores indicate more difficult samples.

- Transferability - The paper shows that difficulty ratings transfer across model sizes, allowing smaller models to select data for larger models. 

- Efficiency - A faster approximate learning percentage metric is introduced that matches or improves on the original metric.

- Scale analysis - Experiments show the approach works across various model sizes from 350M parameters up to 13B. Larger models need fewer difficult samples.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with efficiently selecting challenging training data for instruction tuning in a transferable way, using learning percentage as the metric. The approach scales across model sizes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a learning percentage ($\mathcal{LP}$) metric to measure sample difficulty from the model's perspective. How is this metric mathematically defined? Explain how it captures the intuition that samples learned more in early epochs are easier. 

2. The paper shows $\mathcal{LP}(1)$-selected data leads to strong performance across varying model sizes. What is the underlying hypothesis behind why training on challenging samples alone is adequate? Discuss the theoretical basis that motivates this finding.

3. The paper finds the minimum data needed for larger models is lower when selected by $\mathcal{LP}(1)$. What factors contribute to this downward trend? Elaborate on why this relationship between model scale and required difficult data exists.  

4. Smaller models effectively select difficult samples for larger models based on $\mathcal{LP}(1)$. Explain why this transferability manifests and improves with smaller model size. Discuss the thresholds observed where transferability plateaus.

5. An approximate metric $\mathcal{LP}_{app}$ is proposed. Contrast the computation of $\mathcal{LP}_{app}$ and $\mathcal{LP}$ and explain how the approximation achieves faster performance. Elaborate on the basis for this approximation.

6. Analyze the challenging samples selected by $\mathcal{LP}(1)$ - what are their key characteristics? Why are longer, coherent responses considered more difficult? Discuss the underlying factors that contribute to sample difficulty.

7. The selected challenging subsets contain some noisy samples. Why might this be the case? What strategies could be adopted to alleviate this issue in data selection pipelines?

8. Compare the proposed self-selection strategy with other data selection techniques in the literature. What are the relative advantages and differences in computation or performance?

9. Discuss any limitations of the proposed method. What edge cases might it not account for and how can the robustness be improved? Suggest enhancements to handle diversity or mitigate selection biases.

10. Analyze the human evaluation conducted - explain the interface, methodology and discuss whether the results support the paper's claims. Suggest any improvements to the evaluation protocol.
