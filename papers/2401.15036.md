# [Distributed Simultaneous Localisation and Auto-Calibration using   Gaussian Belief Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate localization and coordination between robots in multi-robot systems requires precise extrinsic calibration between sensors and markers. However, manual calibration is impractical at scale. This paper tackles the problem of simultaneous localization and automatic extrinsic calibration of sensors and markers in a distributed multi-robot system. 

Methodology: 
The authors build on their prior work, Robot Web, which performs distributed localization using Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) on factor graphs. They extend this to optimize not only the poses of the robots, but also the extrinsic calibration parameters between the robot base frame, the sensor frame, and the marker frame. Each robot maintains its own factor graph and calibration parameters. Factors encode constraints such as odometry, inter-robot measurements, and calibration error. To reduce communication, the inter-robot factors only depend on the sensor and marker poses in the global frame rather than the calibration parameters. An adaptive regularization method assists with convergence.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation for simultaneous localization and extrinsic auto-calibration in multi-robot systems using distributed GBP
- Inter-robot factor formulation that spares communication effort by not sharing calibration variables 
- Adaptive regularization for GBP to improve convergence
- Demonstration of high accuracy close to centralized methods
- Analysis of robustness to communication failure, outliers, and limited communication range

The method is evaluated extensively in simulation and shows comparable performance to centralized methods. It also demonstrates robustness to challenging conditions like 80% message dropout, 40% outliers, and limited 10m communication range. Additional real-world experiments provide further validation.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to solve an important problem in multi-robot systems - co-localization with automatic extrinsic calibration. The distributed and asynchronous nature enhances scalability and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces an adaptive regularization term to assist with convergence of Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP). What is the intuition behind starting with a high regularization weight and decreasing it as optimization progresses? How does this differ from standard techniques like Levenberg-Marquardt?

2. Inter-robot communication is reduced by reformulating the calibration factor. What are the tradeoffs introduced by having separate sensor and marker pose variables instead of compounding transformations? Does this increase storage costs? 

3. What changes would need to be made to handle full 6DOF measurements instead of just range and bearing? Would the Lie group messages need to be adapted? Would the calibration factors change?

4. Robust kernels like DCS are used to handle outliers. How does the choice of kernel parameters affect accuracy and convergence rate? Is there a principled way to set these?

5. The sliding window formulation aggregates past measurements while limiting complexity. What are the tradeoffs in choosing the window size? How does this interact with the incremental nature of adding new factors?

6. What guarantees exist on the solution quality for loopy Gaussian belief propagation? How does the distributed asynchronous nature impact accuracy and convergence? 

7. The calibration method requires known data association between sensor and marker measurements. What changes would enable handling unknown data associations?

8. How does communication range limitation interact with incremental optimization? Do newer measurements fail to propagate across the network without rendezvous events?

9. What changes are needed to make the system lifelong, continuously refining calibration and poses over long durations? How can factor pruning be handled?

10. The method relies on onboard sensor and motion information only. What benefits exist in incorporating external measurements like GPS or known landmarks? How would these be represented?
