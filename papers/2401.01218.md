# [Zero-Shot Position Debiasing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 tend to exhibit position bias, where they overly rely on information at the beginning/end of the input context. This leads to poor performance when relevant information is in the middle of the context.

- Existing debiasing methods require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is impractical.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Zero-Shot Position Debiasing (ZOE) framework to mitigate position bias without any external knowledge or datasets. 

- ZOE leverages the low position bias in responses from a pre-trained LLM to guide the fine-tuning. It first collects unsupervised low-bias responses using diverse prompting strategies.

- A Master-Slave Alignment module then prunes low-quality responses to prevent undermining performance on non-biased samples. 

- Finally, a multi-objective optimization module fine-tunes the LLM using both original responses and aligned unsupervised responses.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a zero-shot debiasing framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs, without needing any external knowledge or non-biased datasets.

- Introduces a Master-Slave Alignment module to prune low-quality unsupervised responses before fine-tuning.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating multiple types of position bias on 8 datasets across 5 NLP tasks, outperforming existing debiasing methods.

- Shows only a small drop in performance on biased samples while significantly improving performance on non-biased samples.

In summary, the paper provides an effective and general framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs in a zero-shot manner, with strong empirical results across diverse tasks. The main novelty is leveraging responses from a pre-trained LLM itself to guide the fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a zero-shot debiasing framework called ZOE to mitigate position bias in large language models by leveraging unsupervised responses from pre-trained models and aligning them with target responses for multi-objective optimization during fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a zero-shot debiasing framework called ZOE (Zero-shot position debiasing) to mitigate position bias for large language models (LLMs). The framework does not require any external knowledge or non-biased datasets.

2. It introduces a master-slave alignment (MSA) module to prune low-quality unsupervised responses generated by pre-trained LLMs before using them to fine-tune the target LLM. This helps improve the quality of the unsupervised responses. 

3. It proposes a multi-objective optimization method to fine-tune the LLM using both the original biased dataset (master objective) and the aligned unsupervised responses (slave objective). This allows debiasing while retaining performance on the original biased dataset.

4. Experiments on eight datasets across five tasks (question answering, question generation, summarization, knowledge-grounded conversation, natural language inference) demonstrate that ZOE consistently outperforms existing debiasing methods in mitigating various types of position biases. It achieves this with minimal sacrifice in performance on biased samples.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective zero-shot debiasing framework for mitigating position bias in LLMs, which does not require any external knowledge or datasets. The introduction of the MSA module and multi-objective fine-tuning are also important contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Position bias - The paper focuses on mitigating position bias in large language models, which is the phenomenon where models leverage cues based on the position of information in the input.

- Zero-shot debiasing - The proposed framework aims to mitigate position bias without requiring any external bias knowledge or non-biased samples, making it a zero-shot debiasing approach. 

- Unsupervised responses - The framework uses unsupervised responses collected from a pre-trained language model as a slave objective for debiasing.

- Master-slave alignment (MSA) - An alignment module proposed to prune low-quality unsupervised responses before using them for debiasing. 

- Multi-objective optimization - The end model is fine-tuned using both the original labeled data and aligned unsupervised responses through multi-objective optimization.

- Generative language models - The paper focuses specifically on mitigating position bias in large, generative language models like T5 and GPT-3.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed zero-shot debiasing framework, the use of unsupervised data, and application to generative language models and position bias.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed ZOE framework leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing. Why are pre-trained LLMs chosen as the source for unsupervised responses? What properties make their responses suitable for debiasing fine-tuned models?

2. The master-slave alignment (MSA) module is used to prune low-quality unsupervised responses before fine-tuning. What types of unsupervised responses are identified as low-quality? Why is pruning important - how could low-quality responses undermine the debiasing performance?  

3. How exactly does the multi-objective optimization module work to fine-tune the LLM using both the original biased dataset and the aligned unsupervised responses? Explain the two loss functions and how they serve the main and slave objectives. 

4. ZOE does not require any external bias knowledge or non-biased datasets. How does it manage to debias without such information? What is the key intuition that enables zero-shot debiasing?

5. The paper evaluates ZOE on a diverse range of datasets and tasks. Which task does ZOE perform the best on in debiasing? Is there any task where the performance improvement is insignificant? If so, what could be the reason?

6. How do the results analyze the effect of using unsupervised responses from different sources and quality levels? What impact does response quality and source mismatch have on debiasing performance?  

7. The weighting hyperparameter α balances the main and slave optimization objectives. How does the ZOE performance vary for different α values? Is there an optimal value?

8. How robust is ZOE when the number of biased training samples is varied? Does ZOE consistently outperform fine-tuning baseline across different data sizes? What does this imply about ZOE's applicability in low-resource scenarios?

9. The paper focuses on mitigating three main types of position biases - lead bias, relative position bias and lexical bias. Does ZOE successfully mitigate all three bias types? Are there any noticeable differences in how effectively different bias types are alleviated? 

10. A limitation mentioned is that ZOE still relies on biased unsupervised responses. How can this be addressed in future work? Are there any promising ways to obtain fully unbiased responses for debiasing fine-tuned LLMs?
