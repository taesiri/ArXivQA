# [Neural Autoencoder-Based Structure-Preserving Model Order Reduction and   Control Design for High-Dimensional Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06256)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach to learn low-dimensional yet physically consistent approximations of high-dimensional mechanical systems like deformable objects and soft robots. The key idea is to leverage neural autoencoders to compress the system's configuration space into a latent representation, and then derive compressed Hamiltonian dynamics that govern the evolution of these latent states. Specifically, the autoencoder's decoder is combined with the original system specification to obtain compressed equivalents of terms like the inertia matrix and potential energy. This results in structurally similar latent dynamics that well approximate transient and steady state behaviors, with a relative error around 4% in tests on large mass-spring-damper networks. The latent dynamics are shown to properly reconstruct total energy evolutions. Based on this, the authors also introduce a model-based controller that successfully regulates the posture of heavily underactuated systems by operating in the learned latent space. Extensive simulations validate the approach, including assessments of the achievable compression rate, robustness to noise, and controllability. Key potential applications lie in model-based control for high-dimensional systems like soft robots and manipulation of deformable objects.
