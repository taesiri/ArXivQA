# [COLEP: Certifiably Robust Learning-Reasoning Conformal Prediction via   Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conformal prediction sets provide uncertainty quantification for model predictions, assuming data exchangeability. However, adversarial perturbations during inference violate this assumption and reduce the coverage guarantees.
- It is challenging for data-driven models alone to achieve high certified prediction coverage against such perturbations.

Proposed Solution - COLEP:  
- Proposes a certifiably robust conformal prediction framework called COLEP via probabilistic circuits.
- Comprises a learning component with main & knowledge models and a reasoning component with probabilistic circuits to encode logical relationships among models.
- Provides robustness analysis - derives certified prediction coverage under $\ell_2$ norm bounded perturbations. Also analyzes coverage considering finite calibration set size.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to integrate knowledge and reasoning for conformal prediction with formal coverage guarantees against perturbations.
- Establishes connection between model/knowledge utilities and reasoning component's effectiveness in correcting probabilities.
- Proves COLEP achieves higher certified coverage and accuracy than single model, given non-trivial model utilities.
- Empirically demonstrates improved coverage over baselines on GTSRB, CIFAR-10 and AwA2 datasets. Highlights validity of analysis via tight certified coverage.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel robust conformal prediction approach using probabilistic logical reasoning, with both theoretical and empirical evidence of benefits over standard data-driven techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a certifiably robust conformal prediction framework called COLEP that integrates logical reasoning capabilities via probabilistic circuits into deep neural networks and provides theoretical guarantees on improving prediction coverage against adversarial attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes COLEP, the first certifiably robust learning-reasoning conformal prediction framework via probabilistic circuits. The main contributions are:

1) It proposes a learning-reasoning pipeline that comprises a learning component with statistical models to learn concepts and a reasoning component with probabilistic circuits to encode knowledge rules and relationships among the concepts.

2) It provides theoretical analysis to derive end-to-end certified prediction coverage considering adversarial perturbations during inference. It also proves that COLEP achieves higher prediction coverage and accuracy than a single model. 

3) It conducts comprehensive experiments on image datasets to demonstrate the validity and tightness of the certified coverage bounds. Results show COLEP significantly improves the prediction coverage under adversarial attacks compared to baselines.

In summary, this is the first work to explore knowledge-enabled logical reasoning for conformal prediction and provides theoretical and empirical evidence that such a learning-reasoning framework can improve the robustness and reliability of uncertainty quantification. The certification framework as well as the architecture of integrating reasoning modules also shed light on future research of applying logical reasoning to trustworthy ML.

1. How does the proposed COLEP method formally integrate the learning and reasoning components? What are the key theoretical guarantees for combining probabilistic outputs from these two components?

2. What are the key advantages of using probabilistic circuits over alternative reasoning frameworks like Markov logic networks? How do properties like decomposability and smoothness contribute to more accurate reasoning under the COLEP framework?

3. The paper discusses encoding both preventive and permissive forms of knowledge rules. What is an example of each type of rule for a real-world application? How do they differ in terms of modeling causal relationships? 

4. Theorem 1 provides bounds on the conditional class probabilities after reasoning under bounded input perturbations. Walk through the key steps of the proof. What aspect of the reasoning component enables derive these robustness guarantees?

5. How does the paper quantify the utility of knowledge models and rules? What is the intuition behind definitions like $T_{j,\mathcal{D}}^{(r)}$, $Z_{j,\mathcal{D}}^{(r)}$, and $U_j^{(r)}$? 

6. What does Lemma 1 reveal about the effectiveness of the reasoning component? How do corrective factors $\epsilon_{j,0}$ and $\epsilon_{j,1}$ connect model utility to output calibration by COLEP?

7. Compare and contrast the certified prediction sets constructed in Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. What different assumptions hold in each case? How do they differ in terms of adversarial threat models?

8. Walk through the key ideas behind the proof of Theorem 4. When can we expect COLEP to outperform conformal prediction using only the main model in terms of coverage?

9. How does the lower bound on COLEP's prediction accuracy in Theorem 5 change with the number of knowledge rules and utility factors? What does this suggest about model design choices?

10. What are some limitations of the COLEP framework in terms of knowledge encoding, weighting, and inference? How might future work address some of these limitations?
