# [Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning   assisted Internet of Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In federated learning (FL) systems with a large number of participating clients (e.g. vehicles), the overhead for clients to maintain an "active state" with the server is very high. This refers to constantly updating status/resources to the server so they can be considered for selection.

- Prior FL research has ignored this overhead and focused only on model transmission overhead. But maintaining active state overhead is far larger with millions of clients.

Solution:
- Propose a distributed client selection framework where server does not collect client information or do selection. Clients self-evaluate using a fuzzy logic-based multi-objective evaluator.

- Evaluator considers sample quantity, available throughput, compute capability and loss function. Neighboring clients exchange evaluations via DSRC and select top ones as clients for that round.

Main Contributions:

- A distributed selection framework that eliminates the high overhead of maintaining active states with the central server. Evaluation and selection happens locally.

- A fuzzy logic based multi-objective evaluator that runs on each client and considers key metrics like data quantity/quality and system heterogeneity. 

- Extensive simulations show distributed selection achieves comparable performance to centralized approaches and significantly reduces communication overhead.

In summary, the key idea is to distribute the client evaluation and selection process with a customized fuzzy evaluator to avoid constant status updates to the server. This reduces overhead while maintaining accuracy. The decentralized approach is shown to work well through simulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a distributed client selection framework for federated learning in vehicular networks that eliminates the communication overhead of maintaining vehicle state information on the server by using fuzzy logic-based local multi-objective evaluation to select optimal clients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a distributed client selection framework for federated learning, where the server is not involved in client selection and does not gather information about all participating vehicles. This eliminates the communication overhead of maintaining active state for a large number of vehicles.

2. It proposes a multi-objective fuzzy evaluator that runs on each participating vehicle to assess its suitability to be selected as a client. The evaluator considers four variables - sample quantity, available throughput, computational capability, and loss function of local dataset.

3. It presents extensive simulations using a realistic vehicular network simulator integrated with OMNeT, simuLTE, SUMO and PyTorch. The results verify that the proposed distributed scheme approximates centralized client selection in terms of accuracy, while significantly reducing communication overhead.

In summary, the key contribution is the distributed client selection framework and fuzzy evaluator that aim to reduce communication overhead while maintaining accuracy compared to centralized approaches. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
