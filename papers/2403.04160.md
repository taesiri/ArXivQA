# [Improving Retrieval in Theme-specific Applications using a Corpus   Topical Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04160)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Document retrieval models based on pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great effectiveness. However, their performance is often limited in specialized, theme-specific applications such as academic paper search or product search. This is due to three main challenges: (1) specialized terminologies not seen in general text corpora, (2) queries from domain experts often omit obvious contexts, and (3) users have more specialized interests and search intents. Accumulating labeled data from these domains is also difficult.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework called ToTER (Topical Taxonomy Enhanced Retrieval) to improve retrieval in theme-specific applications by exploiting a corpus topical taxonomy. This taxonomy structures latent topics in the corpus into a tree, with each node representing a topic class. ToTER first links this taxonomy to individual documents by learning their relevance to each topic class. It then enhances existing PLM-based retrieval models via three strategies:

1) Search space adjustment to filter irrelevant documents based on topic overlap with the query. 
2) Class relevance matching to incorporate topical relatedness of queries and documents along with their semantic similarity.
3) Query enrichment to identify key topical phrases to fill in missing query contexts.

These strategies provide complementary signals to aid retrieval, especially when queries have limited contexts.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel framework ToTER to systematically incorporate corpus topical taxonomy to enhance PLM retrievers.
- Introduces effective strategies to utilize taxonomic knowledge for search space adjustment, complementing semantics, and query expansion.
- Evaluates ToTER over two real-world datasets, showing consistent and significant improvements without any labeled data.
- Shows ToTER has wide compatibility with diverse encoder models and also combines well with labeled data.
- Provides detailed analysis and ablation studies to highlight the utility of each component.

In summary, the paper presents a principled approach leveraging structured knowledge of corpus topics to address key challenges in specialized search scenarios. The proposed techniques demonstrate clear benefits in improving retrieval accuracy.
