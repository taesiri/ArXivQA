# [ACR: Attention Collaboration-based Regressor for Arbitrary Two-Hand   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to reconstruct 3D hand poses and shapes from a single RGB image in arbitrary scenarios, including interacting hands, truncated hands, and external occlusions. 

The key hypothesis is that by using center and part-based attention to disentangle representations between hands and hand parts, and incorporating cross-hand reasoning, the method can effectively reconstruct hands without being constrained to strictly interacting hand scenarios.

The main contributions are:

1) Taking the first step towards reconstructing hands in arbitrary scenarios rather than just interacting hands. 

2) Using center and part attention to mitigate interdependencies and release input constraints.

3) Introducing a cross-hand reasoning module to handle interacting hands while maintaining the ability to work on non-interacting hands.

4) Significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on interacting hand datasets while remaining comparable on single hand datasets.

5) Demonstrating qualitative results on challenging in-the-wild images and videos with occlusion, truncation etc.

In summary, the central research aim is arbitrary hand reconstruction by using representations that are robust to imperfect interactions and enable reasoning between hands when present. The key hypothesis is that disentangling and recombining global, local and cross-hand cues can achieve this effectively.
