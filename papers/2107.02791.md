# [Depth-supervised NeRF: Fewer Views and Faster Training for Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the question of how to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) more effectively when given limited input views. The central hypothesis is that by incorporating additional supervision from estimated 3D structure, NeRF can learn better scene geometry and appearance from fewer views. Specifically, the paper proposes using sparse 3D points from structure-from-motion as "free" supervision to guide the learning of the volume density in NeRF.The key ideas are:- Standard NeRF training from RGB images alone can lead to overfitting and incorrect geometry when given insufficient views.- Typical NeRF pipelines already estimate camera poses and sparse 3D points via structure-from-motion. These 3D points can provide "free" supervision.- The paper proposes a loss function that encourages the distribution over a ray's termination depth to match the estimated 3D point depth. This acts as a regularizer on the geometry.- This depth supervision allows NeRF to be trained faster (2-3x) and with fewer views while improving novel view synthesis quality.- The proposed depth loss can be incorporated into many other NeRF methods for improved performance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that sparse 3D structure provides a useful supervisory signal to guide NeRF geometry learning from limited views. The depth loss acts as a regularizer to prevent geometry failures.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can additional depth supervision improve neural radiance field (NeRF) training, particularly when given limited input views?The key hypothesis is that incorporating cheap and readily available depth cues (from structure-from-motion pipelines) as supervision during NeRF training will:1) Accelerate training by providing direct geometry cues rather than relying solely on view reconstruction. 2) Improve generalization and avoid overfitting, especially in the limited view regime, by encouraging the learned volume density to respect the surface geometry indicated by the sparse keypoints.Overall, the paper proposes that depth is a complementary supervisory signal to RGB that can guide NeRF to learn better scene representations from fewer views and enable faster training. The core contribution is a novel depth-supervised loss based on aligning ray termination distributions to keypoint depth priors.In summary, the paper aims to demonstrate that "free" sparse depth supervision from standard SfM pre-processing can meaningfully improve NeRF training and broaden its applicability to settings with limited input views. The central hypothesis is that depth provides useful geometric cues that are complementary to RGB supervision alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes Depth-supervised NeRF (DS-NeRF), a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by utilizing additional supervision from sparse 3D point clouds to improve the geometry modeling. The key ideas are:- Most NeRF pipelines already obtain sparse 3D points and their uncertainties as a by-product of structure-from-motion (SFM). This "free" sparse depth supervision can be incorporated into NeRF training via a loss that encourages the ray termination distribution to match the 3D point depth and uncertainty.- The depth supervision acts as a complementary signal to RGB supervision that anchors NeRF's geometry modeling, addressing common failure cases like overfitting with insufficient views. It encourages the density to have a unimodal impulse-like termination distribution at scene surfaces.- Experiments show DS-NeRF requires 2-3x less training time to reach the same performance as NeRF. It also enables high-quality novel view synthesis from only 2-3 input views, outperforming recent few-view NeRF techniques.- The depth supervision approach is compatible with many other NeRF variants, improving their performance when incorporated. It also works for other sources of depth like RGB-D fusion.In summary, the main contribution is a simple yet effective technique to inject sparse depth as supervision into NeRF training. This improves geometry modeling, enables better few-view performance, and accelerates training, all with negligible cost by re-using SFM outputs.

This paper presents Depth-supervised NeRF, a method to improve Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by incorporating depth supervision from sparse 3D keypoints estimated with structure-from-motion (SFM). Here are some comparisons to related work:- Most prior work on improving NeRF focuses on handling sparse input views or speeding up training.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring alternative forms of depth supervision besides sparse 3D keypoints from SfM. For example, the authors show preliminary experiments using depth from RGB-D sensors and dense 3D reconstruction methods. Integrating these other sources of depth data could further improve the performance and applicability of their approach.- Applying the depth supervision loss to other recent NeRF-based methods in addition to the ones explored in the paper. The depth loss seems compatible with many different NeRF frameworks, so investigating how it could benefit other variants is an interesting direction.- Adapting the approach to handle dynamic scenes, non-Lambertian effects, and other complex scene properties that violate the assumptions of standard NeRF. The depth supervision may help constrain the geometry even as the appearance model becomes more complex.- Developing techniques to transfer meta-learned priors and initializations across different NeRF datasets and domains. The paper shows this is challenging for existing methods, so new techniques to enable broader generalization would be useful.- Further analysis of the ray termination distribution and other modeled scene properties. The paper provides some analysis showing peaky unimodal distributions emerge in high quality NeRF models - more investigation into these properties could provide insight.- Improving run-time efficiency during inference by exploiting predicted depth maps. The paper focuses on training benefits, but utilizing predicted depths to guide sampling may also accelerate novel view synthesis.So in summary, the main future directions relate to expanding the approach to more complex scenes and NeRF variants, improving generalization and transfer learning, and further analysis of the ray termination behavior. Making depth supervision compatible with broader NeRF research seems like a key opportunity the paper highlights.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring other sources of depth supervision besides just sparse keypoints from SFM. For example, the paper shows preliminary experiments using dense depth maps from RGB-D reconstruction. The authors suggest this could be a promising direction to enable even better geometry modeling.- Applying the depth supervision idea to other types of implicit neural representations beyond just NeRF. The paper demonstrates it works well for standard NeRF as well as variants like PixelNeRF and IBRNet, but it could likely benefit other representations.- Improving the uncertainty modeling of the depth supervision. Currently uncertainty is captured just by the reprojection error of keypoints, but more complex probabilistic models could be explored.- Scaling up the approach to model larger and more complex scenes. The experiments focus on relatively small datasets of single objects or rooms. Applying it to massive outdoor scenes or full 3D environments could reveal new challenges.- Exploring how depth supervision could enable extending NeRF to settings like dynamic scenes, non-rigid deformation, and motion modeling. Some prior work has looked at these extensions, and depth cues could potentially help.In summary, the main future directions are around exploring new sources of depth data, applying the technique to other representations beyond NeRF, improving the uncertainty modeling, scaling to more complex scenes, and enabling new dynamic scene modeling applications. Overall the core idea of depth supervision seems promising to help address limitations around generalization and efficiency for implicit neural scene representations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields (DS-NeRF), a method to train radiance fields with additional supervision from estimated scene depth. Standard NeRF training requires input images with known camera poses, which are often obtained by running structure-from-motion (SFM) algorithms like COLMAP. The insight is that COLMAP also outputs sparse 3D point clouds that can provide "free" depth supervision for regularizing NeRF training, especially when given insufficient input views. Specifically, the proposed depth loss encourages the distribution over a ray's termination point to match the noisy depth distribution of the projected 3D keypoint, modeling uncertainty through reprojection error. Experiments show that depth supervision enables training higher quality NeRFs from fewer input views, while also accelerating optimization by 2-3x. Further, the proposed depth loss is readily incorporated into existing NeRF methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on standard datasets demonstrate DS-NeRF's effectiveness. The key idea is that sparse depth from SFM provides a simple yet impactful signal to improve NeRF training.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields (DS-NeRF), a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by incorporating supervision from estimated 3D point clouds and depth information. The key idea is that standard NeRF training from only RGB images can lead to incorrectly modeled scene geometry and overfitting when given insufficient input views. However, NeRF pipelines already use structure-from-motion (SFM) methods like COLMAP to obtain camera poses, which also outputs sparse 3D points. The paper shows that adding a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's termination depth to match these keypoints improves novel view synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that depth supervision enables training higher quality NeRFs from fewer input views 2-3x faster. The proposed loss is agnostic to the source of depth, so the paper also explores utilizing depth from scanned sensors. Overall, the depth supervision loss provides a simple plug-and-play module to improve existing NeRF methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields (DS-NeRF), a method to improve training of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by using additional depth supervision. NeRFs can struggle to learn correct geometry when trained on only a few input views, instead overfitting to the colors of the training views. The key idea is that the standard NeRF pipeline requires known camera poses, usually estimated with structure-from-motion (SFM) methods like COLMAP. COLMAP also provides sparse 3D point clouds that can provide depth supervision for each input view during NeRF training. Specifically, they derive a loss based on the KL divergence between the NeRF volume density and a Gaussian distribution centered on the 3D point with variance from COLMAP's reprojection error.Experiments demonstrate that adding this simple depth supervision loss results in much faster optimization and higher quality novel view synthesis from fewer input views. On the NeRF Real dataset, the depth-supervised NeRF trains 2-3x faster and achieves higher PSNR renderings from only 2 views compared to the original NeRF. The depth maps rendered are also significantly more accurate when evaluated against external ground truth depth. Qualitative results show the depth-supervised NeRF can still reconstruct good geometry even from only 2 input views where naive NeRF completely fails. Additionally, they show the depth supervision can be incorporated into other recent NeRF methods like PixelNeRF to improve their performance. The depth supervision has the flexibility to utilize other sources of depth like RGB-D reconstruction.In summary, this paper shows depth is a simple and highly effective supervisory signal for training neural radiance fields. By softly encouraging the implicit NeRF volume to respect sparse depth priors, rendering quality is vastly improved while requiring no additional data capture or annotation cost.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Depth-supervised NeRF (DS-NeRF), a method to improve Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by incorporating depth supervision. NeRF is a neural representation that encodes a scene as an implicit neural network mapping 3D coordinates to volume density and radiance. While NeRF can produce high-quality novel view synthesis, it often requires many input views and long training times. The key insight is that the NeRF volume rendering process lacks a strong prior on real world geometry - most scenes consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. The authors propose imposing an additional loss based on sparse 3D points obtained from structure-from-motion (SFM). The loss encourages the distribution over a ray's termination depth to match the noisy estimate of a sparse keypoint's depth. Experiments show that this simple idea leads to large improvements. DS-NeRF trains 2-3x faster, produces better renderings from fewer views, and can naturally incorporate other sources of depth like sensors. The method does not rely on category-specific priors, allowing it to generalize across scenes and be compatible with many NeRF extensions. Overall, the paper demonstrates depth as an inexpensive and effective supervisory signal to improve optimization and generalization of NeRFs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method proposed in this paper is a depth-supervised loss for training neural radiance fields (NeRFs). The key idea is to utilize additional supervision from sparse 3D point clouds that are automatically generated from structure-from-motion during the typical NeRF pre-processing pipeline. Specifically, the authors propose to enforce that the distribution over where a ray terminates matches the noisy depth estimate of a 3D keypoint projected onto the ray. This is implemented as a KL divergence loss between the rendered ray termination distribution and a Gaussian centered on the keypoint's depth with a variance given by its reprojection error. By incorporating this cheap supervisory signal that captures information about scene geometry, the authors are able to demonstrate faster training times and improved novel view synthesis, especially in limited view settings. The depth-supervised loss is shown to be compatible with various NeRF methods, as depth provides complementary information that reduces overfitting. Experiments validate that their approach enables rendering higher quality images given fewer input views on established datasets.

The paper presents Depth-supervised NeRF (DS-NeRF), a method to improve Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) using additional depth supervision. The key insight is that standard NeRF training requires known camera poses, which are typically estimated using structure-from-motion (SFM). SFM also produces a sparse 3D point cloud that can provide "free" depth supervision for NeRF training. Specifically, the authors propose adding a loss that encourages the distribution of depths along each ray to match the depth of the nearest 3D point. The depth uncertainty from SFM is modeled as a Gaussian distribution in the loss.By incorporating this simple depth-based loss, DS-NeRF is able to achieve higher quality novel view synthesis from fewer input views compared to vanilla NeRF. The depth supervision acts as a useful inductive bias that anchors the geometry learned by NeRF. Experiments show DS-NeRF trains 2-3x faster and produces better results from only 2-5 input views on datasets like NeRF Real and Redwood. The depth loss can also be incorporated into other NeRF methods to improve performance. Overall, the paper demonstrates depth as a cheap and effective supervisory signal for training NeRFs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

This paper is addressing the problem of fitting incorrect geometries when training neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with an insufficient number of input views. The key questions it seeks to address are:1. How can we improve NeRF to better reconstruct scene geometry when given limited training data? 2. Can we leverage other readily available signals beyond just RGB images to supervise the learning process?The paper proposes that using additional supervision from estimated scene depth can help address these issues. The depth can constrain the geometry learned by NeRF and prevent overfitting to the color information when views are limited. The paper shows that by incorporating a loss based on sparse depth obtained from structure-from-motion, they can train higher quality NeRFs from fewer input views.In summary, the core problems are improving geometry modeling and data efficiency for NeRFs. The paper explores sparse depth supervision as a way to provide complementary signals that can ameliorate these issues.
