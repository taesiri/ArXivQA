# [Open-Source Large Language Models Outperform Crowd Workers and Approach   ChatGPT in Text-Annotation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02179)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:How do open-source large language models (LLMs) such as HuggingChat and FLAN compare to proprietary models like ChatGPT and human annotations from MTurk in terms of performance on text annotation tasks?The key aspects that point to this question:- The paper introduces recent research showing impressive performance of ChatGPT on NLP tasks, but notes open-source LLMs are gaining attention for cost-effectiveness, transparency, reproducibility etc. - It states the goal is to assess these models using zero-shot and few-shot approaches on text annotation tasks, comparing their accuracy against MTurk and amongst themselves. - The results section evaluates the performance of ChatGPT, HuggingChat, FLAN and MTurk on 11 text annotation tasks across 4 datasets. - The conclusion summarizes that while ChatGPT had the best performance overall, open-source LLMs exceeded MTurk and demonstrated competitive potential against ChatGPT in certain tasks.So in summary, the central research question seems to be examining and comparing the performance of open-source LLMs versus ChatGPT and human annotations on text annotation tasks. The paper aims to assess the viability of open-source models as an alternative to proprietary LLMs and crowd-sourced human annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be comparing the performance of open-source large language models (LLMs) such as HuggingChat and FLAN to proprietary models like ChatGPT and human-based services like MTurk in text annotation tasks. The key findings are:- Open-source LLMs outperform MTurk crowd workers in the majority of text annotation tasks tested.- The top-performing open-source LLM models approach and even exceed ChatGPT's performance in certain tasks, demonstrating their competitive potential.- There is no single approach (e.g. temperature, model size, zero-shot vs few-shot) that consistently optimizes performance across models and tasks, highlighting the need for further research.- While ChatGPT still achieves the best performance overall, open-source LLMs represent a viable lower-cost alternative for many text annotation applications.In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of open-source LLMs as lower-cost, transparent, and customizable alternatives to proprietary models for text annotation, with performance approaching that of ChatGPT in various tasks. The comparison of different model settings and prompts also highlights areas for further optimization research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on skimming the paper, a one-sentence TL;DR could be:This study compares the performance of open-source Large Language Models like HuggingFace and Anthropic's FLAN to proprietary models like ChatGPT and human crowdworkers on text annotation tasks, finding that while ChatGPT achieves the best performance overall, the open-source models approach its accuracy in certain tasks and outperform crowdworkers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on a review of the paper, here are some key ways it compares to other research in the field:- Datasets: The paper utilizes four distinct datasets - tweets on content moderation from different time periods, tweets from US Congress members, and news articles. This provides a diverse range of text data which builds on and expands datasets used in prior work.- Tasks: The study implements 11 text annotation tasks spanning relevance classification, topic detection, stance detection, frame analysis, etc. The breadth of tasks allows for a comprehensive assessment of model capabilities across different text analysis problems.- Models Compared: The paper examines ChatGPT and two open-source models - HuggingFace and FLAN. It provides one of the first rigorous comparisons involving open-source LLMs, ChatGPT, and human annotators. Prior work has mostly focused just on ChatGPT or compared it with crowdsourcing.- Model Settings: The study explores different model sizes, temperature parameters, and zero-shot vs few-shot prompts. It goes beyond default model settings to elucidate the impact of these factors on performance. This provides insights into optimizing model use.- Evaluation approach: Accuracy is evaluated by agreement with trained annotators. The paper also computes inter-annotator agreement. This ensures credible ground truth and allows analysis of model consistency.Overall, the diverse datasets, comprehensive set of tasks, comparison of cutting-edge models, and rigorous evaluation approach allows this paper to build on previous research and provide significant new insights into the capabilities of LLMs for text annotation tasks. The findings help advance knowledge regarding the potential of open-source models as an alternative to commercial LLMs and crowdsourcing.
