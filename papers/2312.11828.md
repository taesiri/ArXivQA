# [TESS: A Multi-intent Parser for Conversational Multi-Agent Systems with   Decentralized Natural Language Understanding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11828)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Building chatbots and conversational assistants using a multi-agent system architecture improves extensibility and scalability. However, it complicates natural language understanding, especially for multi-intent utterances that invoke multiple agents. 
- Decentralized knowledge amongst agents makes it hard to evaluate which agents can handle a user query. Agents may also give poor evaluations on complex multi-intent queries that should be split.
- Traditional syntactic parsers face issues with decentralized parsing, as the correct parse depends on the specific agents present.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a 3-stage pipeline - (1) Generate a parse tree with all combinations using a syntactic parser, (2) Get broadcast scores by sending utterances to agents for evaluation, (3) Compute optimal parse tree traversal using a min-max backup scheme on node scores.
- This TESS parser handles decentralized knowledge and decentralized parsing challenges in multi-agent systems.

Key Contributions:
- Provide a specification for a parser tailored to multi-agent conversational systems that can handle complex multi-intent user queries. 
- Implement a computationally efficient parser called TESS that matches state-of-the-art deep learning approaches on multi-intent accuracy, while being much faster.
- Demonstrate TESS performance on multiple datasets, analyzing both parsing and intent classification accuracy. TESS edges out existing methods on metrics considering both.
- Show that TESS adds little overhead to single-intent classification performance, unlike other parsers that struggle on complex single-intent queries.

In summary, the paper addresses key parsing challenges that arise in decentralized multi-agent conversational systems and demonstrates an efficient solution without compromising accuracy.
