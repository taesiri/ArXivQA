# [Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14217)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can continuous diffusion models be applied to discrete text data to enable complex, controllable text generation?

The key points are:

- Diffusion models have shown great success for controllable generation in continuous domains like images and audio, but have not been applied to discrete text data. 

- Adapting diffusion models to text is challenging because text is discrete while diffusions are designed for continuous data.

- This paper proposes techniques to allow diffusion models to handle text, including learned embeddings to map text to a continuous space and improvements to the rounding process.

- The resulting diffusion language model, called Diffusion-LM, enables complex controllable generation capabilities like controlling syntactic structure and semantic content, which has been difficult with prior text generation methods.

- Experiments demonstrate Diffusion-LM's ability to perform fine-grained control tasks both individually and in composition, significantly outperforming prior plug-and-play text generation methods.

So in summary, the key research question is how to adapt continuous diffusion models to handle discrete text data in order to unlock new complex controllable generation capabilities. The proposed Diffusion-LM model provides a way to do this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing Diffusion-LM, a new language model based on continuous diffusion models, for controllable text generation. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing a continuous diffusion model adapted for discrete text data by adding learned embeddings and rounding techniques. This allows applying diffusion models developed for continuous data like images to the discrete text domain.

- Demonstrating a simple gradient-based algorithm for controllable text generation by steering the continuous latent variables of Diffusion-LM towards satisfying control constraints like target syntax trees or semantic content. 

- Evaluating Diffusion-LM on 6 challenging text generation control tasks ranging from attributes to complex structures. Diffusion-LM significantly outperforms prior plug-and-play methods based on autoregressive LMs and matches fine-tuning performance.

- Showing Diffusion-LM can achieve complex composed control objectives by simultaneously satisfying constraints on syntax and semantics. It also enables control tasks like infilling without needing specialized training.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Diffusion-LM to enable new forms of complex, fine-grained control for text generation by adapting continuous diffusion models to handle discrete text. The results demonstrate the advantages over prior autoregressive LM methods for controllable generation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new approach to controllable text generation using continuous diffusion language models, called Diffusion-LM. Here are some key ways this work compares to prior research in controllable text generation:

- Most prior work has focused on plug-and-play control methods applied to autoregressive language models like GPT-2 or GPT-3. This paper explores using a non-autoregressive diffusion model which provides more flexibility for complex structured control tasks.

- Existing plug-and-play methods like PPLM and FUDGE have shown successes primarily on simple attribute-level control tasks like controlling sentiment or topic. This paper demonstrates strong performance on more complex tasks like controlling syntax trees and semantic content.

- Diffusion models have become popular recently in vision and audio domains, but this work is one of the first to adapt them to discrete text. The authors propose techniques like learned embeddings and clamping to make diffusion models work effectively for language.

- Compared to other non-autoregressive language models like those for machine translation, this diffusion model approach does not require task-specific training and works generally for broad language modeling.

- The hierarchical continuous representations induced by the diffusion model appear to make complex structured control easier compared to discrete token-level models. This is a notable advantage over prior discrete diffusion LM approaches.

- While sample quality lags behind autoregressive LMs, this work shows Diffusion-LM enables stronger control, suggesting tradeoffs between fluency and controllability. With more work, the fluency gap could potentially be reduced.

Overall, this paper makes a compelling case for continuous diffusion LMs as a promising new approach to controllable text generation that can handle complex control tasks. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in controllable generation compared to prior plug-and-play methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Scaling up Diffusion-LM with more model capacity and compute. The authors mention their perplexity results are worse than autoregressive LMs, though this gap narrows when using larger models and datasets. They suggest further scaling could improve perplexity.

- Speeding up training and decoding of Diffusion-LM. The authors note decoding is slower than autoregressive LMs. Faster training and decoding would make Diffusion-LM more practical.

- Studying other model architectures besides Transformers. The authors use Transformer architecture, but suggest exploring other architectures like normalizing flows.

- Exploring other training techniques like discriminator training. The authors use a simple training loss, but mention exploring adversarial and contrastive losses.

- Applying Diffusion-LM to other modalities like images and audio. The authors focus on text but suggest extending the techniques to other data types.

- Exploring discrete diffusion modeling. The authors focus on continuous diffusion but suggest also looking at discrete state spaces.

- Studying controllable generation across multiple tasks. The authors demonstrate controllable generation on several tasks individually but suggest exploring controlling and composing over multiple tasks jointly.

- Developing additional control algorithms. The authors propose gradient-based control but suggest exploring other control algorithms like MCMC.

In summary, the main future directions are 1) scaling up models 2) faster training/decoding 3) new architectures 4) multi-task control 5) exploring discrete diffusions and 6) new control algorithms. The key next steps are developing larger and faster Diffusion-LMs with more sophisticated control capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new language model called Diffusion-LM based on continuous diffusion models. Diffusion models have been successful for image generation but adapting them to text is challenging due to the discrete nature of language. The key ideas are: 1) Defining an embedding function to map discrete text to continuous vectors. An end-to-end training objective is proposed to learn good embeddings. 2) A rounding method to map the continuous vectors back to discrete text. Both training and inference time techniques are proposed to facilitate rounding. 3) A method for controllable text generation by running gradient updates on the continuous latent variables of Diffusion-LM to balance fluency and satisfying control constraints specified by a classifier. Experiments demonstrate Diffusion-LM's improved performance on a diverse set of control tasks including syntactic structure, semantic content, and length constraints compared to prior plug-and-play methods. The hierarchical continuous latent variables enable complex fine-grained control not possible with discrete autoregressive language models.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Diffusion-LM, a new language model based on continuous diffusion models. The key innovation is adapting diffusion models, which have seen great success on continuous data like images, to the discrete nature of text.

The paper proposes Diffusion-LM, a new language model based on continuous diffusion models. Diffusion-LM starts with Gaussian noise vectors and incrementally denoises them into word vectors through a sequence of intermediate continuous latent variables. This hierarchical continuous latent space enables simple gradient-based algorithms to perform complex controllable text generation tasks such as constraining syntactic structure.
