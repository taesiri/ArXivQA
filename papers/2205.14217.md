# Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can continuous diffusion models be applied to discrete text data to enable complex, controllable text generation?The key points are:- Diffusion models have shown great success for controllable generation in continuous domains like images and audio, but have not been applied to discrete text data. - Adapting diffusion models to text is challenging because text is discrete while diffusions are designed for continuous data.- This paper proposes techniques to allow diffusion models to handle text, including learned embeddings to map text to a continuous space and improvements to the rounding process.- The resulting diffusion language model, called Diffusion-LM, enables complex controllable generation capabilities like controlling syntactic structure and semantic content, which has been difficult with prior text generation methods.- Experiments demonstrate Diffusion-LM's ability to perform fine-grained control tasks both individually and in composition, significantly outperforming prior plug-and-play text generation methods.So in summary, the key research question is how to adapt continuous diffusion models to handle discrete text data in order to unlock new complex controllable generation capabilities. The proposed Diffusion-LM model provides a way to do this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing Diffusion-LM, a new language model based on continuous diffusion models, for controllable text generation. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing a continuous diffusion model adapted for discrete text data by adding learned embeddings and rounding techniques. This allows applying diffusion models developed for continuous data like images to the discrete text domain.- Demonstrating a simple gradient-based algorithm for controllable text generation by steering the continuous latent variables of Diffusion-LM towards satisfying control constraints like target syntax trees or semantic content. - Evaluating Diffusion-LM on 6 challenging text generation control tasks ranging from attributes to complex structures. Diffusion-LM significantly outperforms prior plug-and-play methods based on autoregressive LMs and matches fine-tuning performance.- Showing Diffusion-LM can achieve complex composed control objectives by simultaneously satisfying constraints on syntax and semantics. It also enables control tasks like infilling without needing specialized training.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Diffusion-LM to enable new forms of complex, fine-grained control for text generation by adapting continuous diffusion models to handle discrete text. The results demonstrate the advantages over prior autoregressive LM methods for controllable generation.
