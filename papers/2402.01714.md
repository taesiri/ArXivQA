# [TrICy: Trigger-guided Data-to-text Generation with Intent aware   Attention-Copy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data-to-text (D2T) generation is an important task for natural language generation with applications like dialog systems. However, most approaches generate a single best text sequence from a data record. 
- In real-world applications, alternative sequences may be needed based on intent and user preferences. 
- Existing large language models are unsuitable for on-device deployment due to large size and high latency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes TrICy, a lightweight D2T generation framework that can generate text conditioned on intent information and optional user-provided trigger words. 
- It uses an encoder-decoder architecture with two encoders - one encodes intent and trigger, the other encodes input data record. 
- A copy mechanism is used to handle out-of-vocabulary entities like names, dates etc. accurately.
- Trigger words guide the model to generate more personalized and directed sequences. An algorithm is proposed to find optimal trigger usage ratio.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on E2E dataset with optimal trigger conditioning, outperforming prior approaches.
- Performs competitively on WebNLG dataset while having 60% fewer parameters than next best model.
- Controlled experiments demonstrate adaptive generation capabilities using intent and triggers.
- Qualitative analysis and user trials confirm usefulness in real applications like contextual recommendations.
- Tiny model footprint of 4.7 million parameters and low latency of 43ms makes TrICy suitable for on-device deployment.

In summary, the paper presents TrICy, a lightweight and flexible D2T framework to generate high-quality text adapting to intent and optional triggers, outperforming prior work while being feasible for edge devices. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and practical applicability.
