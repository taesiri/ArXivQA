# [Democratizing Reasoning Ability: Tailored Learning from Large Language   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13332)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we effectively distill the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller pre-trained language models to make such capabilities more accessible? 

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By establishing an interactive multi-round learning paradigm between the LLM teacher and smaller student LM, where the student provides feedback on its deficiencies which allows the teacher LLM to provide customized training data in return, the reasoning abilities of the smaller LM can be significantly improved.

In particular, the paper proposes:

1) A multi-round learning approach where the student LM exposes its weaknesses to the teacher LLM, allowing the teacher to provide tailored training data to target those deficiencies in the next round.

2) Incorporating self-reflection learning where the student LM also learns from its own mistakes.

3) Seamlessly integrating the multi-round paradigm with learning from the teacher LLM and the student's self-reflection to steadily improve reasoning ability.

Through experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks, the paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this interactive distillation process in transferring reasoning skills from large LLMs to smaller LMs. The goal is to make such capabilities more accessible and democratized.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a multi-round interactive learning paradigm between a student LM and a teacher LLM. In each round, the student provides feedback by exposing its deficiencies/mistakes, and the teacher provides customized training data tailored to the student's weaknesses. This enables mutual feedback and interaction.

2. Introducing a self-reflection learning approach where the student learns from its own mistakes through techniques like contrastive learning. This further exploits the reasoning potential of the student LM. 

3. Integrating the learning from teacher's customized feedback and student's self-reflection in a multi-round learning loop. This allows tailoring the training to the student's evolving status.

4. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in distilling reasoning abilities from large LMs to smaller LMs.

In summary, the key ideas are leveraging teacher-student interaction and student self-reflection to do tailored and customized training for distilling reasoning abilities from large LMs to smaller LMs through a multi-round learning paradigm. This contributes towards democratizing the reasoning abilities of large LMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading, a one-sentence summary of the key points in this paper could be: 

The paper proposes a tailored multi-round learning approach called RbyR that enables a smaller language model student to improve its reasoning ability by learning from both the feedback of a large language model teacher and reflection on its own mistakes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in learning reasoning skills in language models:

- The key idea of using a large language model (LLM) as a teacher to provide customized training data and feedback to a smaller student model is novel. Most prior work has focused on simply using the LLM to generate training data, without the interactive, multi-round learning paradigm proposed here. 

- The concept of self-reflection learning by having the student model learn from its own mistakes is also a new contribution not explored much before. This is analogous to how humans learn by reflecting on our own errors.

- The multi-round interactive learning process enables tailored and adaptive data generation based on the student's deficiencies. This level of customization for knowledge distillation is more advanced than prior one-shot distillation methods.

- Evaluating on both mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks allows for a more comprehensive assessment compared to prior work that often focuses on just one type of reasoning. The gains are shown across both reasoning domains.

- In terms of performance, this method achieves new state-of-the-art results compared to prior distillation techniques on most datasets, despite using a smaller 6B parameter student model.

- The feasibility study on smaller models down to 760M parameters also demonstrates the broader applicability of the approach for the wider community. Most prior work relies on larger 10B+ models.

In summary, the interactive learning framework, integration of self-reflection, and comprehensive evaluation demonstrate clear advances over related knowledge distillation methods for reasoning. The techniques proposed enable democratizing reasoning abilities in smaller, more accessible models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more interactions beyond the multi-round learning paradigm between the student LM and teacher LLM. The authors mention that without extensive engineering of the feedback prompt templates, there is room to further exploit the potential of the LLM as a reasoning teacher, such as through reinforcement learning.

- Investigating other forms of self-reflection learning beyond the simple triplet loss used in this work. The authors suggest ranking losses or having the model provide verbal critiques of its mistakes could further enhance the self-reflection ability. 

- Developing better evaluation criteria for judging the quality of generated rationales, beyond just using the final answer correctness. The authors suggest using evaluation models like GPT-4 or process-based rewards could help.

- Validating the approach on larger LMs beyond GPT-J, such as LLaMA models, to see if further gains are possible. The authors acknowledge limitations of the student model capacity.

- Conducting responsible and ethical collection of rationale data from proprietary LLM APIs, given concerns around copyright and ownership of LLM outputs. The authors call for discussion within research communities about proper data collection.

- Considering social impacts of democratizing LLM abilities, such as reasoning skills, and how they could be used for beneficial purposes like math education vs potential misuse.

In summary, the key directions are around improving the student-teacher interactions, enhancing the self-reflection learning, developing better rationale evaluation, scaling up the model sizes tested, and conducting research ethically. The authors provide a solid roadmap for advancing work on distilling reasoning skills from large LLMs to smaller models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a tailored learning approach to improve the reasoning ability of smaller language models by distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are: 1) A multi-round interactive learning paradigm where the student model provides feedback to the teacher LLM, which then generates tailored training data to address the student's deficiencies. This creates a customized learning curriculum. 2) Self-reflection learning where the student model learns from its own mistakes through contrastive learning. 3) Seamless integration of the multi-round learning and self-reflection enables continuous improvement of the student model. Experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning datasets demonstrate significant gains over baseline distillation methods. The approach facilitates democratizing the exclusive reasoning abilities of large models to smaller, more accessible models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a tailored learning approach to distill reasoning ability from large language models (LLMs) to smaller language models. The method consists of a multi-round interactive learning paradigm between a student LM and a teacher LLM. In each round, the student LM first takes an "exam" on the training data to collect mistakes and wrong rationales. These mistakes serve as feedback for the teacher LLM, which then generates customized training data with correct rationales tailored to the student's deficiencies. In addition to learning from the teacher LLM, the student LM also undertakes self-reflection learning on its mistakes to further improve its reasoning skills. These two learning approaches are integrated into the multi-round paradigm, where the student LM gradually enhances its reasoning through successive rounds of feedback with the teacher LLM and learning from mistakes. Experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively transfers reasoning skills from large to small LMs, outperforming existing distillation methods. Key benefits include utilizing the teacher LLM more actively, multi-round mutual feedback, and self-reflection learning.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) A multi-round learning paradigm with student-teacher interaction and feedback. 2) Self-reflection learning on mistakes to exploit reasoning potential of small LMs. 3) Tailored learning from both mistakes and teacher LLM enables significant reasoning gains for small LMs on multiple benchmarks. The approach facilitates democratizing exclusive reasoning skills from large models to make them accessible to broader communities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a tailored learning approach to distill reasoning ability from large language models (LLMs) to smaller language models (LMs). The method involves a multi-round interactive learning paradigm where the student LM provides feedback on its deficiencies to the teacher LLM, which then provides customized training data in response. Specifically, in each round the student LM takes an "exam" to collect its mistakes made on the training data. These mistakes are used to prompt the teacher LLM to generate tailored rationales that address the student's weaknesses. The student LM is then trained on this customized data along with self-reflection learning on its mistakes to improve its reasoning ability. The multi-round paradigm allows this interaction and tailored learning process to be iterated, with the teacher LLM continuously providing training data customized to the evolving deficiencies of the student LM. Experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this tailored multi-round learning approach with teacher-student interaction and self-reflection in improving the reasoning ability of smaller LMs.
