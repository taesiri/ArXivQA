# [Modular Visual Question Answering via Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05392)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether generating modular programs via code synthesis can improve performance on few-shot visual question answering, compared to more monolithic approaches based solely on large language models. Specifically, the authors introduce CodeVQA, a method that uses a code-generating language model to produce modular Python programs for answering visual questions. These programs make use of predefined visual primitives and control flow to reason about the question and image(s). The key hypothesis is that this more compositional approach will generalize better in the few-shot setting compared to just using a large LM directly on the question and image captions.The authors evaluate CodeVQA on the GQA, COVR, and NLVR2 datasets in the few-shot setting against strong LM baselines. The results show CodeVQA outperforming baselines by 2-3%, supporting the hypothesis that modular code synthesis provides benefits for few-shot VQA beyond just using a capable LM. The analysis also reveals the biggest gains on spatial reasoning and conditional questions where CodeVQA can break the complex question into simpler modular pieces.In summary, the central hypothesis is that code synthesis for modular program execution can enhance few-shot VQA performance over monolithic LM approaches, which the experiments and analysis generally validate. The modular approach provides more systematic compositional reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose CodeVQA, a framework for visual question answering (VQA) that formulates VQA as modular code generation using large language models. 2. CodeVQA generates Python code to compose predefined visual primitives based on the input question. The visual primitives are wrappers around pre-trained vision-language models and probe the image to extract relevant information.3. CodeVQA does not require retraining modules or parsers like prior modular VQA methods. It can adapt to new VQA distributions in a few-shot manner via prompting.4. They evaluate CodeVQA on few-shot VQA and show it outperforms prior few-shot VQA methods, especially on datasets requiring reasoning over multiple images like COVR.5. They demonstrate CodeVQA can achieve strong performance on GQA using only models pre-trained on image-text data, without relying on supervised VQA models.6. Their analysis shows the benefits of CodeVQA's modularity and program synthesis, compared to a competitive few-shot baseline using the same in-context learning and models.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new framework CodeVQA that achieves strong few-shot VQA performance by formulating VQA as modular code generation using pre-trained language and vision models. The modularity and program synthesis aspects are key.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a framework for visual question answering that uses a language model to generate Python programs invoking pre-trained visual modules, improving accuracy in the few-shot setting without additional model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on CodeVQA compares to other recent research on few-shot and modular approaches for visual question answering:- It focuses on leveraging recent advances in large language models for program synthesis, rather than training specialized neural module networks. This allows adapting to new reasoning skills with just a small number of demonstration examples, rather than retraining modules.- The main comparison is against a strong few-shot baseline using the same in-context learning approach and LM, isolating the benefits of program synthesis. Other recent papers have not analyzed this as directly. - The framework relies only on pretrained vision-language models like BLIP rather than supervised VQA or object detection models. This is a simpler setup than some other recent modular VQA methods.- The use of full Python programs allows more complex reasoning and control flow compared to more constrained domain-specific languages.- The overall accuracy results are strong, outperforming prior few-shot VQA techniques, especially on the challenging COVR dataset requiring reasoning over multiple images.- There is some analysis of the sources of errors, highlighting issues in executing the generated programs vs challenges in program synthesis.- Limitations discussed include lower performance than fully supervised approaches, need for further improvements to support more primitives, and high computational cost.Overall, the paper makes contributions in effectively applying recent advances in large LMs to program synthesis for VQA in a low resource setting, while providing useful analysis and comparisons to isolate the benefits. The results help demonstrate the promise of this paradigm for modular and adaptable VQA.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the accuracy of few-shot VQA methods with code synthesis to get closer to human-level performance. The results are promising but there is still a gap compared to human VQA accuracy and models finetuned on the datasets.- Extending the framework to support additional code primitives beyond the few used in this work. The results in the appendix show that simply adding new primitives does not always improve accuracy over the baseline. More research is needed on how to effectively incorporate new primitives.- Applying the approach to other languages beyond English by using multilingual language models. - Reducing the reliance on large language models, which have high computational costs. Exploring ways to make the framework more efficient while retaining the benefits.- Analyzing the sample efficiency and generalization ability of the approach more thoroughly. The authors demonstrate the potential but more systematic investigation along these lines could be valuable.- Exploring the interpretability benefits of having explicit programs. The authors mention this but do not provide an in-depth analysis.- Comparing to other structured representations like scene graphs. The modular programs offer one way to incorporate structure but comparing to alternative structured representations would be informative.- Investigating how the generated programs could inform the design of new visual primitives tailored to VQA. The error analysis could provide insights into what new building blocks would be useful.So in summary, the main directions mentioned are improving accuracy, extending to new primitives/languages, reducing computational costs, improving sample efficiency and generalization, leveraging interpretability, and using the programs to guide development of new VQA-focused primitives.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents CodeVQA, a framework for visual question answering (VQA) that formulates VQA as modular code generation. Given an image and question, CodeVQA first uses a code-generating language model to produce a Python program based on the question. This program invokes pre-defined visual modules implemented with pre-trained image-text models like BLIP. For example, the query module answers a question about an image by generating captions and prompting a language model, while the get_pos module localizes objects. The generated program composes these modules via conditionals, loops, arithmetic etc. to answer the question. CodeVQA is evaluated in a few-shot setting on VQA datasets like GQA and COVR. It outperforms previous few-shot VQA methods by using the full expressiveness of code to decompose questions rather than just prompting with the question text. The results demonstrate the potential of leveraging recent modular code-generating language models and visual-language models for VQA without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces CodeVQA, a framework that formulates visual question answering (VQA) as modular code generation. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in large language models (LMs) for code generation and vision-language models (VLMs) that can generate image captions and compute image-text similarities. CodeVQA takes a question as input and uses a code-generating LM to produce a Python program that answers the question by invoking predefined visual primitives implemented with VLMs. These primitives allow probing the image for captions, retrieving object locations, or finding the most relevant image. The program combines the outputs of the primitives using arithmetic, conditionals, loops, etc. to predict the answer. CodeVQA is evaluated in a few-shot setting on VQA datasets. It outperforms prior few-shot VQA methods, especially on datasets requiring reasoning over multiple images, suggesting the benefits of modularity and code synthesis without model re-training. Compared to neural module networks, CodeVQA avoids the need for parsers or joint training and benefits from replacing individual modules. The results demonstrate that with recent LMs and VLMs, the advantages of classic modular AI can be realized for VQA.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:The paper introduces CodeVQA, a framework for visual question answering (VQA) that formulates VQA as modular code generation. Given an image and question, CodeVQA first uses a code-generating language model (LM) to generate a Python program based solely on the question. This program invokes visual primitives implemented with pre-trained vision-language models. For example, the query primitive answers a question about an image by generating captions and prompting a QA LM, while get_pos finds an object's position using image-text matching. The generated program composes these modular primitives using arithmetic, conditionals, loops, etc. to predict the answer. CodeVQA relies only on the LM, vision-language models trained on image-caption data, and a small number of expert-annotated programs as in-context learning examples. It does not require end-to-end training or a syntactic parser. The paper shows CodeVQA outperforms prior few-shot VQA techniques, demonstrating the benefits of modular code generation without model re-training.
