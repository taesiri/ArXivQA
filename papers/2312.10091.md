# [Look Before You Leap: A Universal Emergent Decomposition of Retrieval   Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As language models (LMs) reach advanced capabilities, efficiently supervising their internal processes becomes critical for safety. However, existing techniques only examine model outputs, not internal mechanisms, limiting oversight. The paper introduces the problem of "internal oversight" - verifying models solve problems correctly internally.  

The paper also lacks techniques to study LMs on diverse tasks at scale to find common internal structures. Prior work uses narrow, custom-designed datasets limiting discoveries.

Solution: 
The paper makes 3 main contributions:

1) Introduces ORION, a collection of retrieval tasks spanning diverse domains, enabling large-scale causal analysis. ORION tasks share an abstract structure where the "context" provides information and the "request" queries an attribute.

2) Discovers models decomposed retrieval tasks into processing the request then retrieving information from the context, with clean separation of layers handling each step. This held across 18 models and 6 domains, suggesting an "emergent universal motif".

3) Leverages this decomposition for a proof-of-concept of scalable "internal oversight", using causal interventions to mitigate prompt injection in QA requiring human verification on only one input. Technique drastically improves performance on adversarial examples.

Overall, the paper proposes studying models via high-level causal structures rather than narrow cases. It shows this can discover task commonalities across models and enable oversight applications. The work pioneers using interpretability for scalable internal model safety.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ORION, a collection of structured retrieval tasks used to discover the universal emergent decomposition of request processing and context understanding in the internal mechanisms of language models that is then leveraged to demonstrate scalable internal oversight on a question answering task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing ORION, a collection of structured retrieval tasks to enable comparative causal analysis of language models across different domains and scales.

2. Discovering a universal emergent modular decomposition of retrieval tasks in language models, where mid layers process the request and late layers retrieve information from the context. This decomposition was found to generalize across 18 models and 6 task domains. 

3. Linking the macroscopic decomposition with a microscopic analysis through a case study on a question answering task, showing the macroscopic modularity emerges from variable low-level mechanisms.

4. Demonstrating a proof-of-concept application of the internal task decomposition to mitigate prompt injection on a question answering task. This is presented as evidence that scalable internal oversight of language models is feasible.

In summary, the key innovation of this work is using causal analysis on a structured task collection to uncover universal patterns in language model internals and translate this understanding into safer language models requiring less human oversight.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Language models (LMs) - The paper studies the internal mechanisms of large autoregressive language models like GPT-2, Pythia, Falcon, and Llama 2.

- Retrieval tasks - The paper introduces a collection of structured retrieval tasks called ORION spanning question answering, translation, factual recall, variable binding, abstract pattern matching, and coding.

- Causal analysis - The paper applies causal interventions like residual stream patching to study how LMs solve retrieval tasks. 

- Modular decomposition - A key finding is the emergent decomposition of retrieval tasks in LMs, with separate layers handling request processing and context retrieval. 

- Macroscopic vs microscopic analysis - The paper links coarse-grained causal analysis of layers with a finer-grained case study of components in Pythia-2.8b.

- Scalable oversight - A proof of concept application is demonstrated to mitigate prompt injection in LMs using the modular decomposition, requiring supervision on only a single input.

- Comparative analysis - The ORION tasks and structured representation enable comparative causal analysis across diverse models, architectures, and task domains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces ORION, a collection of structured retrieval tasks, as a tool to enable comparative causal analysis across models and tasks. How does the structure and abstraction in ORION facilitate designing and interpreting interventions systematically across diverse settings? What are some limitations of this approach?

2. The paper discovers request-patching, an emergent phenomenon where middle layer residual streams encode task requests separately from context processing in later layers. Does this modular separation fully characterize how models solve retrieval tasks? Could other complementary mechanisms be at play?  

3. To what extent does the modular separation happen redundantly across layers versus being cleanly divided? How does request-patching change with scale and architecture?

4. The paper links the macroscopic view with a microscopic analysis on a QA task. How well does the modular separation hold at the fine-grained scale of attention heads and MLP blocks? What mechanisms enable request-patching to steer components not processing the patched request?

5. How does the nature of the task, such as simplicity, domain, or request structure, influence the layer at which request-patching occurs? Are there settings where the phenomenon fails to emerge?

6. The paper demonstrates an application to mitigate prompt injection, but relies partially on human oversight. What avenues exist to extend and automate the oversight, such as using an ensemble of trusted prompts or probes that detect anomalous mechanisms? 

7. Could the modular separation discovered via request-patching be leveraged to build more interpretable systems, such as models that expose isolated request and context representations for inspection?

8. The paper focuses on causal analysis through residual stream patching. What additional interventions could elucidate the role of components upstream and downstream of patched layers in solving retrieval tasks?

9. Request-patching overwrites context processing in later layers. Are there alternative interventions that could isolate request processing while preserving context handling for more precise oversight?

10. What insights from comparative causal analysis of retrieval tasks could guide architecture innovations to explicitly encode structural priors that lead to more controllable, safer models?
