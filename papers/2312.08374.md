# [Unsupervised Social Event Detection via Hybrid Graph Contrastive   Learning and Reinforced Incremental Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Detecting events from social media streams is challenging due to the diverse, rapidly updating nature of the data. Existing methods have two key limitations: 
1) Conventional graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques only capture partial attributes of social media messages, insufficient for learning highly discriminative representations.  
2) Current embedding clustering techniques rely on specific prior knowledge (e.g. number of clusters K), conflicting with unsupervised learning.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called HCRC - Hybrid Graph Contrastive learning and Reinforced incremental Clustering, with two key components:

1) Hybrid Graph Contrastive Learning: Constructs two graphs - social message attribute graph and social message relation graph. Applies graph-level and node-level contrastive learning on them to comprehensively learn semantic and structural information. This allows capturing multi-faceted discriminative information from social messages.

2) Reinforced Incremental Clustering: Formulates incremental clustering as a Markov Decision Process and uses deep reinforcement learning to determine cluster thresholds. Removes reliance on prior knowledge like number of clusters, enabling solidly unsupervised incremental detection.

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensive learning of discriminative information from social messages via hybrid graph contrastive learning on attribute and relation graphs.
2) Deep reinforcement learning based incremental clustering that is purely unsupervised and adaptive.

The extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with NMI improvements of up to 53% in traditional incremental setting. The approach is robust across supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised settings.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents a novel unsupervised social event detection architecture called HCRC (Hybrid graph Contrastive learning and Reinforced incremental Clustering).

2. It proposes a simple yet effective approach to building social message graphs for comprehensively capturing semantic and structural information. 

3. It introduces a hybrid graph contrastive learning method with both node-level and graph-level contrasting to boost the model's ability to learn discriminative representations of social messages.
