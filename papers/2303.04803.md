# [Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with Text-to-Image Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04803)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:Can large-scale text-to-image diffusion models and text-image discriminative models be leveraged together to perform open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation of any concept in the wild?The key hypothesis is that the internal representation of text-to-image diffusion models is semantically rich and spatially differentiated enough to enable open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation when combined with text-image discriminative models. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel method called ODISE that combines a frozen pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and a text-image discriminative model like CLIP to perform state-of-the-art open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. The core ideas are:1) The internal representations of text-to-image diffusion models are highly correlated with visual semantics and spatial layouts, as evidenced by their ability to generate high-quality images from text descriptions. 2) Text-image discriminative models like CLIP are good at classifying images into open-vocabulary textual labels.3) By combining the strengths of both models, the spatial and semantic representations from the diffusion model and the open-vocabulary classification ability of the discriminative model, the proposed ODISE approach can perform panoptic segmentation and recognition of objects and regions in the wild using an open-vocabulary of labels.The paper provides extensive experiments to validate this hypothesis, and shows state-of-the-art results on various open-vocabulary panoptic and semantic segmentation benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior art.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- They propose ODISE, a novel method that leverages both text-to-image diffusion models and text-image discriminative models to perform open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. - They show that the internal representation of text-to-image diffusion models is semantically differentiated and correlated to high/mid-level concepts, making it very suitable for segmentation tasks.- They introduce an implicit captioner module that allows extracting optimal diffusion model features even when image captions are not available.- They significantly advance the state-of-the-art in open-vocabulary recognition by outperforming prior methods by a large margin on panoptic and semantic segmentation benchmarks.- They demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging frozen large-scale generative models pre-trained on web data for recognition tasks.In summary, this paper makes both technical and empirical contributions in advancing open-vocabulary recognition by proposing a novel fusion of diffusion and discriminative models, and shows its effectiveness on multiple segmentation tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art. The key insight is that diffusion models provide semantically richer representations that outperform other pre-trained visual features.
