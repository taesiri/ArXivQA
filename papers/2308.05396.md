# [Learning Gabor Texture Features for Fine-Grained Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05396)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can texture features extracted using Gabor filters be effectively incorporated into a deep neural network framework to improve fine-grained image recognition performance?The key hypothesis appears to be:By carefully designing a texture branch with learnable Gabor filters and complementing it with a region selection gate, texture features can provide valuable supplementary information to standard CNN features for fine-grained recognition tasks. The combination of texture and semantic features can lead to state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the paper explores whether Gabor filter based texture features can complement CNN semantic features to boost fine-grained recognition accuracy. Through innovative network designs and learning strategies, the authors aim to effectively integrate Gabor filters into a deep learning framework and validate their benefits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel network that utilizes Gabor filters to extract texture features as a complement to the semantic features from a CNN backbone for fine-grained recognition. The key aspects of the contribution include:- Introducing a Gabor filter based texture branch to extract local and high-frequency texture features that are lost in the CNN features. This provides complementary information to the semantic CNN features for fine-grained classification.- Designing effective methods to learn the parameters of Gabor filters in a stable and optimal manner, including using value constraints and a dual-range strategy. This overcomes limitations like training instability and frequency bias faced by prior works.- Proposing statistical feature extractors like Learnable Histogram Operator and Filter Correlation Module to effectively exploit texture information from Gabor response maps.- Introducing a region selection gate based on improved semantic hashing to select informative regions for texture feature extraction. This reduces redundancy and computational costs.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on multiple fine-grained datasets by integrating the textual features from the proposed Gabor filter branch with semantic CNN features.In summary, the key novelty is the design of a Gabor filter based texture branch and associated techniques to enable effective extraction and integration of complementary texture features to improve fine-grained recognition performance.
