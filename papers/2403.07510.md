# [Relevance Score: A Landmark-Like Heuristic for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07510)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Landmark-based heuristics have been very successful for guiding search in automated planning. Landmarks are facts/actions that must be achieved at some point in all valid plans. However, computing complete landmark information is expensive and many planning problems lack non-trivial landmarks beyond those in the initial state or goals. This limits the effectiveness of landmark-based heuristics on such problems.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new "relevance score" heuristic that generalizes landmarks. Rather than facts/actions that must occur in all plans, it estimates how frequently each fact/action occurs across the space of possible plans. Facts irrelevant to achieving the goals will have low scores, while those critical to all plans will be landmarks with maximal scores. This provides an informative heuristic even when no non-trivial landmarks exist.

Computation: 
The relevance score is computed by sampling state trajectories using a hypothetical non-deterministic planning agent. The agent randomly selects actions that achieve required facts until reaching the goals. The score estimates the probability that each fact/action would be sampled across many trajectories. The final heuristic sums the scores of facts not yet achieved.

Contributions:
- Formalizes the concept of a relevance score that generalizes landmarks to capture facts/actions that commonly appear in plans without requiring they appear in all plans
- Provides equations to incrementally compute this score during search tree construction
- Empirically demonstrates that while more expensive on normal planning problems, the relevance score heuristic can solve problems on which landmark-counting fails by lacking heuristics gradients
- Suggests a hybrid approach that uses each heuristic selectively based on the availability of non-trivial landmarks

Overall, the paper introduces a novel heuristic that advances state-of-the-art capabilities for planning problems lacking well-defined landmarks. The generality of the relevance score also creates opportunities to apply similar ideas to other search-based AI problems.
