# [Gemini in Reasoning: Unveiling Commonsense in Multimodal Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17661)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and understanding the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. 
- Recent models like Google's Gemini have shown potential shortcomings in commonsense reasoning based on limited assessments.
- Comprehensively evaluating Gemini's performance across diverse commonsense reasoning tasks remains a gap.

Methodology:
- The authors conduct extensive experiments on Gemini and other popular LLMs (Llama, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) using 12 commonsense reasoning datasets.
- 11 language datasets span general, contextual, temporal, social, numerical, physical commonsense. 
- 1 multimodal dataset (VCR) evaluates visual commonsense reasoning.
- Models are evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings to gauge inherent capabilities. 
- Accuracy is the main evaluation metric, along with qualitative analysis of reasoning processes.

Key Findings:
- GPT-4 leads in performance across most datasets and reasoning types.  
- Gemini exhibits comparable results to GPT-3.5, marginally outperforming it in language tasks but lagging in the multimodal dataset.
- Gemini demonstrates logically sound reasoning in 65.8% of cases, showing potential for real-world application.  
- It struggles with temporal and social commonsense reasoning specifically.
- In multimodal contexts, Gemini finds recognizing emotions in images challenging.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of Gemini for commonsense reasoning using diverse language and multimodal datasets.
- Evaluation revealing Gemini's competitive language reasoning capabilities compared to GPT-3.5, with limitations in certain domains.
- Identification of areas needing enhancement in current LLMs/MLLMs for nuanced commonsense reasoning.
- Valuable benchmark with datasets/results for advancing research in this critical area of AI.

In summary, the paper offers crucial insights into the commonsense reasoning skills of cutting-edge models like Gemini, highlights promising capabilities as well as deficiencies, and lays groundwork to address the challenges towards more advanced AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), with a particular focus on assessing Google's Gemini model across 12 diverse datasets spanning textual and visual domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are summarized in the authors' own words in the Introduction section:

1) They provide the first thorough evaluation of Gemini Pro's efficacy in commonsense reasoning tasks, employing 12 diverse datasets that span both language-based and multimodal scenarios.

2) Their study reveals that Gemini Pro exhibits performance comparable to GPT-3.5 Turbo in language-only commonsense reasoning tasks, demonstrating logical and contextual reasoning processes. However, it lags behind GPT-4 Turbo in accuracy and encounters challenges in temporal and social reasoning, as well as in emotion recognition in images.

3) Their findings lay a valuable foundation for future research in the field of commonsense reasoning within LLMs and MLLMs, highlighting the necessity to enhance specialized domains in these models and the nuanced recognition of mental states and emotions in multimodal contexts.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of the commonsense reasoning capabilities of the Gemini language model across diverse tasks and modalities, revealing its strengths and weaknesses to guide future research towards improving commonsense reasoning in large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper evaluates Gemini's performance across 12 diverse commonsense reasoning datasets. What were the key factors considered when selecting these datasets to ensure a comprehensive assessment of Gemini's capabilities?

2. The paper employs both language-only datasets as well as one multimodal dataset for evaluation. What are the unique challenges posed by multimodal commonsense reasoning tasks compared to language-only tasks? How does the inclusion of visual information affect an AI system's reasoning process?

3. The authors utilize multiple prompting techniques such as standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting across the evaluations. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these prompting approaches? What kinds of commonsense reasoning abilities does each prompt style tend to target or assess?  

4. What types of commonsense knowledge (e.g. physical, temporal, social) tend to be most challenging for models like Gemini? What underlying deficiencies in the models contribute to poorer performance on these types of reasoning?

5. This study finds Gemini exhibits limitations in temporal and social commonsense reasoning. What enhancements could be incorporated into Gemini to strengthen its capabilities in these areas specifically?  

6. The error analysis reveals tendencies such as context misinterpretation and overgeneralization. How might the training process of models like Gemini be refined to reduce these types of errors in commonsense reasoning tasks?

7. How suitable are current evaluation metrics and benchmarks for assessing the nuances of commonsense reasoning? What new evaluation methodologies could lead to more accurate understandings of AI systems' reasoning capacities?

8. The study utilizes greedy decoding for generating model responses. How might alternative decoding methods like beam search affect the commonsense reasoning performance? What are the tradeoffs?

9. What kinds of commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities are still lacking or suboptimal in state-of-the-art models like Gemini? What should be the priority areas to address as next steps?

10. How do cultural biases and assumptions affect commonsense reasoning? Should multicultural perspectives be incorporated into training and evaluation? If so, what is the best approach?
