# [CoRelation: Boosting Automatic ICD Coding Through Contextualized Code   Relation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current ICD coding methods have limitations in effectively modeling the relationships between ICD codes. Specifically, they only use the code ontology or co-occurrence graph which are insufficient to capture the intricate relationships. Also, they ignore the importance of context when learning the code relations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new contextualized code relation learning framework called CoRelation to address the limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Contextualized Code Embedding: Use a synonym-based attention method to extract contextualized embeddings for each ICD code from the clinical notes. This provides context-aware representations.

2) Flexible Code Relation Graph: Construct a flexible bipartite graph dynamically for each case to model contextualized relations between codes. Simplify the graph using major code substitution and top-K code selection for efficiency.

3) Contextualized Relation Modeling: Use graph transformer to update the embeddings on the simplified graph. Initialize the nodes using embeddings from Step 1 to make it context-aware. 

4) Self-Adaptive Aggregation: Combine the prediction probabilities from direct embedding and graph-enhanced embedding using a learnable gating mechanism.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a flexible, contextualized framework CoRelation to effectively model code relationships tailored to each case.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on 6 benchmarks including MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, outperforming previous methods.
- Provides improved explainability by enabling interpretation of meaningful learned relationships between codes.
- Introduces techniques like major code substitution, top-K selection and selective training to improve efficiency.

In summary, the paper presents a novel contextualized modeling approach for learning dynamic code relationships to enhance ICD coding. The proposed CoRelation method advances the state-of-the-art by flexibly modeling relationships while improving efficiency and explainability.
