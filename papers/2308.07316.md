# [Jurassic World Remake: Bringing Ancient Fossils Back to Life via   Zero-Shot Long Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07316)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we perform image-to-image translation across large domain gaps in a constrained and meaningful way?

The key points are:

- Most prior work in image-to-image translation (I2I) focuses on small domain gaps between source and target images (e.g. photo to painting). 

- For large domain gaps, there is a lack of meaningful tasks with verifiable constraints, allowing unsupervised drastic changes during translation.

- This paper introduces a new dataset and task - Skull2Animal - for translating skulls to living animals. This requires generating lots of new visual features and making inferences about geometry while remaining faithful to the source.

- The paper shows that unguided GAN methods fail at this task, while guided diffusion models can succeed due to their understanding of the target domain. 

- They propose a new model Revive-2I that uses text prompting of latent diffusion models to provide strong guidance for the target domain in a zero-shot manner without retraining classifiers.

In summary, the key research question is how to do meaningful and constrained image translation across large visual domain gaps, which requires generating lots of new features guided by knowledge of the target domain. The paper explores this through the Skull2Animal task and Revive-2I model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a new long image-to-image translation task called Skull2Animal for translating between skulls and living animals. This requires generating lots of new visual features and making inferences about geometry while maintaining faithfulness to the source image. 

2. Showing that unguided GAN methods are unable to successfully perform this long image translation across a large domain gap.

3. Providing a new benchmark model called Revive-2I that is capable of zero-shot image-to-image translation by prompting pre-trained latent diffusion models.

4. Demonstrating that guidance (either classifier-based or text-based) is necessary for long image-to-image translation, as Revive-2I and other guided diffusion models outperform unguided GANs.

5. Finding that text prompting provides a more flexible and scalable way to incorporate guidance compared to classifier-based guidance, as it does not require retraining models for new classes.

6. Showing that partial forward diffusion steps help retain source image faithfulness compared to full forward diffusion.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating a new challenging long image translation task, and developing a scalable zero-shot benchmark model using prompted latent diffusion that outperforms other methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset Skull2Animal for image-to-image translation between skulls and living animals, baselines existing methods like GANs and guided diffusion, and proposes a new method Revive-2I that performs zero-shot I2I via prompting latent diffusion models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in image-to-image translation and diffusion models:

- The task of translating across large domain gaps (long I2I) has been explored before, but many prior works lack meaningful or verifiable constraints. This paper introduces the Skull2Animal dataset which provides a challenging but grounded long I2I task.

- The paper demonstrates that unguided GAN methods struggle with long I2I tasks that require generating lots of new visual features and geometry. This aligns with findings from other papers. 

- The authors baseline existing guided diffusion methods like DDIB, showing they can perform long I2I but have limitations like needing retraining for new classes. This provides useful benchmarks.

- The main contribution is proposing Revive-2I to perform long I2I via prompting latent diffusion models. This is novel compared to prior work:

    - It leverages the strong natural language understanding of CLIP instead of just classifier guidance like DDIB.

    - It performs diffusion in the latent space which is more efficient.

    - It shows that partial diffusion steps help retain source information.

- The idea of using language guidance and latent diffusion for control has been explored for text-to-image and image editing, but this paper uniquely applies it to long I2I translation.

- The results demonstrate Revive-2I's advantages over GANs and baseline diffusion methods on the challenging Skull2Animal task.

In summary, while long I2I and diffusion models are established areas, this paper provides novel contributions in terms of the dataset, baselines, and proposing a prompting latent diffusion approach that demonstrates advantages over prior methods for constrained, grounded long I2I tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving faithfulness to the source image: The authors note limitations in retaining the orientation and only generating the head of the animal from the skull. They suggest further work could improve faithfulness by finetuning the stable diffusion model on animal heads or incorporating techniques like null-text inversion.

- Generalizing to unseen classes: The authors tried prompting with more generic text like "a photo of a mammal" but it just generated popular dog breeds. More work is needed to enable generation of novel or unseen classes from more abstract prompts.

- Incorporating additional modalities: The paper focuses on translating from skull images to animal photos. The authors suggest extending it to translate sketches or verbal descriptions to generate criminal identikits. 

- Applications to paleontology: The authors propose applications to bringing dinosaurs and other extinct animals back to life from fossils. Further developing the method to work on these types of inputs could be an interesting direction.

- Optimizing diffusion process: The authors found varying the amount of forward diffusion steps helped balance faithfulness and quality. More work could be done to automatically optimize these hyperparameters for different I2I tasks.

- Combining with other techniques: The authors suggest combining Revive-2I with null-text inversion or prompt tuning to further improve results. Exploring integration with other related methods could help address limitations.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving faithfulness, generalizability, incorporating new modalities and techniques, and developing real-world applications especially in paleontology. Advancing the method along these dimensions could enable broader adoption.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset called Skull2Animal for the task of translating skulls into images of living animals. This is a challenging image-to-image translation task across a large domain gap, requiring generating significant new visual features and geometry while remaining faithful to the original image. The authors show that standard GAN methods fail at this task, while guided diffusion models can succeed by incorporating prior knowledge about the target domain. They introduce a new method called Revive-2I that performs the diffusion process in the latent space, replaces classifier guidance with text prompts for more flexibility, and uses partial forward diffusion steps to retain source image fidelity. Revive-2I produces promising results on the Skull2Animal dataset, outperforming unguided GANs and baseline guided diffusion. The model translates skulls into realistic images of living animals while often maintaining the head pose. Limitations remain in fully preserving source image faithfulness. The proposed dataset and task offer a grounded, scientific application for image translation across large gaps.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset called Skull2Animal for image-to-image translation between animal skulls and living animals. The dataset contains unpaired images of mammal skulls and living animals sourced from other datasets. The task requires generating large amounts of new visual features and making inferences about geometry while maintaining faithfulness to the original skull image. This is more challenging than previous image translation tasks. The paper shows that unguided GAN methods like CycleGAN and ACL-GAN fail at this task, producing artifacts or failing to generate new geometry. Guided diffusion methods like DDIB perform better by incorporating knowledge about the target domain. The authors propose a new method called Revive-2I that replaces DDIB's classifier guidance with text prompts, making it faster, more flexible to new classes, and more robust. Revive-2I performs translation in the latent space and uses partial diffusion steps to retain source information. Results show it outperforms baselines at translating skulls to living animals while maintaining orientation. Limitations are lack of full faithfulness to source and difficulty generalizing to unseen classes. The constrained long image translation setup is novel and challenging.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) The Skull2Animal dataset for constrained, long image-to-image translation. 2) Showing unguided GANs fail at this task while guided diffusion models do better. 3) Proposing the Revive-2I method to replace classifier guidance with text prompts for faster, more flexible translation. 4) Results showing Revive-2I outperforms baselines at skull to animal translation while maintaining orientation. 5) Analysis of limitations around faithfulness and generalizing to new classes. Overall, it presents a new challenging task and baseline methods to motivate further research.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Revive-2I, a method for zero-shot image-to-image translation across large domain gaps. Revive-2I is based on stable diffusion, a text-guided latent diffusion model. The method has three main components: 1) It performs diffusion in the latent space which is faster and more computationally efficient. 2) It replaces the classifier guidance used in previous methods like DDIB with text prompts. This allows it to translate between arbitrary domains described by text without retraining classifiers. 3) It performs only a partial number of steps in the forward diffusion process before decoding. This retains some influence of the source image to make the translation more faithful. Together, these changes allow Revive-2I to flexibly translate images across large domain gaps in a zero-shot manner using only text guidance, while remaining efficient and faithful to the source image.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It introduces a new dataset called Skull2Animal for image-to-image translation between skulls and living animals. This is posed as a challenging "long I2I" task that requires generating a large number of new visual features and inferring geometry while being faithful to the source image.

- Existing I2I methods using GANs struggle with this long I2I task. Methods like CycleGAN can produce some dog-like features but fail to properly structure them or understand orientation. ACL-GAN gets stuck retaining the entire skull. 

- The paper proposes using guided diffusion models like DDIB and a new method called Revive-2I. These leverage guidance from a classifier or text prompt to provide knowledge about the target domain.

- Revive-2I replaces DDIB's classifier with text prompts for more flexibility. It also performs diffusion in the latent space for efficiency and does partial forward diffusion steps to retain source fidelity.

- Experiments show Revive-2I outperforms GANs and DDIB for skull to animal translation. The text guidance provides a more constrained generation process. Partial diffusion is important for faithfulness.

In summary, the key question is how to do constrained long I2I translation across large visual domain gaps, which existing GAN methods fail at. The paper proposes guided diffusion as a solution, with Revive-2I improving on DDIB's approach.
