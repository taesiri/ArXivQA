# Visual Chain of Thought: Bridging Logical Gaps with Multimodal   Infillings

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is: How can we bridge the logical gaps in reasoning within sequential data to improve downstream performance?The authors argue that incorporating visual augmentation into reasoning is essential for complex, imaginative tasks. They propose a novel method called Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT) that leverages chain of thought prompting with vision-language grounding to recursively bridge the logical gaps within sequential data. The key hypothesis is that generating synthetic multimodal infillings that add consistent and novel information will reduce the logical gaps and improve performance on downstream tasks that benefit from temporal reasoning, such as visual storytelling and instruction summarization.In summary, the paper introduces VCoT to bridge logical gaps in sequential reasoning and tests the hypothesis that the multimodal infillings generated by VCoT will enhance downstream task performance that relies on this type of reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT), a novel method that leverages chain of thought prompting with vision-language grounding to recursively bridge the logical gaps within sequential data. The key ideas are:- Transforming text-only datasets like VIST and WikiHow into multimodal text-visual pairs to unify different sequential reasoning tasks. - Using "multipoint foveation" to extract the core semantic focus from the input sequence. This guides the model to generate consistent and relevant infillings.- Recursively generating multimodal (text + image) "infillings" to fill in the logical gaps between elements in the input sequence. This is done by generating multiple text and image candidates and selecting the ones most consistent with the context.- Showing through human evaluation that VCoT generates more novel and consistent infillings compared to text-only and image-only baselines. - Demonstrating that the synthetic infillings from VCoT improve performance on downstream tasks like visual storytelling and instruction summarization.In summary, the key contribution is proposing VCoT to augment sequential data with synthetic yet consistent multimodal infillings in order to enhance logical reasoning and downstream task performance. The method combines the efficiency of chain of thought with the benefits of visual grounding.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT), a novel method that utilizes chain of thought prompting with visual guidance to recursively generate multimodal infillings that bridge logical gaps and reduce reasoning leaps on sequential datasets like VIST storytelling and WikiHow instructions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The key innovation of this paper is using visual imagery and chain of thought prompting together to enhance reasoning and fill in logical gaps in sequential data. This is a novel combination that draws on the strengths of both approaches. Other papers have explored chain of thought prompting or using visual imagery separately, but not in conjunction. - This paper shows strong performance on improving sequential reasoning for downstream tasks compared to chain of thought or vision-only baselines. The gains on consistency and novelty metrics indicate the value of the multimodal approach. Other papers applying chain of thought or visual methods alone have not shown the same level of benefit.- The recursive generation of infillings is more dynamic than predetermined steps in typical chain of thought papers. This allows flexible filling of gaps rather than needing to specify the number of reasoning steps upfront. Other recursive reasoning papers like TRACT have not incorporated vision.- The visual grounding through techniques like multipoint foveation helps maintain consistency in a way that other vision-language papers do not emphasize. Keeping generations on-topic improves relevance.- The human evaluation methodology provides clearer insights into multimodal reasoning abilities than automatic metrics used by some other papers. However, there is still room to develop more diagnostic evaluations in future work.- The generality of the VCoT framework across VIST and WikiHow datasets demonstrates broader applicability than some other task-specific papers. However, more exploration on diverse task domains would be beneficial.In summary, this paper makes excellent progress combining strengths of different approaches and evaluating reasoning gains concretely. There remain opportunities to build on this research and further push the state-of-the-art in visual, multimodal reasoning. But the novel ideas proposed here advance the field meaningfully compared to prior work.
