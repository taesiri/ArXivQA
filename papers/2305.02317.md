# [Visual Chain of Thought: Bridging Logical Gaps with Multimodal   Infillings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02317)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is: 

How can we bridge the logical gaps in reasoning within sequential data to improve downstream performance?

The authors argue that incorporating visual augmentation into reasoning is essential for complex, imaginative tasks. They propose a novel method called Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT) that leverages chain of thought prompting with vision-language grounding to recursively bridge the logical gaps within sequential data. 

The key hypothesis is that generating synthetic multimodal infillings that add consistent and novel information will reduce the logical gaps and improve performance on downstream tasks that benefit from temporal reasoning, such as visual storytelling and instruction summarization.

In summary, the paper introduces VCoT to bridge logical gaps in sequential reasoning and tests the hypothesis that the multimodal infillings generated by VCoT will enhance downstream task performance that relies on this type of reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT), a novel method that leverages chain of thought prompting with vision-language grounding to recursively bridge the logical gaps within sequential data. The key ideas are:

- Transforming text-only datasets like VIST and WikiHow into multimodal text-visual pairs to unify different sequential reasoning tasks. 

- Using "multipoint foveation" to extract the core semantic focus from the input sequence. This guides the model to generate consistent and relevant infillings.

- Recursively generating multimodal (text + image) "infillings" to fill in the logical gaps between elements in the input sequence. This is done by generating multiple text and image candidates and selecting the ones most consistent with the context.

- Showing through human evaluation that VCoT generates more novel and consistent infillings compared to text-only and image-only baselines. 

- Demonstrating that the synthetic infillings from VCoT improve performance on downstream tasks like visual storytelling and instruction summarization.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing VCoT to augment sequential data with synthetic yet consistent multimodal infillings in order to enhance logical reasoning and downstream task performance. The method combines the efficiency of chain of thought with the benefits of visual grounding.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The key innovation of this paper is using visual imagery and chain of thought prompting together to enhance reasoning and fill in logical gaps in sequential data. This is a novel combination that draws on the strengths of both approaches. Other papers have explored chain of thought prompting or using visual imagery separately, but not in conjunction. 

- This paper shows strong performance on improving sequential reasoning for downstream tasks compared to chain of thought or vision-only baselines. The gains on consistency and novelty metrics indicate the value of the multimodal approach. Other papers applying chain of thought or visual methods alone have not shown the same level of benefit.

- The recursive generation of infillings is more dynamic than predetermined steps in typical chain of thought papers. This allows flexible filling of gaps rather than needing to specify the number of reasoning steps upfront. Other recursive reasoning papers like TRACT have not incorporated vision.

- The visual grounding through techniques like multipoint foveation helps maintain consistency in a way that other vision-language papers do not emphasize. Keeping generations on-topic improves relevance.

- The human evaluation methodology provides clearer insights into multimodal reasoning abilities than automatic metrics used by some other papers. However, there is still room to develop more diagnostic evaluations in future work.

- The generality of the VCoT framework across VIST and WikiHow datasets demonstrates broader applicability than some other task-specific papers. However, more exploration on diverse task domains would be beneficial.

In summary, this paper makes excellent progress combining strengths of different approaches and evaluating reasoning gains concretely. There remain opportunities to build on this research and further push the state-of-the-art in visual, multimodal reasoning. But the novel ideas proposed here advance the field meaningfully compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore applying VCoT in new domains that could benefit from synthetic data augmentation and improved reasoning abilities, such as procedural planning, DNA sequencing, and video understanding. The authors suggest VCoT could be broadly applicable to many sequence modeling tasks.

- Better leverage the generated multimodal infillings to align them with desired metrics for downstream task improvement. The authors mention further research could help integrate the infillings in a way that is optimized for the end goal.

- Develop automatic evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated infillings at scale. The authors relied on human evaluation but suggest automated metrics could be useful.

- Improve the image captioning module, which was a bottleneck in the VCoT pipeline. Better integrating the visual modality could enhance the overall approach.

- Develop more robust methods for dynamically determining how many infilling steps are needed, rather than fixing the recursion depth. The number of logical leaps varies across sequences.

- Experiment with generating more candidate infillings per step to potentially improve results, now that they restricted candidates due to compute constraints.

- Explore additional human evaluation criteria to provide further insight into the multimodal reasoning capabilities of the system.

- Apply VCoT to other multimodal tasks and datasets beyond VIST and WikiHow to continue assessing its versatility.

Overall, the authors propose several promising directions to build on VCoT's capabilities, robustness, interpretability, and applicability to diverse reasoning tasks involving sequential data across modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT), a novel method that combines chain of thought prompting with visual guidance to recursively generate multimodal text-image infillings that bridge logical gaps and enhance reasoning in sequential data. VCoT transforms text datasets into text-visual pairs, extracts a multipoint foveation to identify key focal points, and recursively generates infillings that are consistent with surrounding context based on CLIP embeddings. Experiments on the VIST storytelling and WikiHow summarization datasets show through human evaluation that VCoT generates infillings that are more consistent and novel compared to chain of thought and chain of images baselines. When used to augment downstream tasks, VCoT also improves performance, demonstrating its ability to strengthen reasoning by filling in logical gaps. Overall, VCoT offers a new multimodal reasoning paradigm that leverages the efficiency of chain of thought with the richness of visual imagination.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Visual Chain of Thought (VCoT), a novel method that uses multimodal infillings to improve reasoning in sequential data. VCoT takes a sequence of text-visual pairs and recursively generates synthetic text and image infillings to bridge the logical gaps between elements in the sequence. It first transforms text-only data into text-visual pairs using image generation models. Then it identifies the key focal points in the sequence using foveation. Next, it recursively generates candidate text and visual infillings, selecting the candidates that are most consistent with the surrounding context using CLIP embeddings. The infillings act as intermediate steps that reduce the logical leaps required for reasoning over sparse sequences. VCoT is applied to visual storytelling and instruction summarization tasks, where human evaluation shows it generates more consistent and novel infillings compared to text-only and image-only baselines. The synthetic data augmentation provided by VCoT infillings is shown to improve reasoning and performance on downstream tasks.
