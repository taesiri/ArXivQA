# [DejaVu: Conditional Regenerative Learning to Enhance Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01573)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve deep networks for dense prediction tasks such as segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal prediction using conditional image regeneration as an auxiliary training objective. 

The key hypothesis is that by including an additional loss term based on reconstructing the original input image from a corrupted version conditioned on the network's dense predictions, the network can learn to produce more accurate predictions with clearer boundaries and better spatial consistency.

In particular, the paper proposes a framework called "DejaVu" which involves:

1) Redacting the input image to remove certain structural information (e.g. by sparse sampling or frequency removal). 

2) Using a conditional regenerator module to reconstruct the original image from the redacted image and the network's dense predictions.

3) Adding the reconstruction loss as an auxiliary objective during training to encourage the base network to embed the missing structural information in its predictions.

The central hypothesis is that the requirement to reconstruct the original image will push the base network to learn more robust and spatially consistent features related to shapes and boundaries, thus improving the dense prediction performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel training framework called DejaVu to enhance the performance of deep neural networks for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal prediction. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- DejaVu uses a conditional image regeneration module that takes as input a redacted image (with some structure information removed) and the dense prediction output, and tries to reconstruct the original image. 

- The reconstruction loss from comparing the reconstructed and original images acts as an additional supervision signal to train the dense prediction network. It encourages the network to learn embeddings that contain accurate structure information needed for regeneration.

- The type of redaction applied to the input image can be controlled, e.g. sparse spatial sampling or frequency removal, to encourage learning specific kinds of structure.

- The DejaVu framework is very flexible and can enhance any existing dense prediction network architecture. It can also be extended with a shared attention mechanism, additional losses like text supervision, etc.

- Comprehensive experiments for semantic segmentation, depth estimation, surface normal prediction, on various datasets demonstrate that DejaVu consistently improves accuracy over strong baselines, establishes new state-of-the-art results, with no increase in inference computation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the conditional regenerative learning framework DejaVu to enhance dense prediction networks by providing an additional reconstruction-based training signal. The framework is flexible, broadly applicable, and delivers improved accuracy.
