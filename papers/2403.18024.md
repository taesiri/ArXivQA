# [Enriching Word Usage Graphs with Cluster Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Word usage graphs (WUGs) are valuable resources for modeling semantic change. They contain nodes representing usages of a target word, connected by edges weighted by semantic similarity between usages. Nodes are clustered into senses.
- However, WUG senses lack human-interpretable labels. Browsing all examples per cluster to understand the sense is cumbersome. This limits the usefulness of WUGs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Enrich WUG sense clusters with human-readable definitions using an encoder-decoder language model (DefGen) fine-tuned on definition generation.
- Compare DefGen to baselines selecting definitions from WordNet (Lesk) or retrieving similar WordNet definitions (GlossReader).
- Evaluate for English, German, Norwegian, Russian WUGs by having humans guess cluster based on definition.  

Main Contributions:
- Publicly released WUGs enriched with cluster definitions for multiple languages, to increase interpretability.
- DefGen outperforms Lesk and GlossReader in assigning distinctive, human-interpretable labels to WUG clusters. It works reasonably even without language-specific fine-tuning.
- Analysis of errors shows main issues are definitions being too broad or describing the wrong sense. But overall quality is high enough to aid analysis.
- Fine-tuned definition generation models for English, Norwegian and Russian are released to enable further research.

In summary, the paper enriches WUGs with sense definitions to increase interpretability. An encoder-decoder language model fine-tuned on definition generation is shown to assign distinctive cluster labels efficiently across languages. This moves towards explainable modeling of semantic change.
