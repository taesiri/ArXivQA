# [Automatic Data Retrieval for Cross Lingual Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14542)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: There is a lack of datasets for cross-lingual summarization from English to Indian languages like Hindi. Existing datasets often lack diversity as they use news headlines or article prefixes as summaries. They also may not comprehensively cover specific events. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose pairing up textual news articles and YouTube video descriptions covering the same events to create cross-lingual summarization data. They crawl ~150K YouTube descriptions and ~350K news articles in English and Hindi. They match the articles and video descriptions by date, unigram overlap after translation, and semantic text similarity. After filtering, they retain ~8K cross-lingual and ~14K monolingual summarization pairs.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of a cross-lingual summarization dataset with 28,583 English-Hindi article-summary pairs extracted and aligned from diverse news and YouTube sources.
- Analysis of multiple baselines (IndicBART, mBART, mT5) on the new dataset. mBART performs the best.
- Detailed error analysis revealing issues like grammatical errors, factuality issues, omissions etc. in current multilingual models, especially for low-resource cross-lingual summarization.

The new dataset enables benchmarking of models for English-Hindi mono and cross-lingual summarization. Analysis reveals current models still have significant limitations in handling low-resource cross-lingual tasks. The paper provides a methodology to create cross-lingual datasets leveraging multimodal news sources.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to create mono and cross-lingual summarization datasets for English and Hindi by aligning news articles with corresponding YouTube video descriptions covering the same events, resulting in over 28K document-summary pairs used to train and evaluate summarization models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The paper proposes a method to create a substantial summarization dataset comprising 28,583 document-summary pairs by pairing up YouTube video descriptions with corresponding news article coverage of the same events from multiple sources. This allows for diversity in the data and more comprehensive event coverage compared to using article headlines or prefixes as summaries. The paper makes this dataset publicly available for English-English, English-Hindi, and Hindi-Hindi language pairs to promote research in monolingual and cross-lingual summarization, particularly for low-resource Indian languages. Additionally, the paper experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual summarization models on the new dataset and performs error analysis to benchmark performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

In summary, the key contribution is the creation and release of a large cross-lingual summarization dataset spanning English and Hindi, along with benchmarking of current summarization methods to motivate further research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using similarity thresholds for filtering out bad summaries. What were the exact similarity metrics used and what thresholds were set for monolingual vs cross-lingual summarization? 

2. The paper uses a parallel dictionary lookup or transliteration for computing unigram overlap between English and Hindi texts. What specific resources were used for this? Were there any challenges faced in handling words that could not be mapped?

3. What was the compression ratio distribution observed in the final filtered summaries? Were there noticeable differences in compression ratios between monolingual and cross-lingual pairs? 

4. The paper experiments with IndicBART, mBART and mT5 models. What were the key architectural and optimization differences between these models that could explain the performance gaps observed? 

5. For the extractive oracle baseline, what sentence scoring metrics were experimented with? Was ROUGE used or were other metrics like BertScore also tried out? 

6. The error analysis reveals omitting relevant information as a major issue. Did the authors analyze any patterns in what content gets omitted by different models? 

7. The paper mentions opportunities for more effective multilingual models. What techniques like using shared vocabularies or encoders could help address this?

8. How reliable was the dating criteria used for aligning article and video descriptions? Could there be latency in reporting across different media that makes this error prone?

9. What quality checks were done on the YouTube transcriptions to account for any errors in automatically generated captions? 

10. For the semantic similarity computation, were any other embedding methods besides DistUSE tried out? How do the results vary with different embeddings?
