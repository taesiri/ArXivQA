# [TMT: Tri-Modal Translation between Speech, Image, and Text by Processing   Different Modalities as Different Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Building unified models that can process multi-modal information (image, speech, text) is important for artificial general intelligence, but faces challenges due to the limited paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements of multi-modal learning.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) framework that can freely translate between image, speech and text modalities using a single model. 
- Introduce a new viewpoint of interpreting different modalities as different "languages" and treat multi-modal translation as a machine translation problem.
- Tokenize raw image, speech and text into discrete tokens using modality-specific tokenizers. This provides a unified interface for the modalities and significantly reduces computational cost.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore translation between tri-modalities by discretizing image, speech and text.
- Provide a new interpretation of modalities as languages, allowing multi-modal translation to leverage neural machine translation techniques.
- TMT model encompasses direct speech-to-image synthesis and image-to-speech captioning, which have not been well addressed before.
- TMT can be trained efficiently like text-only systems due to the unified interface and computational savings from discretization.
- TMT outperforms single-task models consistently, showing benefit of unifying multiple multi-modal tasks in one model.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework (TMT) to translate between tri-modalities by treating them as different languages and discretizing the modalities. This allows leveraging neural machine translation techniques for efficient multi-modal learning using a single model.
