# [Identification of Knowledge Neurons in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural language models like transformers have become very powerful for learning representations, but lack interpretability. This is especially concerning for high-stakes domains like computational biology where trust in predictions is crucial. 
- Specifically, for protein language models like ESM, it is unclear which components contribute most to predictions, decreasing trust.

Proposed Solution:  
- Identify and analyze "knowledge neurons" in ESM - components that capture key information for predictions. 
- Evaluate two methods to label neurons as knowledge-expressing:
   - Activation-based: Preserve high activation magnitude neurons  
   - Integrated gradients: Preserve low integrated gradient neurons
- Create submodels from selected knowledge neurons and evaluate on enzyme classification.

Key Contributions:
- Both neuron selection methods consistently outperform random baseline, successfully identifying knowledge-rich neurons.
- Especially high density of knowledge neurons found in key vector prediction networks of ESM self-attention.
- Likely because keys specialize in different input features, these neurons capture motifs indicating enzyme class.  

Impact:
- Provides first steps towards interpreting components of protein language models based on knowledge expression.
- Can guide architecture optimizations, like increasing key vector dimensionality for biological tasks.
- Caution against blind application - expert verification still needed.
- Sheds light on importance of interpretability to enhance trust and utility.

In summary, this paper makes progress on the challenge of interpreting complex protein language models by evaluating methods to identify knowledge-rich neurons. The findings pave the way towards characterizing and improving model components for critical biology applications.
