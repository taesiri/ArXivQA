# [Identification of Knowledge Neurons in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural language models like transformers have become very powerful for learning representations, but lack interpretability. This is especially concerning for high-stakes domains like computational biology where trust in predictions is crucial. 
- Specifically, for protein language models like ESM, it is unclear which components contribute most to predictions, decreasing trust.

Proposed Solution:  
- Identify and analyze "knowledge neurons" in ESM - components that capture key information for predictions. 
- Evaluate two methods to label neurons as knowledge-expressing:
   - Activation-based: Preserve high activation magnitude neurons  
   - Integrated gradients: Preserve low integrated gradient neurons
- Create submodels from selected knowledge neurons and evaluate on enzyme classification.

Key Contributions:
- Both neuron selection methods consistently outperform random baseline, successfully identifying knowledge-rich neurons.
- Especially high density of knowledge neurons found in key vector prediction networks of ESM self-attention.
- Likely because keys specialize in different input features, these neurons capture motifs indicating enzyme class.  

Impact:
- Provides first steps towards interpreting components of protein language models based on knowledge expression.
- Can guide architecture optimizations, like increasing key vector dimensionality for biological tasks.
- Caution against blind application - expert verification still needed.
- Sheds light on importance of interpretability to enhance trust and utility.

In summary, this paper makes progress on the challenge of interpreting complex protein language models by evaluating methods to identify knowledge-rich neurons. The findings pave the way towards characterizing and improving model components for critical biology applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper identifies and characterizes "knowledge neurons" in the Evolutionary Scale Model protein language model fine-tuned for enzyme sequence classification, finding that methods based on activations and integrated gradients consistently outperform random selection of neurons and that key vector prediction networks contain a high density of crucial knowledge neurons.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes and evaluates two methods, activation-based selection and integrated gradient-based selection, to identify "knowledge neurons" in the Evolutionary Scale Model (ESM) protein language model. Specifically, after fine-tuning ESM for enzyme sequence classification, these methods are used to select a subset of neurons from the original model that are predicted to express understanding of key information. The paper shows that submodels constructed from these identified knowledge neurons consistently outperform a random baseline, demonstrating that the methods can successfully locate components crucial for knowledge expression. Additionally, analysis reveals that many knowledge neurons lie in the key vector prediction networks, suggesting they capture knowledge of different enzyme sequence motifs. Overall, the paper provides a first step towards interpreting and characterizing the components of protein language models.

In summary, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing two methods to identify knowledge neurons in protein language models
2) Evaluating these methods by constructing submodels and showing performance exceeds random baseline
3) Revealing that many knowledge neurons exist in key vector prediction networks, capturing motif knowledge
4) Providing an initial framework and analysis methodology for protein language model interpretation

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two methods for identifying knowledge neurons - activation-based and integrated gradients-based selection. What are the key differences between these two methods and what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. When constructing the submodels comprised of predicted knowledge neurons, what percentage of parameters from the original model were preserved? What was the rationale behind choosing these specific percentages? 

3. The integrated gradients method requires approximating a continuous integral as a Riemann sum. What are the key considerations and potential limitations of this approximation approach? How sensitive are the results to the choice of approximation scheme?

4. Figure 1 shows that the integrated gradients method outperforms activation-based selection for the 50% and 25% submodels. However, their performance converges at 10% and 1%. What factors may explain this trend?

5. The analysis reveals high density of knowledge neurons in key vector prediction networks. What are some hypotheses for why key vectors may learn more relevant knowledge compared to query and value vectors?

6. How exactly were the heatmaps in Figures 2-4 constructed? What pre-processing steps were required before visualizing the knowledge neuron distributions? 

7. The chosen task of enzyme classification relies heavily on sequence motifs. Would we expect different distributions of knowledge neurons for tasks relying more holistically on entire sequence?

8. What steps could be taken to move beyond binary knowledge neuron classification and instead categorize the types of knowledge learned? What are the major challenges associated with this goal?

9. What biases may the ESM model encode from its training data and objectives? How could these biases impact the knowledge neuron analysis and its downstream applications?

10. The paper aims to enhance model interpretability to increase trust. What additional analyses would be required before confidently applying these protein embeddings in real-world therapeutic applications?
