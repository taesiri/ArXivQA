# Code Prompting: a Neural Symbolic Method for Complex Reasoning in Large   Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses that this paper explores are:1. Can prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate code, rather than natural language rationales, enhance their reasoning and problem-solving abilities? 2. Specifically, can "code prompting" in which LLMs are guided to first generate task-specific code, and then follow that code to solve problems, improve performance on complex reasoning tasks compared to existing prompting methods like chain-of-thought (CoT)?3. What are the potential benefits of using symbolic, unambiguous code over natural language rationales to guide LLM reasoning? Does code act as a more structured "mind map" or template? 4. What are some limitations or downsides to code prompting compared to CoT or other prompting methods? When does it struggle or fail?5. Can code prompting and CoT prompting be effectively combined in an ensemble model to get the best of both methods?6. How do factors like code annotations and their location affect the performance of code prompting?In summary, the central hypotheses are that code prompting can enhance LLM reasoning over natural language prompting alone, due to benefits like task structure and disambiguation, but it may also have some limitations. The paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of code prompting through extensive experiments and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Introducing code prompting, a neural-symbolic prompting method that guides large language models (LLMs) to first generate code to solve a reasoning task before producing the final answer. This method has both zero-shot and few-shot versions.2. Evaluating code prompting on 7 benchmark datasets for symbolic reasoning (last letter concatenation, coin flip) and arithmetic reasoning (SingleEq, AddSub, MultiArith, SVAMP, GSM8K). The results show code prompting generally outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, especially in more complex symbolic reasoning tasks. 3. Conducting extensive ablation studies and error analyses to gain insights into code prompting. The studies analyze the effects of different components like self-debugging, annotations, equation instructions, and irrelevant information handling. The error analyses reveal pros and cons of code vs. CoT prompting.4. Proposing an ensemble method that combines CoT and code prompting through voting, achieving significantly higher accuracy. This demonstrates the complementary strengths of natural language and code for reasoning.5. Analyzing the effects of code annotations and their locations, finding that annotations tend to help more on harder problems and work better at the end of code lines.Overall, the introduction and thorough evaluation of code prompting on reasoning tasks is the main contribution, demonstrating the promise of neural-symbolic methods that combine natural language models with formal representations like code. The analyses also provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different reasoning approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces a new prompting method called code prompting, which guides large language models to first generate code to solve a reasoning problem before outputting the final answer. The key idea is that code acts as an unambiguous and executable intermediate representation that facilitates complex reasoning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related work:- It builds on recent work exploring the use of programs/code to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such as PAL, Binder, and POT. The key distinction is the focus on code prompting specifically.- Compared to PAL, it digs deeper into code prompting with both zero-shot and few-shot versions. It shows zero-shot code prompting can match or exceed PAL on arithmetic tasks. It also explores using the LLM itself in the second stage rather than just executing code externally. - The concept of using programs to assist reasoning has been explored in works like Binder and POT, but they often focus on a narrow domain like reasoning over tables. Code prompting aims to be more general-purpose.- The idea of neural-symbolic methods has been explored before, but often in a limited domain like quantity or compositional reasoning. Code prompting aims to adapt symbolic methods like code to enhance reasoning more broadly.- It explores both symbolic and arithmetic reasoning across a range of 7 standard benchmarks. Many prior works focus on just one type of reasoning or a smaller set of tasks.- It provides extensive ablation studies and error analysis to gain insights into code prompting. This helps motivate extensions like self-debugging and irrelevant info handling.- It shows combining code prompting and chain of thought prompting can improve performance, suggesting they provide complementary benefits.In summary, code prompting builds on prior work on program-assisted reasoning, but provides a thorough exploration of code specifically as a neural-symbolic method for enhancing reasoning across both symbolic and arithmetic tasks. The ablation studies and error analysis provide novel insights into the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper proposes code prompting, a neural symbolic method for eliciting reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using code as intermediate steps. Based on the experiments and analyses presented, the authors suggest several potential future research directions:1. Investigate how to filter irrelevant information before code generation by LLMs. The error analysis showed code generation can be easily distracted by irrelevant context. Further work could explore techniques to help LLMs focus only on the relevant information when generating code.2. Explore methods to better teach LLMs to solve equations in code. The experiments found LLMs struggle with encoding equations in code. Future research could develop more effective techniques to instruct LLMs to leverage Python packages like sympy to handle equations in a robust way. 3. Study the gap between zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods as LLMs develop in scale and alignment with humans. The paper showed zero-shot code prompting can be competitive with few-shot methods, but the reasons are still unclear. Further investigation into the capabilities of different prompting techniques is suggested.4. Consider combining code prompting with other methods like chain-of-thought prompting, as the analysis showed they lead the LLM to think from different angles. Ensemble methods that leverage diverse prompting techniques could be a promising direction.5. Analyze the effects of code annotations and locations to gain better understanding of how to effectively guide LLM code generation. The ablation studies provided initial insights into annotation design choices.6. Explore the use of code prompting for ambiguity detection by observing variety in LLM code generation. Experiments showed code prompting is more sensitive to question ambiguity compared to chain-of-thought prompting.7. Study the applicability of code prompting to broader reasoning tasks beyond the symbolic and arithmetic reasoning evaluated in the paper. Assessing the generalization capability across more diverse reasoning problems is an important direction.In summary, the main suggestions are to build on code prompting by handling its limitations, integrating it with complementary prompting techniques, further analyzing key design choices, and evaluating on a wider range of complex reasoning tasks. Advancing the understanding and capabilities of neural-symbolic methods like code prompting is highlighted as an impactful area for future work.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces code prompting, a neural-symbolic prompting method that aims to enhance complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to first prompt the LLM to generate a piece of code to solve a given reasoning question. This code acts as an explicit problem-solving template that breaks down the complex task into simpler sub-tasks that can be easily executed by the LLM. In the second stage, the LLM is prompted again to follow the generated code step-by-step to reach the final answer, printing all intermediate variables. Alternatively, the code can be executed using an external Python interpreter.The method is evaluated on symbolic reasoning tasks like last letter concatenation and coin flip, as well as arithmetic reasoning datasets. Results show that both zero-shot and few-shot code prompting outperform baselines like zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. Detailed error analysis provides insights into the advantages of using symbolic code over natural language rationales. Overall, code prompting combines the reasoning ability of neural models with the interpretability and unambiguousness of symbolic representations.
