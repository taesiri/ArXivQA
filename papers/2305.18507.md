# Code Prompting: a Neural Symbolic Method for Complex Reasoning in Large   Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses that this paper explores are:1. Can prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate code, rather than natural language rationales, enhance their reasoning and problem-solving abilities? 2. Specifically, can "code prompting" in which LLMs are guided to first generate task-specific code, and then follow that code to solve problems, improve performance on complex reasoning tasks compared to existing prompting methods like chain-of-thought (CoT)?3. What are the potential benefits of using symbolic, unambiguous code over natural language rationales to guide LLM reasoning? Does code act as a more structured "mind map" or template? 4. What are some limitations or downsides to code prompting compared to CoT or other prompting methods? When does it struggle or fail?5. Can code prompting and CoT prompting be effectively combined in an ensemble model to get the best of both methods?6. How do factors like code annotations and their location affect the performance of code prompting?In summary, the central hypotheses are that code prompting can enhance LLM reasoning over natural language prompting alone, due to benefits like task structure and disambiguation, but it may also have some limitations. The paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of code prompting through extensive experiments and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Introducing code prompting, a neural-symbolic prompting method that guides large language models (LLMs) to first generate code to solve a reasoning task before producing the final answer. This method has both zero-shot and few-shot versions.2. Evaluating code prompting on 7 benchmark datasets for symbolic reasoning (last letter concatenation, coin flip) and arithmetic reasoning (SingleEq, AddSub, MultiArith, SVAMP, GSM8K). The results show code prompting generally outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, especially in more complex symbolic reasoning tasks. 3. Conducting extensive ablation studies and error analyses to gain insights into code prompting. The studies analyze the effects of different components like self-debugging, annotations, equation instructions, and irrelevant information handling. The error analyses reveal pros and cons of code vs. CoT prompting.4. Proposing an ensemble method that combines CoT and code prompting through voting, achieving significantly higher accuracy. This demonstrates the complementary strengths of natural language and code for reasoning.5. Analyzing the effects of code annotations and their locations, finding that annotations tend to help more on harder problems and work better at the end of code lines.Overall, the introduction and thorough evaluation of code prompting on reasoning tasks is the main contribution, demonstrating the promise of neural-symbolic methods that combine natural language models with formal representations like code. The analyses also provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different reasoning approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces a new prompting method called code prompting, which guides large language models to first generate code to solve a reasoning problem before outputting the final answer. The key idea is that code acts as an unambiguous and executable intermediate representation that facilitates complex reasoning. Experiments on symbolic and arithmetic reasoning tasks show code prompting outperforms baselines like chain-of-thought prompting. The method provides insights into how to combine neural networks with symbolic representations.In one sentence: The paper proposes code prompting, using code as an intermediate step to improve reasoning in large language models.
