# [SpaceHopper: A Small-Scale Legged Robot for Exploring Low-Gravity   Celestial Bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Exploring low-gravity celestial bodies like asteroids and moons using mobile robots is valuable but challenging. Wheeled rovers struggle with loss of traction and traversing rough terrain. Alternative approaches have limitations in efficiency, mobility or ability to cover wide areas.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present SpaceHopper, a 5.2kg three-legged jumping robot designed for controlled locomotion in microgravity environments. The legs each have 3 active degrees of freedom allowing jumping and using the legs for reorienting the body attitude during flight.

- To control the robot, deep reinforcement learning policies are trained in simulation and transferred to the real system. The policies map observations like body orientation to desired joint positions that are tracked by low-level motor controllers.

Main Contributions:
- A CubeSat-sized, space-qualifiable legged robot specialized for microgravity locomotion is presented. Lightweight materials, space rated components and a differential hip drive optimized for jumping are used.

- In zero-g simulation, the robot can reorient to an upright landing configuration from random attitudes in just 1 second. This allows landing safely after long jumps.

- Using a gimbal that offloads gravity, the real robot system is tested to reorient to within 9.7 degrees accuracy, validating its capability.

- In a Ceres gravity simulation, the robot can jump 6 meters to commanded positions with only 0.3 meter average error while stabilizing its attitude, demonstrating fully integrated jumping locomotion control.  

- On hardware, repeated vertical jumps of 1.2 meters are achieved using a counterweight setup, validating the electronics, mechanics and controls for jumping.

The results represent an important milestone towards controlled legged locomotion for asteroid exploration. Future work should focus on testing the integrated jumping capability on hardware using parabolic flights.
