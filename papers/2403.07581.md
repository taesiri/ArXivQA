# [LLMvsSmall Model? Large Language Model Based Text Augmentation Enhanced   Personality Detection Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07581)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Personality detection aims to detect a person's personality traits from their social media posts. This is a challenging task due to the scarcity of ground-truth personality trait labels, which are collected from time-consuming self-report questionnaires. Existing methods that fine-tune pre-trained language models with limited labels fail to learn high-quality post representations, hurting performance. They also treat traits as one-hot labels, overlooking semantic information.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a text augmentation enhanced personality detection model that distills knowledge from a large language model (LLM) to improve a small specialized model, even when the LLM struggles on this task itself. Specifically:

1) The LLM generates post augmentations analyzing semantics, sentiments, and linguistics. Contrastive learning aligns original and augmented post embeddings, enabling better capture of psycho-linguistic information.

2) The LLM generates personality label explanations from multiple perspectives, enriching label information. Soft labels mitigate over-confidence.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of LLM to generate informative post augmentations and label explanations that alleviate data scarcity and improve the small model's detection capability.

- Specialized design of post augmentation aspects - semantic, sentiment, linguistic - which are key for personality detection. 

- Contrastive learning framework to align original and augmented post embeddings for better representations.

- Enriched label semantics and soft labels to enhance model generalization.

- State-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets demonstrates advantages over existing methods.

The core idea is to distill knowledge from the LLM's strong language modeling capability to overcome data scarcity and complexity challenges in personality detection, benefiting the small specialized model.
