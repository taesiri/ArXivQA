# [Enhanced DareFightingICE Competitions: Sound Design and AI Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing fighting game platform "DareFightingICE" (built in Java) has limitations in its audio system and ability to add new accessibility features for visually impaired players (VIPs). It is also outdated, being over 10 years old. 
- There is a lack of research and platforms focused on making fighting games more accessible for VIPs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors upgrade DareFightingICE by re-implementing it in the Unity game engine, calling it "DareFightingICE-Unity". 
- Unity provides improved 3D audio, easier ways to access and manipulate audio data, and better support for adding accessibility features. This enhances the experience for VIPs.

Main Contributions:
1. Improves the audio system and ability to add accessibility features in the platform to better support VIPs.
2. Provides more flexibility for audio research (e.g. procedural sound generation) by removing restrictions on manipulating audio within Unity. 
3. Upgrades the overall platform by leveraging modern gaming technology offered by Unity.

Additionally:
- They split the previous DareFightingICE competition into two standalone competitions focused on sound design and AI agents separately. 
- The evaluation metric for the Sound Design competition is improved to better assess performance.
- The platform maintains backwards compatibility for existing AI agents to facilitate an easy transition.

In summary, they present a significantly upgraded fighting game platform focused on accessibility for VIPs, enabled by transitioning from an outdated Java implementation to a more flexible and modern Unity-based system. This opens new possibilities for future research while retaining connections to previous work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents an upgraded fighting game platform called DareFightingICE using the Unity engine to improve the audio system, better support accessibility features for visually impaired players, and split the previous DareFightingICE competition into separate sound design and AI competitions held at the 2024 IEEE Conference on Games.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing an upgraded DareFightingICE platform in Unity that improves the overall audio system, makes it easier to add new accessibility features for visually impaired players (VIPs), and provides more flexibility for audio research compared to the previous Java-based platform. Specifically, the key contributions summarized in the paper are:

1) Overall improvement in the audio system and audio data provision for AI agents: The new Unity-based platform leverages modern 3D audio capabilities to convey better spatialized sound to players. It also centralizes audio handling to mitigate limitations of the previous platform in modifying/generating sounds.

2) More capability to add accessibility features for VIPs and conduct audio research: The Unity engine facilitates integrating latest hardware/software to support VIPs. There are also more examples and resources on procedural sound generation etc. to enable participants to explore new techniques.

3) Enhanced experience in using the platform for any purpose: The upgrade to a modern game engine improves the overall usability and audio quality when using the platform.

In summary, the main contribution is enhancing the DareFightingICE platform, especially the audio/accessibility capabilities, through an upgrade to the Unity engine to create new possibilities for serving VIPs and audio research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

1) DareFightingICE platform - The fighting game platform designed to make fighting games more accessible to visually impaired players. The paper introduces an upgraded unity version called DareFightingICE-Unity.

2) Visually impaired players (VIPs) - The target users of the DareFightingICE platform. The platform aims to make fighting games more accessible to them.  

3) Sound design - A key focus of the DareFightingICE platform is having an effective sound design to convey information to VIPs. There is a DareFightingICE Sound Design Competition focused on this.

4) AI agents - The platform supports AI agents, including "Blind AI agents" that use only audio input. There is a DareFightingICE AI Competition for these agents.

5) Accessibility - A driving motivation of the platform is to make fighting games more accessible, especially for VIPs. 

6) Performance retention ratio (PRR) - A metric used to evaluate sound designs in the Sound Design Competition. An improved version using win ratio is introduced.

7) Unity game engine - The new DareFightingICE platform introduced is built using the Unity engine, providing improved audio capabilities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions utilizing Unity's capabilities for procedural content generation to generate sound effects. Can you elaborate on how this could be implemented? What specific Unity features could be leveraged? 

2. The new PRR metric incorporates win ratio along with HP difference to evaluate sound designs. Do you think any other metrics should be included as well to better represent player performance? Why or why not?

3. The paper states that the AI interface was kept similar to ease the transition for participants. However, were there any AI interface optimizations made to take advantage of Unity's features? If not, what improvements could be made?

4. How exactly is the audio listener utilized in Unity to capture all sound playback? Does it interface directly with the sound card or is there abstraction? 

5. Since the platform now supports both mono and stereo audio, how should sound designers decide which to use for particular sound effects? What considerations should be made?

6. The paper mentions the platform makes it easier to integrate the latest hardware/software to assist visually impaired players. What cutting edge technologies could be integrated in the future?

7. What additional audio-based accessibility features beyond procedural sound could leverage the new Unity architecture? Things like audio navigation cues?

8. How will the fact that Unity is a commercial game engine rather than open source affect future enhancement and extension of the platform? 

9. The paper states most prior sound design submissions were only slight modifications to the sample. Why do you think more radical changes weren't explored previously? 

10. If you were a participant, what creative use of the new platform capabilities would you propose to develop a novel sound design? Any ideas that were not possible previously?
