# [Enhanced DareFightingICE Competitions: Sound Design and AI Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing fighting game platform "DareFightingICE" (built in Java) has limitations in its audio system and ability to add new accessibility features for visually impaired players (VIPs). It is also outdated, being over 10 years old. 
- There is a lack of research and platforms focused on making fighting games more accessible for VIPs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors upgrade DareFightingICE by re-implementing it in the Unity game engine, calling it "DareFightingICE-Unity". 
- Unity provides improved 3D audio, easier ways to access and manipulate audio data, and better support for adding accessibility features. This enhances the experience for VIPs.

Main Contributions:
1. Improves the audio system and ability to add accessibility features in the platform to better support VIPs.
2. Provides more flexibility for audio research (e.g. procedural sound generation) by removing restrictions on manipulating audio within Unity. 
3. Upgrades the overall platform by leveraging modern gaming technology offered by Unity.

Additionally:
- They split the previous DareFightingICE competition into two standalone competitions focused on sound design and AI agents separately. 
- The evaluation metric for the Sound Design competition is improved to better assess performance.
- The platform maintains backwards compatibility for existing AI agents to facilitate an easy transition.

In summary, they present a significantly upgraded fighting game platform focused on accessibility for VIPs, enabled by transitioning from an outdated Java implementation to a more flexible and modern Unity-based system. This opens new possibilities for future research while retaining connections to previous work.
