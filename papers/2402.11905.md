# [Learning to Edit: Aligning LLMs with Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning to Edit: Aligning LLMs with Knowledge Editing":

Problem:
- Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) towards specific queries, without negatively impacting performance on other unrelated inputs. However, existing methods rely predominantly on memorizing the updated knowledge rather than effectively applying it when answering questions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework to teach LLMs how to apply updated knowledge when answering questions, instead of just memorizing it. 

- The LTE framework has two main phases:
   1) Alignment Phase: Fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to equip them with three key capabilities:
      - In-Scope Capability: Generate reliable and logically consistent edits.
      - Out-of-Scope Capability: Preserve integrity of unrelated content.  
      - Linguistic Capability: Maintain high linguistic quality.
   2) Inference Phase: Employs a retrieval mechanism to obtain relevant updated knowledge from a stored memory bank for real-time, mass editing.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes new state-of-the-art in knowledge editing performance, surpassing existing methods by over 20% in terms of portability.
- Exhibits robustness in handling both batch and sequential edits, with slower rate of performance deterioration. 
- Achieves knowledge editing with minimal interference to model's capabilities on unrelated tasks.
- Combines fastest editing speeds with superior performance compared to counterparts.

In summary, the LTE framework effectively teaches LLMs to apply updated knowledge when answering questions through a two-phase alignment and inference process. It demonstrates significant improvements across multiple facets of knowledge editing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework with two phases - an Alignment Phase to teach language models how to apply updated knowledge through fine-tuning on a parallel dataset, and an Inference Phase to enable real-time knowledge editing via a retrieval mechanism - that achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge editing benchmarks while preserving locality and fluency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Learning to Edit (LTE) framework for knowledge editing of large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

1) The LTE framework has two phases - An Alignment Phase and an Inference Phase. In the Alignment Phase, the LLMs are fine-tuned on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to equip them with capabilities to make reliable in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency. In the Inference Phase, a retrieval mechanism is used to obtain relevant updated knowledge from a stored memory bank for efficient real-time editing at scale.

2) Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, LTE is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on knowledge editing benchmarks. Specifically, it surpasses existing methods substantially in terms of edit success, portability, robustness in batch/sequential editing, minimal interference on unrelated tasks, and speed.

3) Rather than just memorizing updated facts, LTE focuses on teaching LLMs to actively apply new knowledge when answering questions. This enables dynamic leveraging of edits to generate logically consistent responses.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel and superior knowledge editing framework called LTE that trains LLMs to properly utilize updates for improved editing capability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Learning to Edit (LTE) method proposed in the paper:

1. The LTE framework has two main phases - Alignment and Inference. Can you explain the purpose and key components of each phase? What capabilities and mechanisms do they enable? 

2. The paper mentions teaching language models three key capabilities - In-Scope, Out-of-Scope, and Linguistic. What does each capability entail and why is it important for effective knowledge editing?

3. Parallel dataset construction seems vital to the Alignment phase. Can you outline the structure of this dataset and the rationale behind pairing edit descriptors with corresponding in-scope and out-of-scope queries?  

4. The retrieval-based mechanism is utilized in the Inference phase. How does this facilitate batch and sequential knowledge editing? What are the advantages compared to alternative approaches?

5. The LTE prompt structure incorporates both the Updated Information and Query in a specific format. What is the significance of conditioning the query on explicit knowledge editing instructions? 

6. Can you analyze the comparative results of LTE against existing methods, especially regarding edit success, portability, robustness in batch/sequential editing and interference in general tasks?

7. The incorporation of free text query-answer pairs demonstrates enhanced linguistic capabilities. How are these synthesized and what verification mechanisms are in place?

8. What role does the threefold strategy for incorporating different numbers of edit descriptors play in balancing single edit performance and fault tolerance?

9. As highlighted in the Limitations section, how can LTE be extended to proprietary models with restricted parameter access like GPT-3 and GPT-4?

10. The LTE framework focuses predominantly on factual knowledge editing. What other dimensions like opinions, emotions etc. represent promising areas of future research?
