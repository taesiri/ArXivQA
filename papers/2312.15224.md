# [LLM-Powered Hierarchical Language Agent for Real-time Human-AI   Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15224)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in assisting humans in diverse complex tasks. However, typical LLM agents rely on invoking APIs and complex prompts, resulting in high inference latency that is unsuitable for real-time human-AI coordination scenarios like gaming. Traditional gaming AI uses smaller models or scripted policies for fast inference but lacks reasoning and interaction abilities. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Hierarchical Language Agent (HLA) for real-time human-AI coordination in an extended Overcooked gaming environment. HLA adopts a hierarchical framework with three key modules:

1) Slow Mind: A proficient LLM (GPT-3.5) for intention reasoning from vague commands and bilateral language interaction. It has two stages - intention reasoning stage and chat & assessment stage.

2) Fast Mind: A lightweight LLM that generates macro actions at a faster pace while cooperating with the Slow Mind module. It avoids suboptimal moves using an action filtering mechanism.

3) Executor: A reactive script policy that translates macro actions to atomic actions and interacts with the environment at high frequency.

Contributions:
- HLA achieves an order of magnitude faster atomic action latency compared to baselines, enabling real-time responsiveness.

- It significantly outperforms baselines in game score and interpreting complex commands, owing to the Slow Mind's strong reasoning.

- In human studies, HLA attains ~50% higher game score and is the most preferred agent and communication partner, thanks to its fast responses and consistent language interactions.

In summary, HLA combines the reasoning power of large models and real-time execution of small models in a hierarchical manner to enable effective human-AI coordination requiring fast reflexes and robust language grounding. The proposed hierarchical design and human studies provide valuable insights into developing real-world interactive agents.
