# [Beyond Gradient and Priors in Privacy Attacks: Leveraging Pooler Layer   Inputs of Language Models in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works have shown vulnerabilities in federated learning for text data, allowing private training text to be extracted from language model updates. 
- However, existing attack techniques face limitations - some require very small batch sizes (e.g. 1), while others involve heavy model modifications that are easily detectable.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces an innovative attack approach that works across varied batch sizes and has minimal model changes to stay stealthy.
- The key idea is to recover the inputs to the Pooler layer in Transformer models, which give non-averaged, per-token features.
- This is done via a 2-layer neural network reconstruction method, with minor tweaks to the Pooler layer (width, activation). 
- Recovered Pooler features give a unique continuous supervisory signal alongside gradients and language model priors during optimization.

Main Contributions:
- First work to utilize intermediate features as extra supervision for text privacy attacks.
- Pioneered adaptation of 2-layer neural network reconstruction to practical deep language models. 
- Attack consistently improves over state-of-the-art methods like LAMP across benchmarks and batch sizes, highlighting robustness.  
- Introduced use of semantic similarity metrics for improved evaluation.

In summary, the paper presents a highly challenging-to-detect text privacy attack for federated learning, which leverages reconstructed intermediate features to provide enhanced optimization signals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over previous techniques.
