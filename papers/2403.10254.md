# [Magic Tokens: Select Diverse Tokens for Multi-modal Object   Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10254)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Single-modal object re-identification (ReID) methods face challenges in maintaining robustness across complex visual scenarios due to issues like extreme illumination, fog, and low resolution. While multi-modal methods utilizing complementary modalities (e.g. RGB, NIR, TIR) help address this, they can still be affected by irrelevant backgrounds and modality gaps. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called EDITOR (Select Diverse TokEns for Multi-modal Object Re-IDentification) to select diverse and object-centric tokens from vision transformers for robust multi-modal object ReID. The main modules are:

1) Spatial-Frequency Token Selection (SFTS): Employs spatial-based and frequency-based token selection to extract object-centric tokens from each modality. Spatial selection uses multi-head self-attention while frequency selection uses discrete Haar wavelet transform.

2) Hierarchical Masked Aggregation (HMA): Aggregates selected tokens hierarchically, first within each modality and then across modalities to align and fuse features.

3) Background Consistency Constraint (BCC) and Object-Centric Feature Refinement (OCFR) losses: Additional losses to reduce background interference and refine object-centric features.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to enhance multi-modal object ReID through object-centric token selection from transformers.

2) Novel modules - SFTS for joint spatial-frequency based token selection and HMA for hierarchical feature aggregation.

3) BCC and OCFR losses to suppress background noise and improve feature discrimination.

4) State-of-the-art results on 3 multi-modal ReID benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative transformer-based framework for selecting and aggregating salient object-centric tokens across modalities to improve multi-modal object ReID robustness and performance.
