# [Stitchable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06586)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we effectively utilize off-the-shelf pretrained models from model zoos to handle diverse deployment scenarios and achieve flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposes Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Nets), a new framework to combine pretrained models from model zoos into a single elastic network that can adapt to different resource constraints. - SN-Nets work by "stitching" together different pretrained models using simple stitching layers that map activations between models. This allows dynamically switching between different sub-networks at runtime.- Provides design principles for SN-Nets like using anchors from the same model family, initializing stitching layers with least squares, stitching direction, nearest stitching, etc.- Demonstrates SN-Nets on ImageNet classification by stitching models like DeiT, Swin Transformers and ResNets. Shows a single SN-Net can match hundreds of individually trained models with 22x less training cost.- Positions SN-Nets as a new scalable deep learning paradigm that goes beyond model compression or NAS by directly harnessing model zoos for efficient model design and deployment.In summary, the key hypothesis is that model stitching can enable building elastic networks from model zoos for efficient accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, which the paper explores through the SN-Net framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Net), a new framework for developing elastic neural networks by stitching together pretrained model families from the model zoo. 2. Providing design principles and effective training strategies for SN-Net, such as using simple 1x1 convolutions for stitching layers, a nearest stitching strategy, and sliding window stitching.3. Demonstrating through experiments on ImageNet classification that SN-Net can achieve flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs with low training cost by stitching together variants of models like DeiT and Swin Transformer.4. Showing SN-Net works for stitching both convolutional and transformer-based models. 5. Positioning SN-Net as a novel paradigm compared to prior work on model compression and neural architecture search, enabling reuse of off-the-shelf pretrained models for efficient model deployment.In summary, the main novelty seems to be proposing SN-Net as a new approach to assemble pretrained model families to obtain a single scalable network that supports diverse deployment scenarios, with design principles and training strategies tailored for this goal. The experiments then demonstrate its capabilities and advantages over alternative methods.
