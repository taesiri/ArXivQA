# [Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification   Models and Saliency Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to visualize and understand the internal representations learned by deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) for image classification. Specifically, the authors propose and investigate two visualization techniques:1. Generating representative images that maximize the score of a particular class, in order to visualize what a ConvNet has learned about that class. 2. Computing class saliency maps that highlight the spatial support for a particular class in a given image, using the gradient of the class score. This provides a way to understand which parts of the image are most relevant for the ConvNet's classification.The authors also show that the class saliency maps can be used for weakly supervised object segmentation, without having to train dedicated segmentation models. Finally, they establish connections between their gradient-based visualization methods and prior work on deconvolutional networks, showing that their techniques generalize these approaches.In summary, this paper focuses on opening up the black box of deep ConvNets through visualization, in order to gain insights into what these models learn and how they represent images for classification. The key hypotheses are that gradient-based visualization can reveal the notions of classes captured by ConvNets, and that class saliency maps can localize objects despite only being trained on image labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:1. Demonstrating that visually understandable representations of convolutional neural network (CNN) class models can be obtained through numerical optimization of the input image. This allows visualizing the notion of a class captured by a CNN.2. Proposing a method to compute class saliency maps that highlight discriminative regions for a given class in a given image using a single backpropagation pass through the CNN. This allows weakly supervised object localization without additional annotations. 3. Establishing connections between gradient-based CNN visualization methods like the ones proposed and the deconvolutional network method. Showing gradient-based methods generalize deconvolutional networks.In summary, the paper introduces two methods to visualize and interpret CNN models and shows how one method can be used for weakly supervised localization. It also connects these gradient-based methods to prior work on deconvolutional networks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes and evaluates two visualization techniques for understanding image classification ConvNets - generating representative artificial images for each class, and computing saliency maps highlighting discriminative regions for a given image and class.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions to the field of visualizing and understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification:- It demonstrates how optimization techniques can be used to generate synthetic images that represent a CNN's learned notion of different object classes. This builds on prior work using similar techniques for visualizing unsupervised models like deep belief networks. - It introduces a method to compute class saliency maps that highlight which parts of a given image are most relevant to predicting a certain class. This provides an intuitive visualization of a CNN's reasoning and can enable applications like weakly supervised localization.- It establishes connections between gradient-based visualization methods like the class saliency maps and prior work on deconvolutional networks. This helps unify these approaches under the common framework of computing gradients and backpropagating through the network.- It provides visualizations on CNNs trained at much larger scale than prior work, using the challenging ImageNet dataset. This demonstrates the applicability of these methods to complex, state-of-the-art models.Overall, this paper significantly expanded the understanding of CNN visualizations and their capabilities. The class model optimization and saliency map techniques are now widely used for CNN interpretation. The analysis relating these methods to deconvolution networks also helped connect ideas in the field. Subsequent work has built on these contributions to develop improved or new visualization approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Incorporating the image-specific saliency maps into learning formulations more systematically, rather than just using them for initialization as done in this paper. They suggest this could be done in a more principled manner.- Exploring other ways to visualize and understand the notions learned inside deep convolutional networks beyond the gradient-based methods presented. - Applying the visualization techniques to other tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The class saliency maps seem particularly promising for guiding weakly supervised learning in these areas.- Extending the visualization approaches to other types of deep neural networks beyond convolutional networks, such as recurrent nets for sequence modeling. - Using the insights provided by the visualizations to improve model architectures, loss functions, and other aspects of convolutional network training.Overall, the authors suggest that the visualization techniques could have broad applicability for understanding, diagnosing, and improving deep learning models across various domains. Turning the techniques into more integral parts of model training and evaluation seems like a particularly interesting direction.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents two visualization techniques for deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) trained on image classification. The first technique generates an artificial image that represents a class learned by the ConvNet. The second computes a class saliency map for a given image that highlights areas discriminative for a given class. The authors show these saliency maps can be used for weakly supervised object segmentation using graph cuts, without needing dedicated segmentation or detection models. They also demonstrate that gradient-based visualization generalizes deconvolutional network reconstruction. Overall, the paper introduces accessible visualization techniques to understand what ConvNets learn for image classification and how to extract spatial support for classes in given images.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents two methods for visualizing and understanding image classification models learned by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first method generates an artificial image that represents a class of interest by optimizing the input image to maximize the class score. This visualizes the notion of the class captured by the ConvNet. The second method computes a class saliency map for a given image, highlighting areas that are most discriminative for the class. This can be used for weakly supervised object localization without additional training. The authors first demonstrate class model visualization, generating images that represent the appearance models learned by a ConvNet trained on ImageNet. They then present a method to compute image-specific class saliency maps using the gradient of the class score. These saliency maps localize objects in images and can be used to initialize graph cut segmentation. Finally, the connection is made between gradient-based ConvNet visualization methods and deconvolutional networks. It is shown that deconvolution reconstructs approximations of feature maps using operations equivalent to gradient backpropagation. Thus gradient methods generalize deconvolutional visualization.
