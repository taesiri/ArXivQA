# GLM-Dialog: Noise-tolerant Pre-training for Knowledge-grounded Dialogue   Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we develop robust knowledge-grounded dialogue capabilities for large language models (LLMs) in languages other than English that have limited high-quality dialogue datasets available?The key points are:- The paper focuses on building knowledge-grounded dialogue abilities for LLMs in languages besides English. Many recent state-of-the-art dialogue models like LaMDA, GODEL, and Blenderbot 3 have been developed for English using ample high-quality datasets. - However, for other languages like Chinese, there is a lack of large-scale high-quality dialogue datasets to support developing such models. This poses challenges in effectively grounding LLMs in knowledge to generate informative responses.- The paper specifically examines techniques to handle limited training data and noisy knowledge retrieval results. It proposes methods to augment limited datasets and train models to exploit helpful knowledge while ignoring unhelpful or incorrect external information.- The overall goal is developing methods to create robust knowledge-grounded dialogue models for languages other than English given the constrained data resources. The paper uses Chinese as a case study for their techniques.In summary, the core research question is how to develop knowledge-grounded conversational abilities for LLMs in low-resource languages by handling limited data and noisy knowledge effectively. The paper addresses this through data augmentation, training strategies, and model architectures tailored for this constrained setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The key contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Introducing GLM-Dialog, a 10 billion parameter large language model for knowledge-grounded dialogue generation in Chinese. 2. Presenting a series of techniques to train the model effectively with limited high-quality knowledge-grounded dialogue datasets in Chinese, including data augmentation strategies and a two-stage training process.3. Proposing a novel implicit human evaluation platform that allows comparing dialogue systems through natural conversation instead of explicit ratings.4. Releasing the trained model, source code, and additional tools like the query generator and helpful knowledge classifier to facilitate research and development of Chinese dialogue systems. 5. Demonstrating strong performance of GLM-Dialog on both automatic metrics and human evaluations compared to other Chinese dialogue systems.In summary, the main contributions appear to be developing and releasing a state-of-the-art knowledge-grounded Chinese dialogue system along with tools and resources to aid further research, while also introducing a new evaluation paradigm. The techniques presented to train such a system effectively under data constraints could be useful for developing dialogue systems in other languages as well.
