# [Framing in the Presence of Supporting Data: A Case Study in U.S.   Economic News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14224)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The mainstream media has significant influence over public opinion through its selection and framing of news coverage. However, analyzing media bias is difficult due to the lack of objective measures. This paper focuses specifically on economic news coverage, where objective measures of the economy's state do exist in the form of economic indicators. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a computational framework to analyze the selection and framing of economic news coverage by tracking how publications report on economic indicators over time. The framework captures framing at three levels of abstraction:

1) General framing of economic conditions in an article (good/bad) 
2) Which specific economic indicators are highlighted (e.g. jobs, prices)
3) The polarity of how each indicator is presented (positive/negative/neutral)

By comparing media coverage of indicators to the ground truth values of those indicators, this framework enables analysis of how different publications may spin coverage of the economy.

Contributions:

1) A computational framework formalizing economic news framing analysis through selection and presentation of indicators

2) A new dataset of 199k economic articles from major U.S. news outlets 2015-2023

3) Human annotations of general framing, highlighted indicators, and polarity for a subset of articles

4) Methods utilizing statistical relational learning to predict framing components from text  

5) Analysis demonstrating shifts in coverage of jobs and prices across publications, showcasing uses of the framework to track media spin and compare outlets.

The paper makes important steps towards better understanding media framing through a data-driven analysis grounded in objective measures. The framework and dataset enable richer characterization of bias beyond traditional sentiment analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a computational framework to automatically identify how news articles portray the US economy by detecting which economic indicators are reported, how the general economic conditions are framed, and whether each indicator is presented positively or negatively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a computational framework to model framing of news articles about the US economy. Specifically, the paper:

1) Decomposes economic frames into a set of interdependent tasks to capture nuances:
- Article-level tasks to identify general framing of economic conditions and direction
- Quantity-level tasks to identify which economic indicators are highlighted and how they are framed

2) Collects a dataset of landing page news articles from major US outlets over 2015-2023 and provides annotations for a subset following the proposed framing schema 

3) Proposes an automated method to detect the different frame components under low supervision by using statistical relational learning to exploit inter-dependencies and pre-training strategies to leverage unlabeled in-domain data

4) Demonstrates how the framework can be used to analyze selection and framing choices related to economic indicators by different news outlets over time, using the values of the indicators as a ground truth to compare against.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a computational framework to model nuanced aspects of economic news framing in the presence of supporting data indicators, in order to enable analysis of media bias.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Framing analysis - The paper focuses on developing a computational framework for modeling news framing, specifically in the context of economic news. 

- Economic indicators - The paper leverages economic indicators like jobs numbers, GDP, inflation, etc. as objective measures to evaluate media framing choices.

- Selection and framing - The paper discusses media selection (choice of what topics to cover) and framing (how the topics are portrayed) as key editorial choices that shape public perception.

- Ground truth - Economic indicators provide a "ground truth" that media portrayals can be compared against to identify biases.

- Interdependent tasks - The paper models framing prediction as a set of interdependent sub-tasks at the article and quantity levels. 

- Relational learning - Statistical relational learning methods are used to model the relationships and dependencies between the framing sub-tasks.

- Low supervision - The goal is to predict frames accurately even with limited labeled training data.

- Tracking framing over time - The framework enables analyzing how media outlets' framing of economic issues shifts over time.

- Comparing publications - The framework allows comparing selection and framing between different publications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a computational framework to model framing in the presence of supporting data. How does this framework differ from previous computational approaches to analyze media framing? What specific limitations does it aim to address?

2. One of the key ideas is to decompose economic frames into interdependent subtasks. What are the article-level and quantity-level subtasks? How do you ensure that the dependencies between them are properly modeled?

3. Statistical relational learning methods like Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) are used to model the interdependencies between different frame components. Why is a relational modeling approach suitable for this task? What are some of the relational rules encoded in the PSL model?

4. Pre-trained language models like RoBERTa are used to enhance the priors in the PSL model. What is the intuition behind combining neural methods with statistical relational learning? How does domain-adaptive pre-training help in this setup? 

5. The paper demonstrates tracking framing and selection choices for different news outlets regarding economic indicators like jobs numbers and prices over time. What insights do the preliminary analyses reveal about differences in coverage across publishers?

6. One limitation acknowledged is the expense of obtaining high-quality annotations for the proposed frame structure. What strategies are suggested to address this and scale up annotations? How can semi-supervised learning approaches help?

7. The quantity-level predictions seem more reliable than article-level predictions in the experiments. What could be the reasons behind this? How can the model be improved to make better article-level judgments?

8. How suitable is the proposed framework for analyzing framing in other topics that have standardized indicators as ground truth data, like crime or climate change? What adaptations would be required?

9. The paper tracks six mainstream American publishers. How could the analysis be extended to incorporate a wider range of media outlets internationally? What challenges might arise?

10. What are some possible negative societal impacts that could result from large-scale computational analysis of media frames? Should certain ethical precautions and safeguards be considered?
