## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recognizing handwritten Bangla characters is challenging due to the cursive nature of Bangla script and presence of complex shaped compound characters with multiple ways of writing. 
- Existing methods have focused only on subsets of Bangla characters (e.g. basic characters, compound characters, digits) rather than all types.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes BanglaNet, an ensembled Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying Bangla basic characters, compound characters, numerals and modifiers. 
- Three different CNN models (A, B and C) inspired by Inception, ResNet and DenseNet architectures are developed. 
- The models are trained on augmented and non-augmented variants of three Bangla handwritten character datasets: CMATERdb, BanglaLekha-Isolated and Ekush.
- The predictions from all 6 models are ensembled to get the final classifications.

Main Contributions:
- BanglaNet model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all three datasets, outperforming previous CNN-based methods.
- It obtains 98.4%, 97.65% and 97.32% top-1 test accuracy on CMATERdb, BanglaLekha-Isolated and Ekush datasets respectively.
- The ensemble approach leads to lower loss and higher accuracy compared to the individual models.
- The model is comprehensive in its ability to classify all major types of Bangla characters unlike prior work.
- Detailed analyses of precision, recall, F1 scores further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution.

In summary, the paper makes contributions in developing an accurate and unified Bangla handwritten character recognition system based on an ensembled CNN architecture. The comprehensive empirical evaluations showcase state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of an ensembled deep convolutional neural network model called "BanglaNet" for recognizing handwritten Bangla characters. The model ensembles three CNNs based on Inception, ResNet, and DenseNet architectures. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three Bangla handwritten character datasets - CMATERdb, BanglaLekha Isolated, and Ekush. The model is able to recognize various types of Bangla characters including basic characters, compound characters, numerals and modifiers. A key novelty is the ensembling of diverse CNN models to improve recognition performance compared to individual models. The accuracy results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BanglaNet model.

In summary, the main contribution is an ensembled CNN architecture that pushes the state-of-the-art in handwritten Bangla character recognition across multiple datasets.
