# [Alpha-wolves and Alpha-mammals: Exploring Dictionary Attacks on Iris   Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12047)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores vulnerabilities of iris recognition systems to dictionary attacks at the iris template (IrisCode) level. A dictionary attack in biometrics involves strategically creating a small number of synthetic biometric samples (templates) that can fortuitously match with a large number of identities in the database. While fingerprint and face recognition systems have been shown vulnerable to such attacks, this paper is the first to analyze the feasibility of dictionary attacks on iris recognition systems.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose two strategies to create effective dictionary attacks on iris systems by mixing the IrisCodes of different users:

1) Alpha-wolves: Select and combine the IrisCodes of users exhibiting wolf-like behaviour (users that falsely match several other users - known as "wolves" in biometrics). The mixing is done using AND, OR, XOR bitwise operators.

2) Alpha-mammals: Use a search optimization strategy to find the best IrisCodes to mix, with or without the presence of wolves. The search optimizes a coverage measure to select IrisCodes that can match the highest number of identities when mixed.

The resulting mixed templates are called alpha-mixtures. Their effectiveness as dictionary attacks is evaluated by matching them against unused IrisCodes and measuring the proportion of identities they can falsely match.

Contributions:

- Conduct the first vulnerability analysis of iris recognition systems against dictionary attacks at the IrisCode level

- Propose two strategies to create effective alpha-mixtures - alpha-wolves and alpha-mammals

- Achieve high user coverage in dictionary attacks using alpha-mixtures on multiple datasets (e.g. 71 identities @ 0.001% FMR for alpha-wolves) 

- Show alpha-wolves found using different encoding schemes (LG, QSW features) can cross-match identities encoded with the other scheme

- Demonstrate the viability of alpha-mixtures at the image level via an image translation network

- Reveal that strategically mixing IrisCodes using simple bitwise operators can result in highly effective dictionary attacks, increasing the risk of iris recognition systems.

In summary, the paper provides the first demonstration of the vulnerability of iris recognition systems to dictionary attacks at the template level, revealing a severe security threat that needs to be addressed.
