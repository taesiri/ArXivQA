# [EXPLORER: Exploration-guided Reasoning for Textual Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10692)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-based games (TBGs) have emerged as important AI environments requiring agents to combine natural language understanding with sequential decision making and reasoning. 
- Existing approaches have limitations - rule-based agents are not flexible/adaptable enough while neural agents require large amounts of training data and fail to generalize to unseen entities.  
- There is a need for an agent that can learn interpretable and transferable policies while performing well on both seen and unseen objects.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EXPLORER, a neuro-symbolic agent with a neural module for exploration and a symbolic module for exploitation.  
- The symbolic module learns declarative logic rules using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) based on the agent's experience.
- A novel information gain based algorithm is used to generalize the learned rules using WordNet, allowing the agent to reason about unseen entities.  
- Exceptions to rules are learned online to support non-monotonic reasoning as agent's beliefs can change with new observations.
- Neural module is used as a fallback when no symbolic rules are available. The overall architecture is scalable and different neural models can be plugged in.

Key Contributions:
- Novel neuro-symbolic architecture for textual RL that outperforms state-of-the-art neural and neuro-symbolic baselines on TextWorld games
- Demonstrates the importance of non-monotonic reasoning and learning exception rules in partially observable environments
- Introduces a rule generalization technique using WordNet that allows better generalization to unseen entities 
- Shows the agent can learn interpretable and human-readable policies that provide insights into its behavior
- Scalable design that allows integrating different neural modules for exploration

In summary, the paper presents a principled approach combining neural and symbolic methods for improving generalization and interpretability of RL agents in text games.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning agent called EXPLORER for text-based games that utilizes a neural module for exploration and a symbolic module for exploitation, enabling it to learn generalized symbolic policies, reason with commonsense knowledge over unseen entities, and outperform baseline neural and neuro-symbolic agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It presents EXPLORER, a neuro-symbolic agent for text-based games that outperforms existing models in terms of steps taken and scores achieved. 

2) It discusses the importance of non-monotonic reasoning in partially observable worlds like text-based games.

3) It demonstrates how default theories with exceptions can be learned online in an incremental manner for text-based games.

4) It provides a novel information-gain based rule generalization algorithm that leverages WordNet to lift the learned symbolic policies, allowing for better generalization to unseen entities.

In summary, the key innovation is a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines neural and symbolic reasoning, where the neural module handles exploration and the symbolic module exploits learned knowledge. This allows EXPLORER to achieve better performance and generalization than neural-only or symbolic-only agents.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic agent called EXPLORER. What are the key components of this architecture and how do they collaborate to make decisions? Can you walk through an example?

2. One of the key ideas proposed is using a neural module for exploration and a symbolic module for exploitation. Why is this division of labor beneficial? What challenges does it help address?

3. The paper talks about learning symbolic policies using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). How exactly does EXPLORER collect and prepare the data to apply ILP? Walk through the process.

4. EXPLORER learns exceptions to default rules using negation as failure. Can you explain how this process of exception learning allows the agent to update its beliefs in a non-monotonic fashion? 

5. The paper proposes an information gain based algorithm for rule generalization using WordNet. What is the intuition behind this method and how does it determine the optimal level of generalization?

6. What evaluation metrics are used to compare EXPLORER against baseline models? What do the results show about the agent's ability to generalize? Can you analyze the key factors behind its improved performance?

7. The paper demonstrates EXPLORER's scalability by using different neural modules as its base. How does replacing the neural module impact overall performance? What does this flexibility allow?

8. One of the goals is to generate interpretable policies. How does Answer Set Programming and the overall neuro-symbolic approach lend itself better to interpretability compared to end-to-end neural models?

9. What are some limitations of the proposed approach? How might the switching strategy between neural and symbolic modules be further optimized? 

10. The paper argues these methods mitigate ethical risks associated with neural models. Do you agree? What beneficial properties does the neuro-symbolic approach have regarding transparency and oversight?
