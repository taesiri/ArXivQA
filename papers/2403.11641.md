# [Arc2Face: A Foundation Model of Human Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11641)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating photo-realistic and identity-consistent facial images of arbitrary people is challenging. Prior GAN and text-to-image diffusion models struggle with identity retention during image manipulation or generation from text descriptions alone.  

- Existing datasets like FFHQ lack diversity to capture intra-class variation needed for robust facial generation. Models trained on such datasets fail to produce consistent identities from facial recognition (FR) features.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned facial image foundation model based on Stable Diffusion. 

- It is conditioned solely on ArcFace identity embeddings extracted from a face recognition network, without any text or spatial constraints.

- To enable training, the authors use GFPGAN to upsample 42M images from the WebFace42M dataset (largest public FR dataset) to 448x448 resolution.

- The model fine-tunes Stable Diffusion on these restored WebFace images to learn a strong facial prior, followed by further fine-tuning on FFHQ and CelebA-HQ for enhanced quality.

- For conditioning, ArcFace features are fed into the text encoder using a fixed prompt to project them into the CLIP latent space. Extensive fine-tuning tailors the encoder to ArcFace features, disregarding language guidance.

Main Contributions:

- First identity-conditioned facial foundation model with state-of-the-art identity retention performance.

- Demonstrates the necessity of large-scale FR datasets with high intra-class variation for robust face generation compared to datasets like FFHQ.

- Achieves higher similarity, diversity and realism compared to recent open-source models that also use ID conditioning, evaluated both quantitatively and via a user study.

- Can generate synthetic facial datasets for training highly performant face recognition models, outperforming existing synthetic datasets.

- Establishes ArcFace features as a compact yet powerful conditional prior for controlled face generation, without any text or spatial constraints.

In summary, the paper introduces an identity-conditioned facial foundation model achieving superior consistency by using ArcFace embeddings to guide the image generation process, trained on a carefully constructed large-scale dataset.
