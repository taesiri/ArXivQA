# [Stellar: Systematic Evaluation of Human-Centric Personalized   Text-to-Image Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06116)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on personalized text-to-image generation, where the goal is to generate images depicting a specific person in imaginary situations described by text prompts. The authors identify two key limitations in existing research: (1) a lack of large-scale standardized datasets tailored for evaluating personalized text-to-image models, and (2) a lack of rigorous evaluation protocols that capture important aspects like preservation of personal identity and faithfulness to textual descriptions. To address these gaps, the paper introduces the Stellar dataset containing 20,000 personalized prompts grounded on 400 distinct identities, along with a set of specialized evaluation metrics for assessing identity preservation, attribute consistency, object grounding accuracy, etc. The authors further propose StellarNet, a new baseline model building on top of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like SDXL. Both human evaluation trials and quantitative experiments using the new dataset and metrics show StellarNet achieves much better personalization performance compared to previous approaches like DreamBooth and ELITE. The introduced dataset and metrics enable more systematic progress on this problem. The authors also discuss ethical considerations around potential misuse of personalized text-to-image models.
