# [Adversarial purification for no-reference image-quality metrics:   applicability study and new methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are important for evaluating image processing algorithms, but recent works have shown they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Defending IQA metrics against attacks is an open research problem. 

- This paper focuses on investigating preprocessing-based "purification" defenses against adversarial attacks on no-reference IQA metrics. The goal is to neutralize the attack's effect on the metric score while preserving visual quality and metric value correlation.

Methods
- The authors generate a dataset of adversarial images for 3 no-reference metrics using 10 attack methods from prior works. Defenses evaluated include resizing, JPEG compression, spatial transforms, filtering, diffusion models, and a proposed FCN filter. 

- Defenses are analyzed on their ability to: 1) reduce the attack's effect on metric scores ("Gain score"), 2) preserve visual quality (PSNR, SSIM), and 3) maintain correlation between original and purified metric values.

Results
- Simple transforms like flipping offer the best Gain score by altering the attack's spatial configuration but reduce visual quality. Diffusion model DiffPure performs well across all criteria.

- Proposed DiffPure variants with unsharp masking or edge blending achieve top quality scores and metric value correlation while effectively reducing attacks' impact.

- The FCN filter proposed for the AdvCF color attack achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating this attack across all metrics.

Conclusion
- Empirical defenses can effectively mitigate adversarial attacks on IQA metrics but face a never-ending arms race. Developing provable defenses is an important direction for future work toward creating robust IQA metrics.
