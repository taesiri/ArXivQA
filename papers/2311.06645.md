# [An Integrated Transportation Distance Between Kernels and Approximate   Dynamic Risk Evaluation in Markov Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06645)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers approximating solutions to forward-backward systems, where the forward part is a discrete-time Markov process described by a sequence of kernels (transition probabilities). 
- The backward part calculates risk measures or optimal stopping values in a nonlinear way based on the forward kernels. Evaluating these nonlinear backward recursions is numerically challenging.
- The goal is to develop a method to approximate the original kernels with simpler kernels to facilitate computation, while providing guarantees on the approximation error.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a transportation distance between kernels based on integrating the Wasserstein distances between conditional distributions. Properties are provided, including it being a metric.
- An iterative method is proposed to construct approximate kernels. At each timestep, an approximate kernel is built to be close to the original per the integrated transportation distance. 
- Error bounds are derived on the accuracy of the approximate backward evaluation that depend on the kernel approximation errors.
- A specialized method is given for finite support approximate kernels, with linear programming models to minimize the approximation errors.

Main Contributions:
- Definition and analysis of integrated transportation distance between kernels
- General approximation framework for forward-backward Markov systems
- Error bounds relating kernel approximation errors to backward evaluation accuracy
- Implementable method using particle approximations and linear programming for finite state systems
- Numerical illustration pricing American basket options, demonstrating computational gains

In summary, the paper provides a novel kernel approximation approach along with error bounds for discrete-time Markov systems, with an application to evaluating dynamic risk measures and optimal stopping problems. The methodology is demonstrated to be effective numerically for pricing financial derivatives.
