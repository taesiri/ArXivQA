# [Quantifying white matter hyperintensity and brain volumes in   heterogeneous clinical and low-field portable MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05119)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents WMH-SynthSeg, a new deep learning method for segmenting white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and 36 brain regions from MRI scans of any resolution or contrast, including low-field portable MRI. WMH-SynthSeg uses synthetic training data generation and domain randomization to achieve robustness to variations in image quality. Compared to prior methods like SAMSEG and LST-LPA, WMH-SynthSeg achieves higher Dice similarity coefficients for segmenting both anatomy (0.85) and WMH (0.62) across several datasets. A key innovation is imposing a data-driven constraint on the WMH intensity distribution during training to improve differentiation from white matter. Experiments demonstrate accurate segmentation of high-field and portable MRI scans, with strong volumetric correlations between estimated WMH (ρ=.85) and hippocampal volumes (ρ=.89) at both fields. The method enables large-scale standardized quantification of atrophy and white matter disease burden across diverse MRI acquisitions. WMH-SynthSeg is publicly available in FreeSurfer for translational neuroimaging research.
