# [A New Perspective On Denoising Based On Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08135)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new perspective on the classical statistical problem of denoising an observation $Z$ to estimate an underlying latent variable $\Theta$. Rather than using the traditional Bayes estimator which can over-shrink $Z$, the authors formulate an optimal transport (OT) based approach that finds a map $\delta^*(Z)$ which minimizes the Bayes risk while reproducing the original distribution of $\Theta$. Under mild assumptions, they show $\delta^*$ is well-defined and connected to solutions of a Monge OT problem. Further, by using a relaxation akin to multimarginal OT, $\delta^*$ can be recovered without explicit knowledge of the prior distribution $G^*$ of $\Theta$, using only the marginal distribution of $Z$ and posterior mean. For exponential family models, Tweedie's formula allows estimating the posterior mean directly from $Z$, enabling implementation. Overall, the paper provides mathematical foundations and OT-inspired relaxations to develop improved estimators for latent variable models across statistics and machine learning.
