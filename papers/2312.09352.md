# [PBES: PCA Based Exemplar Sampling Algorithm for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on continual learning (CL), where models are trained on a stream of data rather than a static batch. This causes catastrophic forgetting (CF) as new data changes the distribution and the model forgets past knowledge.
- Existing CL methods perform poorly on complex datasets with high diversity like sports images. Such data has large inter-class gaps and outliers. 
- Another issue is class imbalance in the datasets. This causes some classes to be underrepresented when sampling exemplars from past data.

Proposed Solution:  
- A new sampling algorithm called PBES is proposed to select representative exemplars robust to outliers. It projects data along principal components and picks median points.
- To handle class imbalance, the KeepAugment data augmentation method is used to balance the classes. 
- These are coupled with distillation and cross-entropy loss for model training.

Experiments:
- PBES with KeepAugment is evaluated on Sports-100, Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets.
- It outperforms state of the art methods like iCaRL, Rainbow Memory and GDUMB in accuracy and F1 score. 
- Ablation studies validate benefits of both PBES sampling and KeepAugment balancing.

Main Contributions:
- A PCA and median point based sampling algorithm PBES that handles outliers well
- Mitigating class imbalance for continual learning via data augmentation
- Evaluation on complex sports image datasets showing improved performance over existing methods

In summary, the paper proposes a new exemplar sampling method and data augmentation approach to make continual learning robust to outliers and class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate state of the art results on challenging datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel exemplar selection approach for continual learning based on PCA and median sampling that handles outliers well, and combines it with a data augmentation method to mitigate class imbalance, demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on complex image datasets including sports images which have high diversity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes the following main contributions:

1. It proposes a novel sampling algorithm called PBES (PCA Based Exemplar Sampling) to select representative exemplars from incoming training data in order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. This algorithm is robust to outliers in the data.

2. It presents an approach to handle class imbalance in continual learning by using the KeepAugment data augmentation method to balance the training data. 

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including both the PBES sampling algorithm and the data augmentation method, on complex image datasets like Sports100, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR100. The results show improved performance over state-of-the-art continual learning methods on these datasets.

So in summary, the main contribution is a new exemplar sampling technique coupled with a data augmentation method to enable better continual learning, especially on complex and imbalanced image datasets. The approach is shown to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.

The paper proposes a new exemplar sampling method called PBES that is based on principal component analysis and median point sampling. This sampling method is used to select representative exemplars from previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning settings. The paper also utilizes the KeepAugment data augmentation method to handle class imbalance. Experiments are conducted on sports image datasets like Sports100 which have high intra-class variance. The proposed approach combines PBES sampling, KeepAugment and cross-distillation loss and shows better performance than existing methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel sampling algorithm called PBES to select exemplars for continual learning. How does PBES sampling work? What is the intuition behind using PCA projections and median point selection?

2. The paper argues that PBES sampling is more robust to outliers compared to prior exemplar selection techniques like herding. Why would sampling based on medians along PCA directions be less sensitive to outliers than herding?

3. The paper applies PBES sampling in a rehearsal-based continual learning system. Walk through the full training process when a new task arrives - what losses are computed, how is the model updated, what data is used and how? 

4. KeepAugment data augmentation is used along with PBES sampling. Explain the KeepAugment algorithm and how it helps create balanced training sets from imbalanced data streams in continual learning. 

5. Ablation studies compare PBES to herding sampling. What performance metrics are reported and how much does PBES improve over herding? Also discuss the impact of exemplar memory size.

6. The Sports100 dataset used in experiments has high inter-class variance. How does the intra-class variance of Sports100 compare with CIFAR100? Why is high intra-class variance also challenging for continual learning?

7. The paper argues PBES sampling makes the method robust when there is large data variance. Intuitively explain why large variance could be problematic for techniques like herding.  

8. How many components does the overall continual learning system in the paper have? Explain the role of each component.

9. What are the two loss functions used for model training? Write out their mathematical formulations and explain how they help mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

10. The paper demonstrates PBES sampling and KeepAugment work well together. Speculate on some ways their strengths could complement each other during continual learning.
