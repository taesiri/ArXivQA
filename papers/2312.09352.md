# [PBES: PCA Based Exemplar Sampling Algorithm for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on continual learning (CL), where models are trained on a stream of data rather than a static batch. This causes catastrophic forgetting (CF) as new data changes the distribution and the model forgets past knowledge.
- Existing CL methods perform poorly on complex datasets with high diversity like sports images. Such data has large inter-class gaps and outliers. 
- Another issue is class imbalance in the datasets. This causes some classes to be underrepresented when sampling exemplars from past data.

Proposed Solution:  
- A new sampling algorithm called PBES is proposed to select representative exemplars robust to outliers. It projects data along principal components and picks median points.
- To handle class imbalance, the KeepAugment data augmentation method is used to balance the classes. 
- These are coupled with distillation and cross-entropy loss for model training.

Experiments:
- PBES with KeepAugment is evaluated on Sports-100, Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets.
- It outperforms state of the art methods like iCaRL, Rainbow Memory and GDUMB in accuracy and F1 score. 
- Ablation studies validate benefits of both PBES sampling and KeepAugment balancing.

Main Contributions:
- A PCA and median point based sampling algorithm PBES that handles outliers well
- Mitigating class imbalance for continual learning via data augmentation
- Evaluation on complex sports image datasets showing improved performance over existing methods

In summary, the paper proposes a new exemplar sampling method and data augmentation approach to make continual learning robust to outliers and class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate state of the art results on challenging datasets.
