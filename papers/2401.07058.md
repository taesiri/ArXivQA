# [Does More Advice Help? The Effects of Second Opinions in AI-Assisted   Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07058)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-assisted decision making is becoming more popular, where humans collaborate with AI systems to make decisions. However, humans often rely on AI recommendations inappropriately, either under-relying or over-relying on them. This leads to suboptimal joint human-AI performance. 

- Prior work has tried interventions like providing AI explanations to improve appropriate reliance, but the effectiveness is inconclusive. The paper explores using "second opinions" as a new intervention.

Methodology:
- The authors conduct 3 pre-registered human subjects experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk using an AI-assisted movie review sentiment analysis task. 

- Experiment 1 varies whether second opinions from human peers are provided and their agreement level with the AI system's recommendations.

- Experiment 2 additionally varies whether the second opinions are claimed to be from human peers or another AI system. 

- Experiment 3 gives subjects the option to actively solicit second opinions.

Key Findings:

- Always providing peer second opinions reduces over-reliance on the AI but increases under-reliance, regardless of agreement level or claimed source.

- Actively solicited second opinions from peers can reduce over-reliance without increasing under-reliance, but only when agreement with the AI system is high.

- The impacts of second opinions depend on how they are presented (always shown vs solicitability) and their characteristics (agreement level with AI).

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates both benefits and risks of using second opinions to influence human reliance on AI recommendations.

- Shows promise of enabling solicitation of second opinions to mitigate AI over-reliance without inducing under-reliance.

- Provides design implications for properly incorporating second opinions in AI-assisted decision workflows.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

Through three pre-registered, randomized human subject experiments, the paper explores whether and how providing "second opinions" in addition to an AI model's decision recommendation may affect decision-makers' behavior and performance in AI-assisted decision-making. The key findings include:

1) Always presenting second opinions reduces decision-makers' over-reliance on AI but also increases their under-reliance on AI. This effect holds regardless of whether the second opinions are from human peers or another AI model.

2) Enabling decision-makers to actively solicit second opinions from peers has the promise to reduce over-reliance without increasing under-reliance in some cases. 

3) The paper discusses implications of using second opinions as an intervention to promote appropriate reliance on AI and highlights the potential benefits, risks, and limitations of this approach in improving human-AI collaborative decision-making.

In summary, the paper provides new empirical evidence on the nuanced impacts of second opinions in AI-assisted decision-making and sheds light on how to better utilize them to enhance human-AI collaboration.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this research include:

- AI-assisted decision making
- Human-AI collaboration 
- Appropriate reliance on AI
- Over-reliance and under-reliance on AI
- Second opinions 
- Judge-advisor system
- Advice taking
- Decision accuracy
- Confidence calibration

The paper explores how providing second opinions, in addition to AI recommendations, affects human decision makers' reliance on the AI as well their overall decision-making performance. Key concepts examined include over-reliance and under-reliance on the AI recommendations, as well as decision accuracy and confidence calibration. The research draws inspiration from literature on advice taking and judge-advisor systems in psychology. Overall, this work aims to promote more appropriate reliance on AI and improve human-AI collaborative decision making.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper manipulates two key factors related to the second opinions provided - the frequency of agreement with the AI model and the stated source of the opinions. What is the rationale behind manipulating these two factors? How do you think changing these factors influences people's perception and utilization of the second opinions?

2. The paper adopts sentiment analysis tasks for their experiments. What are some key considerations in selecting an appropriate experimental task to study the effects of second opinions in AI-assisted decision making? Would you expect to see different results if a different task was used instead?

3. The paper argues that the impacts of second opinions are not solely due to their content but also their source. What other factors related to the presentation of second opinions (e.g. interface design) could potentially moderate their effects on human decision making?  

4. The finding that second opinions helped reduce over-reliance on AI but increased under-reliance seems contradictory. What underlying psychological mechanisms could explain this result? How might these mechanisms interact?

5. The paper shows that actively soliciting second opinions from peers can mitigate over-reliance without increasing under-reliance. What specific conditions need to be met for this effect to emerge? When would you expect this approach to be less effective?  

6. What are some real-world scenarios where the option for decision makers to actively solicit second opinions would be feasible to implement? What challenges might exist in enabling this in practice?  

7. The effects of second opinions were found to not significantly differ based on their source (human vs AI). Do you think this would still hold if the AI systems providing recommendations were perceived as more or less competent than human peers?

8. The paper argues peer judgments used likely had important characteristics that made them useful for promoting appropriate reliance on AI. What might those characteristics be? How could we ensure second opinions have those characteristics?

9. How might the effects of second opinions found in this paper translate to high-stakes decision making contexts? Would similar effects emerge or not?

10. What individual differences (e.g. expertise, trust propensity) might moderate how people utilize second opinions in AI-assisted workflows? Are there certain groups more or less likely to benefit from their provision?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key finding from this paper:

By conducting three experiments, this paper shows that judiciously providing second opinions (from either humans or AIs) to decision-makers in AI-assisted decision making scenarios can help reduce over-reliance on the AI, but care should be taken to minimize increased under-reliance and detrimental impacts on other aspects of decision-making performance.
