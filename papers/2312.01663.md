# [Customize your NeRF: Adaptive Source Driven 3D Scene Editing via   Local-Global Iterative Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01663)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents CustomNeRF, a framework for adaptive source driven 3D scene editing. It proposes a unified system to enable both text-driven and image-driven editing of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The key novelty is a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme that alternates between foreground-only editing and full-scene editing. This allows accurately manipulating foreground regions while preserving background content. For image-driven editing, they also design a class-guided regularization to address inconsistency across views when using a single reference image. This regularization exploits class priors from the text-to-image model for geometrically consistent editing. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate that CustomNeRF produces precise and customized editing results under both text and image prompts. Their proposed training scheme outperforms baselines in enabling accurate editing of foreground regions while maintaining the original layout and background contents. The results show this is an effective framework for adaptive source driven editing of NeRF scenes according to user requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes CustomNeRF, a unified framework for adaptive source driven 3D scene editing that can accurately edit foreground regions according to text descriptions or reference images while preserving background content, through a Local-Global Iterative Editing scheme and class-guided regularization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents CustomNeRF, a unified framework for adaptive source driven 3D scene editing that supports both text-driven and image-driven editing. 

2. It proposes a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme to enable accurate editing of foreground regions while preserving background content. This handles the challenge of precisely locating and editing foreground regions in implicit neural scene representations.

3. It designs a class-guided regularization method that exploits general class priors in the text-to-image model to alleviate the issue of view inconsistency and the Janus problem in image-driven editing.

In summary, the key contribution is the CustomNeRF framework and associated training strategies that allow accurate and customizable editing of neural radiance fields based on either text or image prompts, while maintaining background scene layout and consistency across views.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme. Can you explain in more detail how this scheme helps to edit only the foreground while preserving the background? What are the advantages of iterating between local and global stages?

2. The paper introduces a foreground-aware NeRF that predicts an editing probability at each point in addition to color and density. What is the purpose of this additional prediction? How is it used to distinguish foreground and background regions?  

3. The class-guided regularization is used to mitigate the Janus problem in image-driven editing. Can you explain the rationale behind using only class words in the local editing stage? How do the class priors help with view consistency when editing based on a single reference image?

4. What modifications need to be made to the typical NeRF architecture and losses to enable the separate rendering of foreground and background regions? Explain the rendering equations for foreground and background.  

5. This method employs a subject-aware text-to-image diffusion model for reference image embedding. What are the advantages of this approach compared to directly using the reference image as conditioning?  

6. The paper demonstrates both text-driven and image-driven editing within a unified framework. What are the differences and connections between these two types of editing? How does the method handle both cases?

7. What are the limitations of editing neural radiance fields compared to explicit 3D representations? How does this method aim to overcome those limitations?

8. Could this method for neural scene editing be extended to video editing? What components would need to change to enable coherent video editing over time?

9. How suitable is this method for interactive or real-time editing of neural scenes? What performance optimizations could be made to enable such use cases? 

10. The editing results rely heavily on the quality and capability of the text-to-image diffusion model. How might future advances in text-to-image generation impact or improve this scene editing approach?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the task of adaptive source driven 3D scene editing, where the goal is to edit an existing neural radiance field (NeRF) scene based on either a text description or a reference image depicting the desired editing outcome. This is challenging because it requires accurately editing only the foreground regions of interest while preserving background content, and maintaining multi-view consistency when using a single reference image.

Method: 
The paper proposes CustomNeRF, a framework that can perform both text-driven and image-driven scene editing in a unified manner. A subject-aware text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model is employed to embed the visual subject from the reference image into a special token for image-driven editing. The key idea is a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) scheme that alternates between foreground-only editing to change content, and full scene editing to maintain layout and context. Additionally, a class-guided regularization leverages general class priors in the T2I model to alleviate inter-view inconsistency issues in image-driven editing.

Contributions:
- Presents the first unified framework CustomNeRF for adaptive text-/image-driven NeRF scene editing.
- Proposes a Local-Global Iterative Editing scheme to enable accurate foreground editing while preserving background.  

- Designed a class regularization method that exploits T2I priors to alleviate the multi-view inconsistency problem in image-driven editing.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in editing quality and alignment to editing prompts compared to existing baselines.

In summary, the paper tackles a new problem of adaptive neural scene editing guided by textual or visual prompts, and contributes effective solutions that allow accurate and customizable editing of real 3D scenes. The proposed CustomNeRF framework significantly advances the capability of semantic-aware neural scene manipulation.
