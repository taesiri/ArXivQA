# [Customize your NeRF: Adaptive Source Driven 3D Scene Editing via   Local-Global Iterative Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01663)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents CustomNeRF, a framework for adaptive source driven 3D scene editing. It proposes a unified system to enable both text-driven and image-driven editing of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The key novelty is a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme that alternates between foreground-only editing and full-scene editing. This allows accurately manipulating foreground regions while preserving background content. For image-driven editing, they also design a class-guided regularization to address inconsistency across views when using a single reference image. This regularization exploits class priors from the text-to-image model for geometrically consistent editing. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate that CustomNeRF produces precise and customized editing results under both text and image prompts. Their proposed training scheme outperforms baselines in enabling accurate editing of foreground regions while maintaining the original layout and background contents. The results show this is an effective framework for adaptive source driven editing of NeRF scenes according to user requirements.
