## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called NAC-TCN that enhances Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) by incorporating causal dilated neighborhood attention. The goal is to improve modeling of temporal dependencies in video tasks like emotion recognition while maintaining TCN benefits like efficient parallel computation. NAC-TCN stacks dilated causal convolutions with dilated neighborhood attention in "temporal blocks", ensuring attention only uses past context. This captures complex relationships over time better than TCNs while preventing information leakage across time. Experiments on emotion recognition datasets AffWild2, EmoReact, and AFEW-VA show NAC-TCN achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance to recurrent and transformer models using fewer parameters and computations. The improvements are more significant on larger datasets, indicating effectiveness at learning temporal representations given sufficient data. Ablations demonstrate importance of residual connections and enforcing causality for emotion tasks. Key advantages are better expressivity than TCNs and GRU/LSTMs without their drawbacks like slow training, gradient issues, and high cost. The authors conclude NAC-TCN is a computationally efficient architecture well-suited to video understanding.
