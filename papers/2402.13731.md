# [The Da Vinci Code of Large Pre-trained Language Models: Deciphering   Degenerate Knowledge Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13731)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent studies show that large pre-trained language models (PLMs) store factual knowledge, but the mechanisms of how knowledge is stored in PLMs remain unclear. 
- Prior work has identified "knowledge neurons" (KNs) that store factual knowledge, but has limitations in fully capturing the structures of how knowledge is stored.

Proposed Solution:
- Provides a comprehensive definition of "degenerate knowledge neurons" (DKNs) that covers both functional and structural aspects of how knowledge is stored. 
- Introduces a "Neurological Topology Clustering" method to more accurately identify DKNs, allowing formation of DKNs in any numbers and structures.
- Proposes a "Neuro-Degeneracy Analytic Framework" to study model robustness, evolvability and complexity through the lens of DKNs.

Key Contributions:
- Pioneers the study of structures in how factual knowledge is stored in PLMs
- Enables more accurate identification of DKNs that store factual knowledge
- Uniquely integrates analysis of model robustness, evolvability and complexity to demonstrate the critical role of DKNs through extensive experiments on 2 PLMs across 4 datasets and 6 settings
- Shows DKNs help PLMs handle input interference (robustness), efficiently learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge (evolvability), and exhibit positive correlation between degeneracy and model complexity

In summary, this paper significantly advances the understanding of how knowledge is stored in PLMs by proposing methods to uncover structural aspects of "degenerate knowledge neurons" and demonstrating their pivotal impacts on various model properties through a novel analytic framework.
