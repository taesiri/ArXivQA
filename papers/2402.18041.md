# [Datasets for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey that categorizes and summarizes the datasets associated with Large Language Models (LLMs) from five key perspectives: pre-training corpora, instruction fine-tuning datasets, preference datasets, evaluation datasets, and traditional NLP datasets. 

The paper highlights that high-quality datasets serve as the crucial foundation sustaining the growth and development of LLMs, akin to a root system nourishing a tree. However, the current landscape of LLM datasets is extensive and complex. There is a lack of systematic organization and cohesive synthesis across dataset types. This poses challenges for researchers attempting to gain a holistic understanding. 

To address this gap, the paper provides an insightful categorization and summary of 444 datasets across 8 languages spanning 32 domains. It presents distribution statistics across datasets and consolidates information related to data collection, preprocessing, usage and more. The total data size surveyed exceeds 774.5 TB for pre-training corpora and 700M instances for other datasets. 

The key contributions of the paper are three-fold:
(1) It offers the first comprehensive survey distinctly focused on collating information, statistics and analyses pertaining specifically to LLM datasets. This furnishes researchers with an integral reference encapsulating the current status and future trends.
(2) It categorizes datasets into five segments, aligning with different LLM stages - pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, preference alignment, performance evaluation and traditional NLP tasks. This structure enables better understanding of the role of each dataset type.  
(3) It identifies challenges, bottlenecks and suggestions to advance LLM datasets, facilitating standardized processes and constructive discussions to further this crucial research domain underpinning LLMs.

Overall, this survey serves as an indispensable guide for researchers and practitioners engaged in work related to LLMs and their associated datasets. The insights presented lay the groundwork for continued research, innovation and collaboration within the LLM ecosystem.
