# [A Comprehensive Evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning on   Software Engineering Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As pre-trained models (PTMs) become larger, fully fine-tuning all their parameters on downstream tasks can be very computationally expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to address this by freezing most PTM parameters and only fine-tuning a small number of additional parameters. However, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of different PEFT methods on various PTMs for software engineering tasks.

Solution:
This paper conducts an extensive empirical study evaluating 5 popular PEFT methods (Houlsby, Pfeiffer, Parallel, Prefix, LoRA) on 8 PTMs, including both text-only models like T5 and code-specific models like CodeBERT. They are evaluated on 4 representative SE tasks: clone detection, defect detection, code search and code translation. Three key research questions are explored:

1) Effectiveness of applying PEFT to text-only vs code-specific PTMs 
2) Impact of model size on PEFT performance
3) Influence of model architecture on PEFT methods

Both effectiveness (accuracy metrics) and efficiency (GPU usage, training time) are analyzed quantitatively.

Key Findings:
- Parallel PEFT method consistently performs the best overall
- PEFT more effective for transfer learning from text-only PTMs than code PTMs 
- Increasing model size hurts PEFT performance on some models 
- Encoder-decoder models better for PEFT on code search, encoder-only better for defect detection
- PEFT saves 10-30% GPU resources versus full fine-tuning
- PEFT shows potential to reduce training time but not guaranteed

Overall, the extensive experiments provide valuable insights into applying different PEFT methods on various PTMs for SE tasks. The models and code are publicly available to build upon this work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the effectiveness and efficiency of five popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods on eight pre-trained models across four software engineering downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides an empirical comparison of five popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods (Houlsby, Pfeiffer, Parallel, Prefix, LoRA) and full fine-tuning on eight pre-trained models (CodeBERT, RoBERTa, CodeT5, T5, CodeT5-large, T5-large, UniXcoder, BART) across four software engineering downstream tasks (clone detection, defect detection, code search, code translation).

2. It finds that the Parallel PEFT method overall performs the best, while LoRA performs the worst. PEFT methods achieve better performance on code search and code translation tasks compared to full fine-tuning.  

3. It shows that increasing the number of trainable parameters for certain models like T5 hurts performance of PEFT methods compared to full fine-tuning, while for others like CodeT5 it can improve performance.

4. It demonstrates that encoder-only architectures enable better PEFT performance on clone detection and defect detection tasks, while T5-based encoder-decoder architecture works better for code search task.

5. It investigates and compares the efficiency of PEFT methods in terms of GPU usage and training time. PEFT methods save 10-30% GPU resources on average compared to full fine-tuning.

In summary, it provides comprehensive analysis and evaluation of various PEFT methods on different pre-trained models across diverse software engineering tasks. The findings offer insights into strengths, weaknesses, and efficiency of different PEFT approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares the effectiveness of PEFT methods on text-only PTMs versus code-specific PTMs. Could you expand more on why PEFT methods seem to work better for transferring knowledge from text-only PTMs to code tasks compared to code-specific PTMs? 

2. For RQ2, you find that increasing the size of CodeT5 improves performance with PEFT but hurts performance for T5. What differences between the pre-training objectives and methodology of CodeT5 and T5 could explain this discrepancy?

3. The Parallel adapter method performs the best across most tasks and models. What specifically about the Parallel adapter design makes it more effective than other adapter methods like Houlsby and Pfeiffer?

4. On code search, PEFT with T5 models outperforms full fine-tuning but for CodeBERT and RoBERTa, full fine-tuning is better. Why might the T5 architecture interact positively with PEFT while BERT does not for this task?

5. You find BART has very poor performance with PEFT methods compared to T5 and BERT models. As both are encoder-decoder models, what architectural differences could explain why BART does not work well with PEFT?

6. For the code translation task, PEFT with UniXcoder actually exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning UniXcoder. What beneficial properties does UniXcoder have over other code-specific PTMs that might enable this?  

7. The efficiency experiments show Prefix tuning often requires the most GPU resources of PEFT methods. Why might adding prefix vectors be more costly than methods like adapters and LoRA?

8. There is little correlation between amount of trainable parameters of PEFT methods and training time. What other factors play a major role in determining training efficiency?

9. The results show instability in training time across tasks for the same PEFT method applied to the same model. What could be some reasons for this variability in training time?

10. If you could design a new PEFT method tailored for code tasks, what components would you focus on changing compared to current methods to try to improve efficiency and effectiveness?
