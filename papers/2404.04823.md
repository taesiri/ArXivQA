# [3D Building Reconstruction from Monocular Remote Sensing Images with   Multi-level Supervisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04823)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing monocular 3D building reconstruction methods rely on expensive fully 3D-annotated samples for supervised training, limiting their application to large-scale cross-city scenarios. However, there are large quantities of 2D building footprints available and different levels of annotated datasets that could be better utilized to reduce annotation cost.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a multi-level supervised building reconstruction network (MLS-BRN) that can flexibly utilize samples with different annotation levels - footprint only, footprint+height, footprint+offset+height - to achieve better reconstruction with less 3D annotation demand. 

Two novel modules are introduced:
1) Pseudo Building Bbox Calculator (PBC): Predicts pseudo building bboxes for samples without bbox annotations by estimating off-nadir and offset angles. This enables using bbox-unknown samples.
2) Roof-Offset guided Footprint Extractor (ROFE): Predicts footprint masks directly from predicted roof masks and offsets. This provides supervision for offset prediction in an end-to-end manner.

New tasks and training strategies are designed for different annotation levels. A multi-level training strategy enables joint training on all levels of annotated samples.

Main Contributions:
- Design of MLS-BRN with new modules and tasks to enhance relation between building components and reduce 3D annotation demand
- Proposal of multi-level training strategy to enable training with different supervision levels  
- Significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art with much fewer 3D-annotated samples
- Extended datasets to more cities and comprehensive experiments demonstrating potential for large-scale cross-city application

The method greatly reduces annotation cost and achieves strong performance across diverse settings, offering an efficient and flexible solution for 3D building reconstruction from monocular images.
