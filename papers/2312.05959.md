# [VAE-IF: Deep feature extraction with averaging for unsupervised artifact   detection in routine acquired ICU time-series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Artifacts are a major issue in physiological time-series data collected routinely from Intensive Care Units (ICU). These artifacts, caused by things like sensor detachments or patient movements, degrade the quality of the data and make subsequent analysis unreliable. Manually detecting artifacts is impractical due to the large volumes of data. Therefore, developing automated techniques for artifact detection in ICU data is an important area of research. However, existing techniques have limitations - they require high temporal resolution signals, are designed for specific signal types, or need labeled data for model training.

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes a completely unsupervised approach called VAE-IF that detects artifacts in minute-resolution ICU time-series without needing any labels. It combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) and isolation forest (iForest). First, a VAE model is trained on raw ICU data containing both clean samples and artifacts. This VAE's encoder extracts features from new ICU signals, which are averaged to get robust sample representations. These features are input to an iForest model to detect anomalies (artifacts). 

Main Contributions:
1) A novel unsupervised VAE-IF approach for artifact detection in minute-resolution ICU signals that works without any labels.
2) A supervised LSTM classifier with attention mechanism as a benchmark. 
3) Experiments on a real ICU dataset comparing VAE-IF to LSTM and XGBoost classifiers. VAE-IF achieves comparable sensitivity to these supervised models.
4) Visualizations showing the VAE model learns to disentangle clean vs noisy samples. 
5) Validation on an external ICU dataset, demonstrating generalizability without retraining.

The key advantage of this unsupervised approach over existing techniques is it eliminates the need for labeled data for model training. Results show it can effectively detect artifacts in minute-resolution vital signs from ICU, making it valuable for clinical research and care.
