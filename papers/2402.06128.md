# [Rethinking Node-wise Propagation for Large-scale Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Rethinking Node-wise Propagation for Large-scale Graph Learning":

Problem:
- Existing scalable graph neural networks (GNNs) typically use fixed propagation rules that treat all nodes the same during message passing. This ignores the unique topological roles of each node.
- Node-wise propagation (NP) methods have been proposed to customize propagation steps per node, but they rely on global graph analysis that can be biased on large intricate graphs. 
- Key insight: Different nodes (high vs low degree) require different propagation rules to capture their local node context (LNC).

Proposed Solution:
- Adaptive Topology-aware Propagation (ATP) framework with two components:
   1) High-bias propagation correction: Uses masking to regularize connections of high-degree nodes to improve convergence and reduce redundancy
   2) Weight-free LNC encoding: Encodes node degree and eigenvector centrality to capture LNC without learning. Uses this to set custom propagation rules per node.
- ATP is plug-and-play, orthogonal to existing NP methods. Integrates with GNN propagation equations.

Main Contributions:
- Provides empirical analysis showing need to handle high-degree nodes differently.
- Proposes ATP for node-customized propagation as a flexible plug-in module for GNNs.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance over 12 datasets. Shows 4-5% avg gains over strong GNN baselines.
- Ablation studies validate benefits of high-bias correction and LNC encoding components.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights on limitations of global analysis for NP on large graphs, and presents an efficient topology-aware solution to achieve customized propagation rules per node's local context. The proposed ATP framework significantly enhances scalable GNN performance.
