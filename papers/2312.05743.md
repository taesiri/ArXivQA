# [Building Variable-sized Models via Learngene Pool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Building Variable-sized Models via Learngene Pool":

Problem: 
- Designing and training variable-sized deep learning models for different hardware constraints is time-consuming and impractical. 
- Recently proposed Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Nets) can quickly build variable-sized models by stitching blocks from pre-trained models, but has limitations:
    - Requires storing many large pre-trained models, consuming substantial storage.
    - Cannot build very small models due to dependence on smallest pre-trained model size.
    - Uses unlearned stitch layers, limiting performance.

Proposed Solution - Learngene Pool:
- Distill knowledge from one large ancestry model into multiple small auxiliary models. 
- Take each block in auxiliary models as a "learngene instance" to build a learngene pool.
- Stitch instances from the pool into new variable-sized descendant models.
- Initialize stitch layers with learned transformations from distillation.

Main Contributions:
- Reduces storage needs compared to SN-Nets.
- Can build smaller models by using smaller instances.  
- Enhances performance over SN-Nets via learned stitch layers.
- Saves training costs by leveraging distilled auxiliary models rather than training all sizes from scratch.
- Outperforms SN-Nets in accuracy under same storage budgets.
- Adapts to lower size constraints than SN-Nets.

In summary, the proposed Learngene Pool method builds on ideas from SN-Nets and Learngene to construct variable-sized models more efficiently. Key innovations include forming a learngene pool from distilled knowledge and enhancing stitch layers. This saves storage, builds smaller models, and improves accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Learngene Pool, a novel method to construct a pool of small network blocks (learngene instances) by distilling knowledge from a large pre-trained model, which can then be stitched together in different combinations to efficiently build variable-sized models for diverse resource constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called "Learngene Pool" to build variable-sized descendant models from a single pre-trained large model (ancestry model). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing to distill the ancestry model into multiple smaller auxiliary models, and use each block in these auxiliary models as "learngene instances" to construct a pool (learngene pool). Compared to SN-Net which requires multiple independently trained models, this saves storage resources.

2) The smaller learngene instances allow constructing smaller descendant models to satisfy low resource constraints, overcoming SN-Net's limitation of building models no smaller than the smallest anchor. 

3) Initializing the stitch layers in the learngene pool using learned block-based transformation matrices instead of the unlearned least squares method as in SN-Net. This leads to improved performance of the constructed descendant models.

4) Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Learngene Pool. It saves storage resources, builds smaller models for low resources, and achieves better accuracy compared to SN-Net given the same storage costs.

In summary, the key innovation is the idea of distilling one ancestry model into a pool of smaller learngene instances that can be stitched into variable-sized descendant models superior to SN-Net.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Learngene Pool: The proposed method to build variable-sized models by distilling knowledge into a pool of learngene instances which can be stitched together.

- Learngene: The critical part extracted from a larger pre-trained model that contains essential information and knowledge. Used to build the learngene pool. 

- Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Net): An existing method that stitches together blocks from different pre-trained models to construct variable-sized models.

- Auxiliary Models: Smaller models designed with fewer blocks and lower dimensions that are distilled from the ancestry model. Their blocks are used as learngene instances.

- Dense Distillation: Distilling from multiple blocks of the ancestry model instead of just the last block, to transfer more knowledge.

- Transformation Matrices: Learnable matrices used during distillation to match dimensions between auxiliary and ancestry models. Also used to initialize stitch layers.

- Descendant Models: The variable-sized models built by stitching together learngene instances from the pool.

- Model Stitching: The concept of connecting layers from different models to construct new models.

So in summary, key terms cover the proposed Learngene Pool method, the concept of learngene, model stitching, distillation techniques, and the models involved in the overall process.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes extracting "learngene instances" from auxiliary models distilled from a pre-trained ancestry model. What are some key considerations and challenges when determining how to design the architecture of these auxiliary models? 

2) When distilling the ancestry model to the auxiliary models, the paper employs prediction, block, and attention-based distillation losses. What is the motivation behind using all three? Could any be removed or are there other distillation techniques that could further improve performance?

3) The proposed Learngene Pool method combines techniques from both Learngene and SN-Net. In what key ways does it improve upon each method and mitigate their limitations? What limitations still remain?

4) The paper finds that distilling multiple blocks works better for auxiliary models with different output dimensions compared to the ancestry model. Why might this be the case? Does this provide any insight into how information flows in transformers?

5) When constructing the Learngene Pool, instances are ordered by output dimension size. What is the motivation for this? Are there other potential ways the pool could be organized?

6) The method proposes a learned initialization for stitch layers based on distillation. Why is this better than SN-Net's least squares initialization? Could other initialization approaches further improve performance?

7) What are the key differences in how Learngene Pool and SN-Net enable building variable-sized models? What are the tradeoffs between these approaches in terms of flexibility, performance, and efficiency? 

8) How does the scale and construction of the Learngene Pool contribute to its improved ability to build smaller models compared to SN-Net? What determines the minimum model size that can be built?

9) When fine-tuning the Learngene Pool itself, distillation provides minimal gains given the proposed learned stitch layer initialization. Why might this be the case? What does this suggest about the role of distillation?

10) The ancestry model used in the paper is DeiT-Base. How might the choice of ancestry model impact the effectiveness and performance of models built from the resulting Learngene Pool? What properties make for an optimal ancestry model?
