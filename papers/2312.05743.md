# [Building Variable-sized Models via Learngene Pool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Building Variable-sized Models via Learngene Pool":

Problem: 
- Designing and training variable-sized deep learning models for different hardware constraints is time-consuming and impractical. 
- Recently proposed Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Nets) can quickly build variable-sized models by stitching blocks from pre-trained models, but has limitations:
    - Requires storing many large pre-trained models, consuming substantial storage.
    - Cannot build very small models due to dependence on smallest pre-trained model size.
    - Uses unlearned stitch layers, limiting performance.

Proposed Solution - Learngene Pool:
- Distill knowledge from one large ancestry model into multiple small auxiliary models. 
- Take each block in auxiliary models as a "learngene instance" to build a learngene pool.
- Stitch instances from the pool into new variable-sized descendant models.
- Initialize stitch layers with learned transformations from distillation.

Main Contributions:
- Reduces storage needs compared to SN-Nets.
- Can build smaller models by using smaller instances.  
- Enhances performance over SN-Nets via learned stitch layers.
- Saves training costs by leveraging distilled auxiliary models rather than training all sizes from scratch.
- Outperforms SN-Nets in accuracy under same storage budgets.
- Adapts to lower size constraints than SN-Nets.

In summary, the proposed Learngene Pool method builds on ideas from SN-Nets and Learngene to construct variable-sized models more efficiently. Key innovations include forming a learngene pool from distilled knowledge and enhancing stitch layers. This saves storage, builds smaller models, and improves accuracy.
