# [SMART: Submodular Data Mixture Strategy for Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instruction tuning involves fine-tuning language models on instruction-formatted datasets to enhance their ability to follow instructions and generalize to new tasks. 
- Finding the right mixture of tasks and the proportions to sample from each task is critical but currently done manually or based on intuition. 
- The paper focuses on two key research questions: (1) Given a large dataset and budget constraint, how to divide the budget among tasks and select instances? (2) Can a subset of representative tasks give similar performance as using all tasks?

Proposed Solution:
- The paper models the data mixture problem as two submodular maximization problems: (1) select a weighted subset of tasks (2) select instances from those tasks based on their budgets.  
- Submodularity helps select a diverse, non-redundant subset that acts as a good surrogate to the full dataset. 
- Task embeddings are obtained by averaging prompt embeddings and used to calculate task similarities.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes SMART - a novel submodular data mixture strategy for instruction tuning that outperforms baselines.
- Shows that peak performance is achieved using a subset of representative tasks, beyond which performance drops, suggesting judicious task scaling. 
- Reveals that whether instances should capture representation or diversity depends on the task budget - for lower budgets, representation is key while for higher budgets, diversity becomes important.

In summary, the paper provides a systematic submodular approach to create optimized data mixtures for instruction tuning based on budget constraints. The analysis also offers insights into optimal task compositions and instance selections.
