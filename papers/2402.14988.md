# [Verifiable Boosted Tree Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14988)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tree ensembles like gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are widely used for classification tasks, but they are vulnerable to evasion attacks. 
- Verifying robustness against evasion attacks is computationally intractable (NP-hard) for tree ensembles.
- Prior work proposed "large-spread" ensembles for efficient robustness verification but only applies to simple voting-based ensembles, not state-of-the-art boosted ensembles like LightGBM or XGBoost.

Proposed Solution:
- Extend theory of large-spread ensembles to boosted tree ensembles based on raw score predictions and thresholding.  
- Formulate robustness verification as an optimization problem to find worst-case attack.
- Develop efficient algorithms to solve this problem in:
   - Linear time for L_inf attackers
   - Pseudo-polynomial time for L_0 and L_p attackers
- Implement verification tool CARVE-GBM and training algorithm for large-spread boosted ensembles in LightGBM.

Main Contributions:
- First framework for efficient robustness verification of boosted tree ensembles against evasion attacks. 
- Polynomial time robustness verification algorithm for L_inf attacks.
- Pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for other norm attacks.
- Accuracy of large-spread boosted ensembles on par with GBDTs like LightGBM.
- Experiments show CARVE-GBM provides up to 400x speedup in verification time over state-of-the-art with no loss in accuracy.

In summary, the paper enables efficient and exact robustness verification for boosted tree ensembles while retaining high accuracy, through novel large-spread ensemble training and tailored optimization algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes efficient algorithms for verifying the robustness of large-spread boosted tree ensembles against evasion attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Extending existing research on verifiable learning from basic ensemble methods (i.e. hard majority voting) to advanced boosted tree ensembles, such as those trained using XGBoost or LightGBM. The paper shows that a restricted class of models called "large-spread boosted ensembles" can be verified for robustness in polynomial time against $L_\infty$-norm attackers, but verification remains NP-hard for other norms. Still, the paper presents a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for verifying robustness against $L_p$-norm attackers.

2. Implementing the efficient verification algorithms for large-spread boosted ensembles and proposing a new training algorithm for such models, deployed as an extension of the LightGBM library. The implementation and training code will be made publicly available.

3. Performing an extensive experimental evaluation on public datasets to demonstrate that large-spread boosted ensembles are accurate and robust enough for practical use, while also being amenable to efficient security verification. The experiments show speedups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to verification of traditional boosted ensembles.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the state-of-the-art in verifiable learning to make boosted tree ensembles amenable to efficient and exact security verification, while preserving accuracy and robustness. This is achieved through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, implementation, and experimental validation.
