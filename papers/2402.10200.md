# [Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work on improving reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has focused heavily on prompting techniques like few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, these methods often require extensive, task-specific prompt engineering. 

- This paper asks: can LLMs reason effectively without any prompting, by simply altering the decoding process?

Key Findings:
- Surprisingly, the paper shows that by exploring alternative top-k tokens during decoding, rather than greedy decoding, CoT reasoning paths emerge naturally from LLMs without prompting. 

- The paper finds that when a CoT path is present, the LLM has higher confidence in decoding the final answer. This confidence gap distinguishes CoT vs non-CoT paths.

Proposed Solution - CoT-Decoding: 
- Leveraging the confidence gap phenomenon, the paper proposes CoT-decoding to extract reliable CoT paths from the top-k decoding trajectories. 

- Specifically, CoT-decoding selects paths based on the probability gap between the top two token choices when decoding the final answer.

- No extra supervision or fine-tuning is needed.

Key Results:
- Extensive experiments show CoT-decoding unveils inherent reasoning capabilities in LLMs and significantly improves performance over greedy decoding on math, commonsense and symbolic reasoning tasks.

- CoT-decoding also partially closes the gap between pre-trained and instructed-tuned LLMs, showing the efficacy of this simple decoding change.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrating LLMs inherently possess reasoning capabilities, evident through CoT paths in alternative decoding trajectories, without prompting.

- Proposing CoT-decoding to reliably extract these paths, enhancing reasoning over greedy decoding across benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new decoding approach called CoT-decoding that elicits inherent chain-of-thought reasoning from large language models by exploring alternative top tokens during decoding rather than relying solely on greedy decoding paths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper reveals that pre-trained language models inherently possess reasoning capabilities, as evidenced by their generation of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths when examining alternative top tokens during decoding, rather than relying solely on greedy decoding. This finding contrasts with prior research focused on improved prompting for reasoning, highlighting that a mere change in decoding strategy can effectively elicit model reasoning.

2. The paper finds that the language model's confidence in its final answers, measured by the probability difference between the top two tokens, increases when a CoT is present in its decoding path. Leveraging this increased confidence, the paper proposes CoT-decoding to select more reliable decoding paths from language models, demonstrating significant improvements over greedy decoding across various reasoning benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is showing that reasoning capabilities can be elicited from language models without specialized prompting techniques, by simply modifying the decoding process to uncover inherent CoT reasoning paths. The proposed CoT-decoding technique leverages model confidence to extract reliable paths, achieving strong performance gains over greedy decoding on reasoning tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning: The paper focuses on eliciting reasoning paths that show the step-by-step logic behind how a model arrives at an answer. These paths are referred to as "chain-of-thought" or CoT. 

- Decoding algorithms: Rather than relying on prompting techniques, the paper explores modifying the decoding process to uncover CoT reasoning paths inherent within large language models.

- Top-k token inspection: The approach considers alternative top-k tokens during decoding to find CoT paths, instead of solely greedy decoding.

- Confidence scores: The presence of a CoT path correlates with higher model confidence in the final answer. This confidence score is used to identify reliable CoT reasoning paths.  

- CoT-decoding: The proposed method of extracting CoT paths by identifying high-confidence decoding trajectories using the confidence score metric.

- Unsupervised reasoning: The goal of eliciting reasoning without reliance on manually-designed prompts or model fine-tuning. Assessing the intrinsic reasoning abilities of large language models.

- Mathematical reasoning: Evaluation across tasks requiring mathematical reasoning and calculation.

- Natural language reasoning: Assessment on tasks needing reasoning over real-world knowledge and common sense, such as determining a year's parity.

In summary, the key focus is on using alternative decoding paths and confidence scores to uncover inherent chain-of-thought reasoning within large language models, without specialized prompting or supervision.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces CoT-decoding to elicit reasoning capabilities from language models without explicit prompting. How does this approach differ fundamentally from existing prompting techniques for reasoning, and what are the key advantages?

2. The paper finds that chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths naturally emerge when exploring alternative top tokens during decoding. What underlying properties of language models contribute to this phenomenon, and why does greedy decoding fail to uncover these paths?  

3. When comparing the confidence scores between CoT and non-CoT decoding paths, the paper observes increased model confidence for CoT paths. What factors contribute to this difference in confidence? How can this insight be leveraged for identifying reliable reasoning trajectories?

4. The paper branches on alternative tokens primarily at the first decoding step. How does the choice of branching point impact the diversity and accuracy of resulting decoding paths? What are some of the key tradeoffs to consider?

5. When comparing CoT-decoding with prompting techniques like few-shot and zero-shot CoT prompting, what differences emerge in the types of reasoning paths generated? How do these qualitative distinctions provide further insight into models' intrinsic reasoning abilities?

6. The paper finds CoT-decoding to be less effective on complex, synthetic reasoning tasks lacking representation in the pre-training data. In these cases, how can advanced prompting techniques complement CoT-decoding? What is the interplay between pre-training and prompting for reasoning?  

7. The paper aggregates answers from the top CoT paths using a confidence-based weighting technique. How does this aggregation methodology compare to approaches like self-consistency? What are the limitations and scope for improvement in aggregating multiple decoding paths?

8. For open-ended reasoning tasks, identifying answer spans for computing model confidence poses challenges. The paper discusses some techniques to address this, but what difficulties remain? How can future work enhance answer span detection in such scenarios?

9. While primarily focused on accuracy, how can CoT-decoding be adapted to improve other qualities like coherence, fluency, and diversity of reasoning paths? What modifications would be required in the path extraction and selection methodology?

10. The paper remains focused on enhancing reasoning through decoding modifications after pre-training. How do techniques like instruction tuning and distillation offer complementary ways to improve language models' reasoning abilities in conjunction with CoT-decoding? What is the scope for transferability between these methods?
