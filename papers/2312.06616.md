# [The built environment and induced transport CO2 emissions: A double   machine learning approach to account for residential self-selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the impact of the built environment (density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, distance to transit) on travel behavior and emissions is critical for sustainable urban planning. 
- However, the effect is confounded by residential self-selection, where people choose neighborhoods matching their pre-existing travel preferences.
- Existing studies either focus on capturing non-linear relationships using machine learning or on accounting for residential self-selection using statistical methods. Bringing both approaches together can provide better insights.

Methods:
- Use travel survey data and built environment data for Berlin, Germany to estimate neighborhood-level travel behavior.
- Propose a double machine learning (DML) approach with Causal Forests to estimate the causal effect of the built environment on travel-related CO2 emissions while controlling for residential self-selection.
- Characterize residential self-selection using socio-demographics and proxies for travel attitudes. 
- Decompose effect into the 5Ds and examine heterogeneity across household groups.
- Assess emissions of planned new housing projects under different allocation strategies.

Key Results:
- Built environment causes neighborhood emissions to differ by almost 100% between city center and suburbs in Berlin.  
- Destination accessibility explains 75% of the effect. Density is second most important.  
- Effect is greater for larger, older and higher-income households.
- Alternative housing allocation focused on transit accessibility or low-emissions neighborhoods could reduce emissions by 15-30% vs planned projects.

Main Contributions:
- Novel DML approach to quantify causal effect of built environment on travel emissions at a fine-grained spatial scale.
- Analysis of heterogeneous effects and detailed decomposition into 5Ds.
- Practical urban planning case study for Berlin highlighting need and strategies for sustainable development.
