# [Automated Multi-Task Learning for Joint Disease Prediction on Electronic   Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHR) provide a rich source of data that can be used to build machine learning models for predicting patients' future health conditions. 
- Multi-task learning (MTL) frameworks have been proposed that jointly predict multiple related diseases, aiming to improve performance over single-task models.
- However, existing MTL frameworks have two key limitations: 1) they rely on human experts to manually determine which tasks to group together for training, 2) they use hand-crafted neural architectures for modeling the tasks. Both are suboptimal.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AutoDP, an automated MTL framework for joint disease prediction on EHR that searches for optimal task grouping and neural architectures.
- A surrogate model is built to predict the MTL performance gain for any task group and architecture without needing to train them. This allows efficient search through the enormous joint space of groupings and architectures.  
- An active sampling strategy is used to selectively choose samples to minimize the number of expensive MTL evaluations needed to train the surrogate model.
- Finally, a greedy search algorithm leverages the trained surrogate to derive a near-optimal MTL configuration of task groups and architectures.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to automate the joint optimization of task grouping and architecture search for MTL on EHR data.
- Novel surrogate model to enable efficient search through the huge joint space.
- Active sampling technique to minimize number of expensive MTL evaluations.  
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC dataset, significantly outperforming both manual and automated baselines.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative automated framework to overcome key limitations of existing MTL methods for EHR analysis. By jointly optimizing task grouping and architectures, it achieves much better predictive performance.
