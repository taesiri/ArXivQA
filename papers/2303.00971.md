# [Disentangling Orthogonal Planes for Indoor Panoramic Room Layout   Estimation with Cross-Scale Distortion Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00971)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve panoramic depth estimation on equirectangular maps by better handling the distortion that increases from the center to the poles?The key points are:- Depth estimation on equirectangular maps is challenging due to the increasing distortion, especially near the poles. Existing methods have limitations in handling this distortion. - The authors propose a distortion-adapted panoramic transformer (ADAPT) to improve panoramic depth estimation. - They redesign the self-attention mechanism to be distortion-aware, by generating spherical tokens and using equi-attention. This makes the model adapt better to distortions in different regions of the equirectangular map.- They also propose new evaluation metrics tailored for panoramic depth estimation: Pole Root Mean Square Error (P-RMSE) and Left-Right Consistency Error (LRCE).- Experiments on indoor panorama datasets demonstrate their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly handling distortion in a transformer architecture can lead to better panoramic depth estimation, which they demonstrate through the proposed ADAPT model and experiments. The paper focuses on addressing the core challenge of distortion for this task.
