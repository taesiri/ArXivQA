# [Disentangling Orthogonal Planes for Indoor Panoramic Room Layout   Estimation with Cross-Scale Distortion Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00971)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve panoramic depth estimation on equirectangular maps by better handling the distortion that increases from the center to the poles?The key points are:- Depth estimation on equirectangular maps is challenging due to the increasing distortion, especially near the poles. Existing methods have limitations in handling this distortion. - The authors propose a distortion-adapted panoramic transformer (ADAPT) to improve panoramic depth estimation. - They redesign the self-attention mechanism to be distortion-aware, by generating spherical tokens and using equi-attention. This makes the model adapt better to distortions in different regions of the equirectangular map.- They also propose new evaluation metrics tailored for panoramic depth estimation: Pole Root Mean Square Error (P-RMSE) and Left-Right Consistency Error (LRCE).- Experiments on indoor panorama datasets demonstrate their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly handling distortion in a transformer architecture can lead to better panoramic depth estimation, which they demonstrate through the proposed ADAPT model and experiments. The paper focuses on addressing the core challenge of distortion for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper appears to be proposing a distortion-adapted panoramic transformer (ADAPT) for indoor depth estimation from equirectangular panoramic images. The main contributions seem to be:1. Redesigning the transformer architecture to be suitable for panoramic depth estimation, including:- Dividing image patches on the spherical domain to adapt to distortions. - An "equi-attention" module to reduce computation by only attending to relevant points.2. Proposing two new evaluation metrics:- Pole Root Mean Square Error (P-RMSE) to measure accuracy near the poles.- Left-Right Consistency Error (LRCE) to measure consistency across left/right boundaries. 3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed ADAPT method outperforms prior state-of-the-art on panoramic depth estimation, showing the benefits of the redesigned transformer architecture and the new evaluation metrics.In summary, the key contribution appears to be a distortion-aware transformer tailored for panoramic images, along with new metrics, that pushes state-of-the-art in depth estimation for this challenging panoramic setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a distortion-adapted panoramic transformer (ADAPT) for high quality depth estimation from equirectangular maps by redesigning the self-attention mechanism to select relevant points and generate spherical tokens resilient to distortion, and introducing new metrics for panoramic depth evaluation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research on indoor panoramic room layout estimation:- The paper proposes a novel framework to disentangle orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) planes in order to capture explicit geometric cues for layout estimation. Most prior work compresses 2D feature maps into a 1D sequence which confuses plane semantics. - A soft-flipping fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the symmetry between floor and ceiling boundaries based on the Manhattan World assumption. This is a unique contribution not explored in other papers.- The paper presents a cross-scale distortion-aware feature assembling mechanism to integrate shallow and deep features while handling distortion distribution. Other recent papers have not focused much on handling distortions.- Triple attention is used to reconstruct the disentangled 1D sequences - graph attention for discriminative channels, self-attention for long-range dependencies, and cross-attention for missing residuals. This goes beyond standard attention mechanisms used in layout estimation.- Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, especially on the 3DIoU metric which measures 3D layout accuracy. The disentangling strategy appears highly effective.In summary, the key novelties are the orthogonal plane disentanglement, soft-flipping fusion, distortion-aware feature fusion, and triple attention reconstruction. This provides both representation and architectural improvements over prior work for better exploiting geometric cues in panoramic images. The results validate the advantages of the proposed techniques.
