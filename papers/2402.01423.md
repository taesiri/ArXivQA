# [Different Tastes of Entities: Investigating Human Label Variation in   Named Entity Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental NLP task, but human label variation (disagreements) in NER annotations hinders model performance. 
- Little is known about sources of disagreements in high-quality NER datasets beyond English CoNLL03.

Approach: 
- Analyze label disagreements in expert-annotated NER datasets across 3 languages: English, Danish, Bavarian.
- Datasets have multiple annotation efforts on same texts, allowing diachronic analysis.
- Identify disagreement types: tag, span, both, missing entities. 
- Manually categorize sources as text ambiguity, guideline differences, annotator errors.
- Survey student annotations on difficult entities to validate distributions.

Key Findings:
- Tag disagreements dominate, especially loc-org and org-misc confusions.
- Guideline differences and text ambiguities cause most expert disagreements.  
- Annotator errors more frequent in new Bavarian dataset vs established English/Danish.
- Student annotations also show high label variation for difficult entities.

Main Contributions:
- First analysis of expert disagreements in high-quality NER across multiple languages
- Demonstrates ubiquitous human judgment variations in semantic typing beyond crowdsourced data
- Discovers dominant sources stem from evolving guidelines and lexical/world knowledge gaps  
- Provides insights and data to improve learning from disagreements in NER

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive study of expert annotation disagreements in NER across languages, reveals guideline differences and ambiguities as key factors, and sets the stage for better modeling label variations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines disagreements in expert-annotated named entity recognition datasets across English, Danish and Bavarian, finding that guideline changes and textual ambiguities are the main sources of disagreements in established datasets while annotator errors cause most disagreements in newer datasets, and shows through a student survey that even with minimal training annotators diverge in marginal entity cases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It examines and analyzes disagreements in expert-annotated named entity datasets for three languages: English, Danish, and Bavarian. This allows the authors to contrast expert disagreements with the more common setting of individual annotations.

2. It categorizes the sources of disagreements into text ambiguity, guideline updates, and annotator errors. By manually analyzing samples of disagreements, the authors discover that guideline updates and text ambiguities are the major sources in established English and Danish datasets, while annotator errors dominate in the new Bavarian dataset. 

3. It surveys annotations from students on difficult/ambiguous named entities to inspect the distribution of multiple valid interpretations. This demonstrates that label variation is also prevalent in student annotations and encourages more exploration of named entity label variations.

4. It releases annotated disagreements and analyses for English, Danish and Bavarian named entity datasets to promote further research in this direction.

In summary, the key contribution is a quantitative and qualitative analysis of expert disagreements in named entity annotation, the sources that cause them, and a survey of student annotations on difficult cases. This sheds light on the issue of label variation in NER and motivates learning from disagreements.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Label variation
- Disagreements
- Human annotation 
- Expert annotations
- Text ambiguity
- Guideline updates
- Annotator errors
- English, Danish, Bavarian
- CoNLL03 dataset
- Sources of disagreements

The paper examines disagreements and label variations in expert-annotated named entity datasets across three languages - English, Danish and Bavarian. It looks at datasets where multiple annotation efforts exist on the same text. Keythings analyzed are entity-level disagreements, sources of disagreements (text ambiguity, guideline updates, annotator errors), as well as surveying student annotations on difficult entities. Overall, the paper provides quantitative and qualitative analyses of annotator disagreements on labeling named entities, in order to better understand the issues and distributions around human annotation variation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper analyzes disagreements between expert annotations of named entities. How does this differ from previous work that has focused more on crowd-sourced or unreliable annotations? What are the advantages of studying expert disagreements?

2. The paper categorizes sources of disagreements into text ambiguity, guideline updates, and annotator errors. Can you describe these categories in more detail? What are some examples of each from the analyses in the paper? 

3. The authors align tokenization across different versions of the CoNLL datasets before analysis. Why is this alignment important? What issues could arise from not properly aligning tokens?

4. What are the proportions of different disagreement types (Tag, Span, Both, Missing) found in the English, Danish, and Bavarian datasets? What similarities and differences do you notice across languages?

5. The paper surveys student annotations on difficult named entities. What was the purpose of this survey? What kinds of entities showed high disagreement rates among students?

6. Can you describe the guideline changes that accounted for many disagreements between original CoNLL03 annotations and the clean version? How do these updates demonstrate the subjectivity inherent in defining annotation guidelines?  

7. Besides text ambiguity and guideline updates, what are some potential sources of annotator errors found in the Bavarian disgreements? When can it be difficult to categorize disagreements as errors vs acceptable under different guidelines?

8. How could the distributions of student annotations on difficult named entities be useful for developing NER systems? What approaches leverage multiple acceptable labels?

9. The authors plan to conduct annotation studies on a larger scale. What benefits could this provide over the small surveys done so far? What are some challenges to consider with large-scale annotation efforts?

10. The paper focuses on analyzing disagreements. How could the next steps go beyond analysis to actually exploit disagreements and ambiguity to build better models? What existing methods aim to model label distributions?
