# [Different Tastes of Entities: Investigating Human Label Variation in   Named Entity Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental NLP task, but human label variation (disagreements) in NER annotations hinders model performance. 
- Little is known about sources of disagreements in high-quality NER datasets beyond English CoNLL03.

Approach: 
- Analyze label disagreements in expert-annotated NER datasets across 3 languages: English, Danish, Bavarian.
- Datasets have multiple annotation efforts on same texts, allowing diachronic analysis.
- Identify disagreement types: tag, span, both, missing entities. 
- Manually categorize sources as text ambiguity, guideline differences, annotator errors.
- Survey student annotations on difficult entities to validate distributions.

Key Findings:
- Tag disagreements dominate, especially loc-org and org-misc confusions.
- Guideline differences and text ambiguities cause most expert disagreements.  
- Annotator errors more frequent in new Bavarian dataset vs established English/Danish.
- Student annotations also show high label variation for difficult entities.

Main Contributions:
- First analysis of expert disagreements in high-quality NER across multiple languages
- Demonstrates ubiquitous human judgment variations in semantic typing beyond crowdsourced data
- Discovers dominant sources stem from evolving guidelines and lexical/world knowledge gaps  
- Provides insights and data to improve learning from disagreements in NER

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive study of expert annotation disagreements in NER across languages, reveals guideline differences and ambiguities as key factors, and sets the stage for better modeling label variations.
