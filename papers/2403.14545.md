# [Learning Hierarchical Control For Multi-Agent Capacity-Constrained   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of dynamically assigning tasks and controlling a fleet of autonomous, capacity-constrained agents (e.g. robots, vehicles) that must complete iterative tasks in an environment. Specifically, it looks at how to maximize the number of tasks completed by the agents over multiple executions while ensuring their limited capacities (e.g. battery level, time) are not depleted. This is challenging due to the computational complexity of jointly optimizing high-level task assignments and low-level motions controls in real-time.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a hierarchical control framework that consists of:

1) A high-level controller that dynamically assigns tasks to each agent by solving an optimization problem over a graph representation of the tasks and environment. It plans routes for the agents while robustly accounting for constraints on the agents' capacities.

2) A low-level model predictive control (MPC) layer that selects the continuous control inputs needed for the agents to execute their assigned tasks.

Both layers use data-driven MPC policies that leverage collected trajectory data from previous task iterations to improve performance. The high-level incorporates tools from iterative learning control to safely improve task assignments over time as estimates of the agents' capacity usage improves. The low-level MPC utilizes terminal constraints constructed from prior trajectories to ensure assigned tasks remain dynamically feasible despite only using short prediction horizons.


Main Contributions:

1) A computationally-efficient, closed-loop hierarchical architecture for dynamic task assignment and control of capacity-constrained multi-agent systems

2) A method to safely integrate learning at both levels of the hierarchy using ideas from iterative learning control in order to improve performance over task repetitions

3) Feasibility and iterative improvement guarantees for the integrated, learning-based hierarchical control scheme, despite model uncertainty and short control horizons

In summary, the key innovation is enabling safe, iterative improvement of a hierarchical controller for multi-agent systems by coordinating learning between levels. This is achieved through properly constructed data-driven MPC policies and update procedures.
