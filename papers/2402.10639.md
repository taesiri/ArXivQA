# [Generalizability of Mixture of Domain-Specific Adapters from the Lens of   Signed Weight Directions and its Application to Effective Model Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, methods have emerged to mix weights of multiple domain-specific adapters trained on top of pre-trained language models (PLMs), aiming to improve performance on novel, unseen domains. However, it's unclear how well such weight-space merging generalizes on in-domain, unseen examples.

- Several key questions remain regarding the resulting mixtures of domain-specific adapters, especially pertaining to their generalizability and adversarial robustness when mixing very different domains. 

Method and Contributions:
- This paper provides the most comprehensive in-domain evaluation of mixing domain-specific adapters with 3 different adapter methods on 13 diverse classification datasets.

- Through extensive experiments, the paper shows mixing adapters leads to performance degradation both in terms of generalizability to unseen in-domain examples and adversarial robustness. The drop is more severe as more unrelated domains are mixed.  

- The paper provides an analysis showing a strong negative correlation between the fraction of weight sign differences (FSD) among adapters and the performance of their mixtures. This provides insights on "when and what adapters to mix".

- Based on the FSD analysis, the paper demonstrates improved generalizability by mixing sparse versions of adapters. Also shows 90% sparsity preserves performance while enabling more effective pruning.

In summary, this is the first comprehensive analysis explaining when and what domain-specific adapters can be effectively mixed. The analysis of weight sign differences and sparsity provides insights to improve adapter mixing and pruning techniques. The key impact is better understanding for deployment of adapter-based PLMs.
