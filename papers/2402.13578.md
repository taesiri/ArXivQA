# [TransGOP: Transformer-Based Gaze Object Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "TransGOP: Transformer-Based Gaze Object Prediction":

Problem:
The paper addresses the task of gaze object prediction (GOP), which aims to predict both the location and category of the object a human is looking at in an image. Previous works use CNN-based object detectors which have limitations in detecting dense objects in scenes. The paper finds that Transformer-based object detectors are more effective in such scenarios. Moreover, exploiting Transformer's capability of modeling long-range dependencies can help establish better relationships between human gaze and objects. 

Method:
The paper proposes TransGOP, an end-to-end Transformer-based framework for GOP. It contains two branches:

1) Object detector: Uses an off-the-shelf Transformer object detector to detect objects and their categories.

2) Gaze regressor: Contains a Transformer-based gaze autoencoder that takes as input the head image, scene image and head location map. A new object-to-gaze cross-attention mechanism is proposed to enable the gaze autoencoder queries to learn global position knowledge from the object detector. This helps predict more accurate gaze heatmaps.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to introduce Transformer mechanisms for GOP task and propose an end-to-end model TransGOP.

2) Propose an object-to-gaze cross-attention mechanism to establish relationship between object detector and gaze regressor.

3) Propose a Gaze Box loss to jointly optimize object detector and gaze regressor.

4) Achieve state-of-the-art performance on GOP, object detection and gaze estimation on GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets.

The main novelty lies in effectively exploiting Transformer's modeling power for the GOP task through well-designed components tailored for this problem. The end-to-end nature and performance gains demonstrate TransGOP's effectiveness.
