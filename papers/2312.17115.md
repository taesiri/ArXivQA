# [How Far Are We from Believable AI Agents? A Framework for Evaluating the   Believability of Human Behavior Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in using large language models (LLMs) as AI agents to simulate human behavior and social interactions have shown promise across various applications. 
- However, deficiencies inherent to LLMs like struggling with long context modeling and lack of robustness can undermine the believability of these AI agents. 
- Prior works often neglect evaluating the negative impacts of these LLM deficiencies on agent believability.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two novel metrics - consistency and robustness - to assess LLM-based agent believability. 
- Consistency measures if the LLM-generated behavior accurately depicts the identity/role/relationship info in the long profile input.
- Robustness measures if the agent's behaviors maintain robustness when faced with perturbations to the profile.
- Propose SimulateBench - a benchmark with profile data and evaluation datasets to measure consistency and robustness.

Key Contributions:
- First benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM-based agent believability.
- Novel consistency and robustness metrics tailored to assess believability. 
- Analysis of 10 popular LLMs exposes that agents struggle with capturing crucial information from long profiles and are vulnerable even to small profile changes.
- Identification of key factors like demographics, information position and reasoning prompts that significantly impact overall believability.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions around evaluating and improving the believability of LLM-based agents simulating human behavior by proposing appropriate metrics and analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two metrics (consistency and robustness) to evaluate the believability of AI agents for human behavior simulation, introduces a benchmark (SimulateBench) for assessment, and uses it to evaluate popular LLMs, finding deficiencies in their ability to accurately and robustly depict character information from long profile inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes two novel metrics, consistency and robustness, to measure the believability of AI agents that simulate human behavior. 

2) It introduces a benchmark called SimulateBench for character data collection and evaluation of agents' consistency and robustness abilities. SimulateBench includes a profile descriptive framework, a consistency dataset, and a robustness dataset.

3) It evaluates the consistency and robustness of popular LLMs when composed into agents to simulate human behavior. The results show that agents struggle to accurately depict character information from lengthy profiles and are vulnerable to perturbations in the profile input.

4) It identifies several key factors that significantly impact agent believability, including demographic factors in the profile, the position of information in the profile, and different prompting strategies. 

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of new metrics and a benchmark to assess agent believability for human behavior simulation, an analysis of deficiencies of current LLMs in this task, and insights into elements that influence believability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two metrics - consistency and robustness - to evaluate believability of AI agents. How are these metrics defined and measured quantitatively? What are the strengths and weaknesses of using these particular metrics?

2. The paper introduces a new benchmark called SimulateBench. What are the key components of SimulateBench and how does it enable evaluation of consistency and robustness? What are some limitations of the current benchmark design?

3. When measuring consistency, the paper assigns different weights for Known and Not-Known questions. What is the rationale behind this weighted scheme? Are there alternative weighting methods that could be explored? 

4. For measuring robustness, the paper uses coefficient of variation (RCoV) of consistency scores. What are some other robustness metrics that could provide additional insights into model performance?

5. The results show API models outperform open-source models in consistency. What factors may contribute to this performance gap? How can open-source models be improved to match API models?

6. The paper introduces a new concept called "Simulate Hallucination." How is this phenomenon characterized? What may be the underlying causes of such hallucinations? Can techniques like credibility modeling help address this issue?

7. When analyzing influential factors, homogenity in model preferences for certain profile factors is observed. Is this an artifact of shared training data or indicative of inherent biases? How can diversity be promoted?

8. Information position is found to impact consistency in open-source but not API models. Why does this differential effect occur? Would retrieval augmented models show similar behaviors?  

9. For few-shot prompting, some models perform worse than zero-shot. Is this failure indicative of model architecture limitations? How can sample efficiency be improved via prompt/data optimization?

10. Beyond consistency and robustness, what additional dimensions of believability could be valuable to evaluate? How may multi-task training help models develop well-rounded believable behavior?
