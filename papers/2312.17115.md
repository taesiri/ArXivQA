# [How Far Are We from Believable AI Agents? A Framework for Evaluating the   Believability of Human Behavior Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in using large language models (LLMs) as AI agents to simulate human behavior and social interactions have shown promise across various applications. 
- However, deficiencies inherent to LLMs like struggling with long context modeling and lack of robustness can undermine the believability of these AI agents. 
- Prior works often neglect evaluating the negative impacts of these LLM deficiencies on agent believability.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two novel metrics - consistency and robustness - to assess LLM-based agent believability. 
- Consistency measures if the LLM-generated behavior accurately depicts the identity/role/relationship info in the long profile input.
- Robustness measures if the agent's behaviors maintain robustness when faced with perturbations to the profile.
- Propose SimulateBench - a benchmark with profile data and evaluation datasets to measure consistency and robustness.

Key Contributions:
- First benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM-based agent believability.
- Novel consistency and robustness metrics tailored to assess believability. 
- Analysis of 10 popular LLMs exposes that agents struggle with capturing crucial information from long profiles and are vulnerable even to small profile changes.
- Identification of key factors like demographics, information position and reasoning prompts that significantly impact overall believability.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions around evaluating and improving the believability of LLM-based agents simulating human behavior by proposing appropriate metrics and analysis.
