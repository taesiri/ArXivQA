# [Implicit Subgoal Planning with Variational Autoencoders for Long-Horizon   Sparse Reward Robotic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Long-horizon tasks in robotics remain challenging due to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards in traditional reinforcement learning approaches. Humans can infer subgoals and reason about the final goal in the context of subgoals to accomplish long-horizon tasks effectively. However, current methods for robotic subgoal planning require explicit specification of the number of subgoals upfront or rely solely on an explicit model to infer subgoals.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Variational Autoencoder-based Subgoal Inference (VAESI), a novel algorithm to accomplish long-horizon tasks through incremental subgoal planning. VAESI has three key components:

1) VAE-based Subgoal Generator: Employs an explicit encoder to generate subgoals conditioned on current state and final goal. Also uses an implicit decoder model to reconstruct the final goal from current state and subgoal to enhance subgoal quality. 

2) Hindsight Sampler: Selects valid historical subgoals from experience replay buffer to guide the generator to produce feasible subgoals.

3) Value Selector: Ranks subgoal candidates using value function to filter optimal subgoals.

By combining explicit and implicit models for subgoal reasoning, ensuring feasibility through hindsight sampling, and optimality via value selection, VAESI can effectively divide-and-conquer long-horizon tasks.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel VAE-based subgoal generator with explicit encoder and implicit decoder to enhance subgoal inference.

2) Hindsight Sampler utilizing offline data to improve subgoal feasibility. 

3) Value Selector to filter optimal subgoals from candidates.

4) Promising performance over baselines on 1 locomotion and 3 manipulation tasks in simulation and real-world.

The algorithm represents an effective framework for long-horizon robotic task planning through incremental abstraction of subgoals. Key novelty lies in the hybrid explicit-implicit model for subgoal reasoning and techniques to ensure quality subgoals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Variational Autoencoder-based Subgoal Inference algorithm to incrementally generate feasible and optimal subgoals from an initial state and desired goal to guide a robot in solving long-horizon sparse reward tasks through a divide-and-conquer approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based Subgoal Generator that uses both an explicit model to infer subgoals and an implicit model to enhance the quality of the generated subgoals. 

2. It introduces a Hindsight Sampler to improve the feasibility of the generated subgoals by minimizing the deviation between them and subgoals sampled from an offline dataset.

3. It utilizes a Value Selector to select optimal subgoals from the candidates using the state value function.

4. It conducts simulations and real-world experiments on several long-horizon tasks including locomotion and manipulation, showing that the proposed method outperforms other approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is a new algorithm called VAESI that can generate feasible and optimal subgoals to solve long-horizon sparse reward tasks by leveraging VAE, hindsight sampling, and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Both quantitative results and real robot demonstrations validate the effectiveness of this method.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Long-horizon tasks - The paper focuses on enabling robots to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks that require long-term planning and reasoning.

- Subgoal inference - A core aspect of the paper is using variational autoencoders to incrementally infer feasible and optimal subgoals that divide a long-horizon task into simpler subtasks. 

- Feasibility and optimality - The paper quantifies the quality of inferred subgoals along these two dimensions, aiming to generate subgoals that are reachable and maximize cumulative reward.

- Variational autoencoder (VAE) - The method uses a VAE as the backbone for the subgoal generator, with an explicit encoder to produce subgoals and implicit decoder to refine them. 

- Hindsight sampling - A technique proposed to sample achieved goals from past experience to improve subgoal feasibility. 

- Value selector - Uses a state value function to select the most promising subgoal candidates for execution.

- Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning - The overall approach incorporates subgoal inference with goal-conditioned RL to actually accomplish the subtasks.

Some other keywords: divide-and-conquer, incremental planning, manipulation, locomotion, sparse rewards.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using both an explicit encoder model and an implicit decoder model for subgoal generation. What is the intuition behind using this combination of models? What are the benefits of having both types of models?

2. The Hindsight Sampler is used to ensure the feasibility of the generated subgoals. How exactly does it work to sample valid subgoals from the experience replay buffer? Why is this an effective approach?

3. The paper claims the Hindsight Sampler allows approximating the true distribution of valid subgoals. What is the theoretical justification for this? How good of an approximation can it provide?

4. The Value Selector uses the state value function to choose the optimal subgoal from the candidates. What properties of the value function make it suitable for this selection? Are there any potential downsides? 

5. The overall loss function combines the VAE reconstruction loss and the Hindsight Sampler log likelihood loss. What is the reasoning behind combining these two losses? How do they complement each other?

6. The method is integrated with an off-policy RL algorithm (SAC). What modifications need to be made to SAC's implementation to incorporate the proposed subgoal generation method?

7. The paper demonstrates results on both simulated and real-world robotic tasks. What additional challenges arise when transferring the method to real-world settings? How are these challenges addressed?

8. In the failed cases analysis, what causes subgoals to be generated that are too close or too far from the current state? How could the method be improved to avoid these failure cases?

9. How does the incremental generation of subgoals provide more robustness over methods that generate all subgoals initially? What enables the incremental planning of subgoals?

10. The proposed method combines ideas from variational autoencoders, hindsight experience replay, and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. What is the intuition behind blending these different techniques? Are there any alternatives you can think of?
