# [Implicit Subgoal Planning with Variational Autoencoders for Long-Horizon   Sparse Reward Robotic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Long-horizon tasks in robotics remain challenging due to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards in traditional reinforcement learning approaches. Humans can infer subgoals and reason about the final goal in the context of subgoals to accomplish long-horizon tasks effectively. However, current methods for robotic subgoal planning require explicit specification of the number of subgoals upfront or rely solely on an explicit model to infer subgoals.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Variational Autoencoder-based Subgoal Inference (VAESI), a novel algorithm to accomplish long-horizon tasks through incremental subgoal planning. VAESI has three key components:

1) VAE-based Subgoal Generator: Employs an explicit encoder to generate subgoals conditioned on current state and final goal. Also uses an implicit decoder model to reconstruct the final goal from current state and subgoal to enhance subgoal quality. 

2) Hindsight Sampler: Selects valid historical subgoals from experience replay buffer to guide the generator to produce feasible subgoals.

3) Value Selector: Ranks subgoal candidates using value function to filter optimal subgoals.

By combining explicit and implicit models for subgoal reasoning, ensuring feasibility through hindsight sampling, and optimality via value selection, VAESI can effectively divide-and-conquer long-horizon tasks.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel VAE-based subgoal generator with explicit encoder and implicit decoder to enhance subgoal inference.

2) Hindsight Sampler utilizing offline data to improve subgoal feasibility. 

3) Value Selector to filter optimal subgoals from candidates.

4) Promising performance over baselines on 1 locomotion and 3 manipulation tasks in simulation and real-world.

The algorithm represents an effective framework for long-horizon robotic task planning through incremental abstraction of subgoals. Key novelty lies in the hybrid explicit-implicit model for subgoal reasoning and techniques to ensure quality subgoals.
