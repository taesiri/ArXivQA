# [Experimental Insights Towards Explainable and Interpretable Pedestrian   Crossing Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02872)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for an explainable and interpretable pedestrian crossing predictor (ExPedCross) based on fuzzy logic and deep learning. The approach involves extracting explainable features from pedestrian datasets, using fuzzy rule mining to generate rules, defining a fuzzy inference system, and making predictions that can be interpreted through the activation of rules. Experiments were conducted using the JAAD and PIE datasets to evaluate factors like data quantity and quality, feature importance, and cross-dataset testing. Key insights include that more data does not necessarily improve fuzzy rule generalization, careful video selection and data filtering enable meaningful rule creation, pedestrian proximity, orientation and distance are influential features, and divergent feature representations across datasets can hinder performance. Guidelines are provided regarding judicious dataset selection and preprocessing, grouping complementary features, and handling dataset differences during feature selection. While results are promising, future work involves exploring more complex strategies and incorporating temporal features to enhance explainability.
