# [Experimental Insights Towards Explainable and Interpretable Pedestrian   Crossing Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pedestrian crossing prediction is critical for autonomous vehicles to improve road safety. However, most models lack explainability and interpretability. 
- There is a need for approaches that provide both accurate predictions as well as explanations for those predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach called ExPedCross that combines deep learning and fuzzy logic to create an explainable and interpretable pedestrian crossing predictor. 

- The model utilizes explainable features extracted from pedestrian datasets like JAAD and PIE. These features include proximity to road, body orientation, gaze, action, etc.

- Fuzzy rule learning is applied on the features to generate if-then rules that are used to define a fuzzy inference system for making crossing predictions.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach for explainable pedestrian crossing prediction using deep learning and fuzzy logic.

- Analysis of multiple factors like dataset quantity, selection, randomness, ablation and mixing that impact performance of the explainable predictor.

- Formulation of guidelines and recommendations regarding dataset selection, feature selection and explainability for pedestrian crossing predictors.

- Experimental evaluation showing comparable performance to state-of-the-art while also providing interpretability through most activated fuzzy rules for each prediction.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in pedestrian crossing prediction by not just focusing on accuracy but also on model explainability through its unique neuro-symbolic approach.
