# [CoRaiS: Lightweight Real-Time Scheduler for Multi-Edge Cooperative   Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Multi-edge computing systems combine resources from multiple network edges to provide improved computing power and response time. However, modeling and scheduling tasks across heterogeneous edges is challenging due to:
	1) Diverse hardware configurations and resource allocations at edges
	2) Difficulty in estimating computation requirements of requests, especially for blackbox services
	3) Unpredictable request arrival patterns from multiple clients
- Existing works make simplifying assumptions about hardware, computation requirements, and arrival patterns that limit applicability.

Proposed Solution:
- A system-level state evaluation model to consistently represent service capacity across edges by estimating:
	1) Computation time functions relating response time to data size
	2) Number of service replicas at each edge 
- A workload evaluation method using queue models to capture real-time edge workload
- An integer linear programming formulation to minimize overall response time across edges
- A lightweight neural scheduler called CoRaiS that: 
	1) Learns system-level embeddings of edges and requests
	2) Predicts scheduling policy via multi-head attention to match demands and capacity  
	3) Uses batch reinforcement learning to optimize for minimum response time
	
Main Contributions:
- System-level modeling to capture edge performance and workload while abstracting hardware details
- New problem formulation to guide multi-edge scheduling algorithm design
- Lightweight neural scheduler CoRaiS that provides high-quality scheduling solutions in real-time, irrespective of system scale and request patterns
- Experiments showing CoRaiS matches performance of optimal solver, generalizes to larger systems, and learns to balance load, perceive state, and recognize heterogeneity

In summary, the paper addresses key challenges in heterogeneous multi-edge scheduling through innovative modeling, formulation and an efficient learned scheduling policy able to operate in real-time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a system-level state evaluation model to capture heterogeneous edge features, an integer linear programming formulation to reveal the essence of multi-edge scheduling, and a lightweight reinforcement learning-based real-time scheduler, CoRaiS, to minimize the response time over distributed requests in multi-edge computing systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. A system-level state evaluation model is built to capture important features across edges, including service-oriented performance feature and workload feature. This helps shield the heterogeneity of edges and unify the modeling.

2. A new integer linear programming formulation is presented for the multi-edge cooperative scheduling problem. This provides a good starting point to guide the design and optimization of scheduling algorithms. 

3. A lightweight attention-based scheduler called CoRaiS is proposed to minimize the response time over all distributed arriving requests in the multi-edge system. It can provide high-quality near-optimal solutions in real time, regardless of request arrival patterns and system scales.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the CoRaiS scheduler that can effectively schedule tasks over heterogeneous edges in multi-edge computing systems to minimize overall response time. The system-level modeling and problem formulation also help enable the design of CoRaiS.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a system-level state evaluation model to capture important features related to scheduling across heterogeneous edges. What are the key components of this model and how do they help simplify the scheduling process?

2. The paper formulates the multi-edge scheduling problem as an integer linear programming model. What are the key decision variables, objective function and constraints in this formulation? How does it connect to the system-level state evaluation model?

3. The proposed scheduler CoRaiS adopts a matching-on-demand architecture with alignment modules and a matching module. Explain the roles of these components and how they work together to generate scheduling decisions. 

4. CoRaiS leverages multi-head self-attention in its alignment modules. Why is attention used here rather than other mechanisms like RNNs or CNNs? What are the benefits?

5. The paper trains CoRaiS using synthetic data instead of real-world traces. What is the rationale behind this? What strategies can be used to improve the diversity and representativeness of the synthetic data?

6. CoRaiS is optimized using batch reinforcement learning based on a custom global reward function. Walk through the key equations used to compute this reward. How does it connect back to the problem formulation?

7. The experiments compare CoRaiS against baselines using an exact solver, heuristics and ablation models. Analyze the results - what are the key strengths and limitations of each approach?

8. The results show CoRaiS can generalize to larger problem scales than it was trained on. Why does it have this capability? Are there ways to further improve generalization? 

9. Characteristic validation experiments are conducted to assess if CoRaiS can balance load, perceive state and recognize heterogeneity. Propose additional validation experiments along these lines.

10. This scheduler focuses on ideal services with a linear relationship between runtime and data size. Discuss how the method could be extended to other types of services, along with associated challenges.
