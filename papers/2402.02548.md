# ["What's my model inside of?": Exploring the role of environments for   grounded natural language understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02548)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an interactive game approach for extracting structured action graphs from procedural texts, using text-based games as lab simulators to support annotated data collection and model training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new conceptual framework and computational formulation for grounded natural language understanding systems. Specifically:

1) The paper synthesizes research from cognitive science, linguistics, and reinforcement learning to propose an "ecological" perspective on natural language understanding. This perspective foregrounds the role of environments, in contrast to mainstream NLU research which focuses mainly on models in isolation. 

2) The paper puts forward a new "embodied language model" which extends the standard language modeling formulation. Whereas standard language models only account for statistical patterns in language, the embodied model additionally incorporates the mental models of communicators. This provides a more realistic computational account of how language acquires meaning in relation to external environments.

3) The embodied language model enables connecting NLU research to work on world models and model-based reinforcement learning. Understanding is construed as a "meeting of minds" between speaker and listener, mediated by their mental models which are learned through interaction with an environment. 

4) The paper outlines a research roadmap for empirical work on grounded NLU systems, including creation of interactive training environments and evaluating the world-modeling capabilities of models situated within those environments.

In summary, the main contribution is an ecological perspective on NLU highlighting the pivotal yet underappreciated role of environments, instantiated in a new conceptual framework and computational formulation for grounded language understanding systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Environments - The paper argues for taking an "ecological" perspective in natural language understanding research that focuses more on the environments that language models interact with, rather than just the models themselves. Environments are seen as crucial for grounding language in meaning.

- Embodied cognition - The paper draws on theories of embodied cognition from cognitive science that emphasize the important role of the body and environment in shaping cognition and language. This is contrasted with more abstract, symbolic approaches.

- Symbol grounding - The symbol grounding problem, related to how symbols like words get meaning, is discussed in relation to the role of environments in grounding language.

- Mental models/world models - The paper proposes extending standard statistical language models to "embodied language models" that also represent the mental models of speakers and listeners. It relates this to world models in reinforcement learning. 

- Procedural text understanding - The paper empirically explores procedural texts as an testbed for grounded language understanding, since procedures refer to actions in environments.

- Text-based games - Interactive text-based games are proposed as useful environments for training and evaluating grounded language understanding systems.

- Annotation environments - The use of text-based games as annotation environments is demonstrated to enable richer process-level representation compared to standard span-based annotation.

- Benchmarking - The paper examines benchmarking of world modeling capabilities of language models using a text-based game environment. Issues with existing benchmarks are discussed.

- Breakpoint modelling - A method is introduced to enable tracking of intermediate world states in language models to improve world modelling.

- Collective sensemaking - The final chapter explores the application of environment-oriented principles for designing better online environments for human social learning and collective intelligence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "embodied language model" that incorporates mental models of communicators beyond just the linguistic signals. How is this embodied language model formulated computationally? What are the key components and how do they interact?

2. The paper discusses grounding language in an agent's perceptions, actions, and interactions with an external world. What specific mechanisms does the proposed approach use to ground language in these elements? How is the grounding evaluated?

3. The paper proposes that understanding involves a "meeting of the minds" between speaker and listener. What does this entail technically? How are the mental models of speaker and listener represented and how is agreement or shared understanding defined and measured? 

4. The paper advocates situating language in an interactive, agent-based context. What specific interactive capabilities or affordances does the proposed approach provide over standard language models? How do these affordances support or demonstrate greater language understanding?

5. The paper identifies "environment bottlenecks" as a key limitation in NLU research. What specific bottlenecks does the paper identify and how does the proposed approach aim to address them? What remaining bottlenecks persist?

6. The paper discusses leveraging ideas from model-based reinforcement learning for representing world models. How are world models from RL adapted to the language setting? What modifications or additions are made? How is the world model learned or updated during language interaction?

7. What specific evaluation benchmarks or tasks are used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed embodied language model? What results are achieved compared to baseline approaches? What are the limitations of the evaluation setting?

8. The paper proposes TextLabs as a way to situate procedural text understanding in an interactive game environment. What textual phenomena can be captured in TextLabs that are missed by standard approaches? How is the environment used during training and evaluation?

9. The paper advocates agent-based dialogue systems. What additional challenges arise in this interactive setting compared to standard language modelling? How does the proposed approach address challenges like maintaining consistent world state over long conversations?

10. The paper touches on social, collective sensemaking environments. What propositions are made in this direction? What role could agent-based modelling play in designing online environments to support reliable social learning and mitigate issues like polarization?
