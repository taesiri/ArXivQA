## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes StarVector, a novel method for generating high-quality and complex Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) code from input images. 

Problem: Existing deep learning methods for SVG modeling struggle to generate complex and unrestricted SVGs, often relying on simplifications and restricting the output to just path commands. Recent image-to-image diffusion models can produce SVGs via optimization but are slow and iterative. There is a need for models that can directly generate full-fledged SVG code comprising diverse primitives.

Proposed Solution: StarVector is a multimodal code generation language model that effectively integrates vision and language modalities. It utilizes a CLIP image encoder to obtain visual representations from input images. These are transformed into "visual tokens" via an adapter module and used to condition a pre-trained StarCoder model to generate SVG code in an autoregressive text generation fashion. 

Key Outcomes:
- Introduces SVG-Bench, a benchmark for SVG methods with new datasets (SVG-Emoji, SVG-Stack) and evaluation metrics spanning pixel, vector and perceptual similarities.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of StarVector on image-to-SVG generation across datasets. Significantly outperforms prior deep learning baselines and is comparable to traditional graphics algorithms.

- Showcases remarkable capabilities in generating aesthetically appealing and functionally correct SVG designs comprising complex syntax and diverse primitives.

- Provides strong evidence for the efficacy of formulating SVG modeling as an image-conditioned text generation problem by leveraging recent advances in language models.

- Opens up new possibilities for building next-gen vector graphics systems powered by foundations models pre-trained for multimodal SVG understanding tasks.

The paper makes notable advancements in deep generative modeling research for vector graphics and offers StarVector as an effective solution for image-to-SVG generation.
