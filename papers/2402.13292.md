# [A Conflict-Aware Optimal Goal Assignment Algorithm for Multi-Robot   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the fundamental multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem, where given a set of robots with designated start locations and a set of goal locations, the aim is to assign a unique goal to each robot such that the paths are collision-free and optimize certain objectives like total travel cost. Solving this problem optimally is computationally intractable and hence developing a scalable optimal algorithm remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel optimal MAPF algorithm based on an iterative process that integrates a task assignment module and a path planning module (CBS). It introduces three key optimizations:

1) Conflict-Aware Assignment Computation: It efficiently computes the next best assignment on demand by tracking robot-goal path conflicts and using them to formulate constraints to postpone assignment computations that are guaranteed to increase cost.

2) Distance-Based Assignment Computation: It avoids exhaustive computation of all robot-goal paths by using only heuristic distances where possible.

3) Path Memoization: It caches constrained paths computed by CBS for reuse instead of recomputing.

Together, these techniques help focus the search and avoid duplicate computations.

Main Contributions:
- A scalable optimal algorithm for MAPF that outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by nearly an order of magnitude
- A novel conflict-guided approach to efficiently compute next best assignments 
- Optimizations like path memoization and demand-driven assignment computation to improve performance

The algorithm scales significantly better than baseline with number of robots, workspace size etc. Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmarks with up to 100 robots demonstrates its efficacy. The modular design allows extending it to optimize other objectives like makespan as well.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable algorithm for optimal multi-robot goal assignment that efficiently computes the next best assignments by learning from and avoiding known conflicts, while also introducing path memoization and reducing redundant path computations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient conflict-guided method to compute the next best assignment in order to achieve scalability in solving the multi-robot goal assignment problem optimally. Specifically, the paper:

1) Presents a conflict-aware assignment computation mechanism that uses the accumulated conflicts to formulate constraints and postpone the computation of assignments containing conflicting robot-goal pairs until there is a possibility of lower cost assignments. 

2) Incorporates a heuristic distance-based assignment computation method to avoid exhaustive computation of all robot-goal paths.

3) Introduces a path memoization technique to prevent duplicate constrained path computations.

Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that the proposed approach incorporating all these techniques achieves nearly an order of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art algorithm and scales well up to 100 robots. The ablation study also confirms that all three proposed optimizations contribute significantly to the overall performance improvement.
