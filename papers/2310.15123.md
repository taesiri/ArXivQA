# [Branch-Solve-Merge Improves Large Language Model Evaluation and   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15123)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve the performance of large language models on complex multi-faceted natural language tasks like evaluation and constrained generation. Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "Branch-Solve-Merge" (BSM) to decompose such complex tasks into multiple parallel sub-tasks that can be solved independently and then merged together. 

The key hypothesis is that explicitly decomposing a complex task into distinct components that can be solved separately will allow large language models to perform better on tasks that require planning, coherence, and satisfying multiple constraints or objectives. The BSM method aims to provide a framework for task decomposition that can improve the capabilities of LLMs on challenging generation and evaluation tasks.

The two main case studies explored in the paper are:

1) Using BSM to improve large language model evaluation of other model outputs by branching to evaluate different aspects/criteria separately and then merging the evaluations. This aims to improve correctness through better human agreement and consistency by reducing biases.

2) Applying BSM to constrained text generation by branching the concepts into subsets, generating partial stories satisfying those concept subsets, and then merging the partial stories. This aims to improve coherence while better satisfying constraints.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly decomposing tasks will allow LLMs to better handle complex multi-objective language tasks, which the paper tests through BSM's application to LLM evaluation and constrained generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM), a method for improving large language models (LLMs) on complex natural language tasks that require planning and meeting multiple objectives. 

Specifically, BSM breaks down a complex task into multiple parallel subtasks using a "branch" module, solves each subtask independently using a "solve" module, and combines the solutions using a "merge" module. The key benefits are:

- Improved performance on tasks like LLM response evaluation and constrained text generation, where LLMs struggle due to lack of planning and consistency. BSM improves correctness, reduces biases, and improves constraint satisfaction.

- Generalizable framework that can work with any underlying LLM. BSM is framed as an LLM program that invokes specialized prompts for the branch, solve, and merge modules.

- Enables task decomposition and parallel solving. By branching into independent subtasks, BSM allows dividing a complex problem into simpler parts that can be solved separately.

- Flexible method where the LLM decides the decomposition plan based on the input. The number and nature of branches are generated on the fly by the model.

- Improves existing LLMs like GPT-4 without changing the base model. BSM provides gains even when applied on top of state-of-the-art LLMs.

In summary, the key novelty is using a decompose-solve-merge approach specifically designed for improving LLMs on planning-based language tasks, demonstrated via comprehensive experiments on LLM evaluation and constrained text generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:

- Task: This paper focuses on improving large language model (LLM) evaluation and constrained text generation through a decomposition-based approach called Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM). Other related works have looked at improving LLMs for reasoning tasks, iterative refinement, and constraint satisfaction. So this paper tackles novel tasks compared to prior work.

- Method: BSM is framed as an LLM program with branch, solve, and merge modules. It enables decomposing complex tasks into parallel sub-problems. This is a unique approach compared to methods like prompting strategies, self-consistency, or debate frameworks used in other works. The modular and programmatic nature of BSM allows it to generalize across tasks and models.

- Evaluation: The paper conducts rigorous experiments spanning multiple LLMs like Vicuna, LLaMA, and GPT-4. It reports improvements across metrics like human agreement, bias reduction for evaluation, and constraint satisfaction for generation. This level of thorough evaluation on large models distinguishes the paper from related works that tend to focus on smaller models.

- Results: BSM obtains significant gains over baselines in LLM evaluation correctness and consistency. It also improves constrained text generation. For example, it achieves over 25% absolute gains in human agreement for LLaMA models, reducing the gap with GPT-4. These results demonstrate broader capabilities beyond what existing methods have shown.

- Impact: By tackling new tasks and models, proposing a generalizable approach, conducting comprehensive evaluations, and achieving strong improvements, this paper makes important contributions. The BSM framework could become a standard technique for enhancing LLMs on complex decomposition-based tasks. The gains also showcase possibilities for improving reliability of LLMs as evaluators.

In summary, through its novelty, generalizability, rigor, and impact, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in improving LLMs for challenging language tasks compared to related work. The BSM approach could be built upon to further advance research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing recursive or iterative versions of Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM) that involve repeatedly branching the problem into smaller sub-problems. The authors mention that constraint satisfaction in constrained text generation could potentially be further improved through a "recursive BSM" approach, though this would involve more computational cost due to additional calls to the underlying language model.

- Exploring different module architectures and implementations beyond the simple zero-shot prompting used in this work. For example, the branch, solve, and merge modules could be fine-tuned separately. This could potentially improve the performance of BSM.

- Applying BSM to a wider range of natural language tasks beyond just language model evaluation and constrained text generation. The authors frame BSM as a general purpose technique so it would be interesting to see it applied to other language tasks that require decomposition and planning.

- Developing methods to automatically determine the optimal branching factor based on the input instead of having to specify a fixed maximum branching factor. The number of sub-problems needed likely varies per input.

- Combining BSM with other techniques like self-consistency that introduce diversity during inference. The authors showed combining self-consistency within each BSM branch further reduced position bias.

- Evaluating whether BSM leads to improved sample efficiency and/or computational efficiency in addition to improved performance. The authors do not analyze computational cost.

- Comparing BSM to other decomposition approaches like graph-of-thoughts prompting. The relationship between these methods could be studied.

In summary, the authors propose many promising directions to build upon BSM and further improve and analyze decomposition methods for complex language tasks. Iterative BSM, broader applications, adaptive branching factors, and hybrid methods seem especially interesting areas for future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM), a method for improving large language model (LLM) evaluation and generation. BSM consists of three modules - branch, solve, and merge - that are parameterized with prompts to decompose a complex task into sub-tasks, independently solve the sub-tasks, and merge the solutions. BSM is applied to two challenging natural language tasks that require satisfying multiple constraints or criteria: LLM response evaluation and constrained text generation. For LLM response evaluation, BSM generates an evaluation plan consisting of different criteria (via the branch module), evaluates responses per criterion (solve), and combines judgments (merge). This improves correctness by enhancing human-LLM agreement and consistency by reducing biases. BSM allows smaller LLMs like LLaMA-2-70B to match/exceed GPT-4 performance. For constrained story generation, BSM divides concepts into subsets (branch), generates intermediate coherent stories per subset (solve), and merges them (merge). This improves coherence and constraint satisfaction over standard prompting. Experiments with multiple LLMs validate BSM's effectiveness.

In summary, the key ideas are: 1) BSM is a decomposition method for multi-faceted NLP tasks, consisting of branch, solve, and merge modules. 2) It improves two challenging tasks - LLM response evaluation (by enhancing correctness and consistency) and constrained text generation (by improving coherence and constraint satisfaction). 3) BSM is model-agnostic and improves smaller and larger LLMs. The results demonstrate BSM's effectiveness as a general framework for planning and task decomposition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM), a decomposition-based method for improving large language models (LLMs) on multi-faceted natural language tasks. BSM consists of three modules - branch, solve, and merge - that are parameterized as prompts to an underlying LLM. On a given task, the branch module decomposes the problem into multiple parallel sub-problems. The solve module independently solves each sub-problem. Finally, the merge module aggregates the solutions to the sub-problems to generate the overall solution. The authors demonstrate BSM on two case studies - evaluating LLM responses and constrained text generation. For LLM response evaluation, the branch module generates an evaluation plan with different criteria, the solve module scores the responses on each criterion, and merge combines the scores into an overall judgement. For constrained generation, branch divides concepts into subsets, solve generates intermediate stories with a subset of concepts, and merge combines them into a final story. Experiments show BSM improves LLM evaluation correctness and consistency, and generates more coherent and constraint-satisfying stories.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenges of using large language models (LLMs) for multi-faceted natural language tasks that require satisfying intricate constraints or taking into account multiple aspects/criteria. The authors argue that LLMs struggle with such tasks due to a lack of coherence and inability to plan or decompose the problem. 

Specifically, the paper focuses on two challenging tasks where LLMs are commonly used but their performance lags behind humans:

1. Evaluation of LLM Outputs: Evaluating LLMs holistically is difficult due to the need to assess long-form answers to arbitrary questions, reliability issues like biases, and reliance on hand-designed evaluation plans.

2. Constrained Text Generation: LLMs struggle to generate coherent text while satisfying constraints like including certain concepts. Models tend to either violate constraints or generate incoherent text.

The key research problem is developing methods to improve LLM performance on these kinds of complex, multi-faceted language tasks that require satisfying intricate constraints or multi-dimensional objectives.
