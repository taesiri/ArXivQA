# [Deep Learning for Code Intelligence: Survey, Benchmark and Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the lack of standardized implementations and benchmarks for evaluating deep learning models for code intelligence. Code intelligence leverages machine learning to extract knowledge from large codebases to develop intelligent programming tools. However, reproducing results of code intelligence models is difficult due to sensitivity to data and hyperparameters. Also, there is a lack of benchmarks for fair comparison of different models.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop an open-source toolkit called NaturalCC for evaluating code intelligence models. The toolkit enables easy implementation and evaluation of models by providing shared components like data preprocessing, encoders for code representation, implementations of downstream tasks like code summarization and search, and corresponding evaluation metrics. The authors also benchmark performance of leading models on tasks like code summarization, search, completion and type inference to enable fair comparisons.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive literature review of deep learning for code intelligence covering areas like code representation learning, techniques and applications
- Development of open-source NaturalCC toolkit with state-of-the-art model implementations for rapid prototyping and reproducible research  
- Extensive benchmarking of models across code summarization, search, completion and type inference providing standardized comparison
- Identification of challenges and future opportunities like robust and multilingual models, data quality and model interpretability

In summary, the paper significantly advances code intelligence research by providing an open-source toolkit, extensive benchmarking and insights into future challenges for the community. The standardized implementations and comparisons will greatly benefit advancements in this emerging field.
