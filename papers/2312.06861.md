## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, which consists of a long list of reader comments from news articles, there do not seem to be any clear key terms or keywords that summarize the content. The comments cover a very wide range of topics related to politics, religion, gender, race, terrorism, and more. Some topics that come up frequently across the comments include:

- Politics (Trump, Clinton, Obama, Trudeau, Harper, etc.)

- Religion (Christianity, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism)  

- Gender and sexuality (transgender issues, gay rights, women's rights)

- Race relations 

- Terrorism and national security

However, there is no clear focus or common theme tying all the comments together. They seem to be a randomly selected set of reader comments responding to various news articles that touch on controversial societal issues. So there does not seem to be any key terms or keywords that represent the content as a whole. It is an eclectic mix of reader reactions and opinions on various news topics.
