# [Deployment Prior Injection for Run-time Calibratable Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Object detectors often learn context priors (e.g. object relationships) from the training data distribution. While useful when test data matches training, it becomes a harmful bias when test distributions shift over time/location. Existing detectors lack the flexibility to leverage or mitigate context priors at runtime without parameter updates.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a "calibratable object detector" that allows injecting deployment context priors at runtime to adapt to shifted distributions, without retraining. 

It exposes an explicit graph structure from the detector where nodes are object classes and directed edges represent inter-class conditional probabilities (object relationships). The detector behavior is trained to align with this graph structure.  

At runtime, deployment priors can be injected by editing the graph edges, allowing the detector to calibrate towards specific distributions. If no explicit prior is given, the detector can self-calibrate using its own predictions to approximate the deployment distribution.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes the first object detector that allows runtime calibration to known or approximated deployment priors without retraining
- Introduces an explicit graph-based representation of inter-class relationships from the detector
- Develops a model architecture and modified training process to bind detector behavior to the graph structure
- Demonstrates effectiveness of runtime calibration towards specific distributions, and detector self-calibration in the absence of explicit priors

The flexible runtime calibration capabilities enable the detector to adapt to varied distributions across locations and time with no parameter updates. Evaluations on COCO and Objects365 datasets validate these model capabilities.
