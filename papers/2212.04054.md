# [Learning to Dub Movies via Hierarchical Prosody Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04054)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper text, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop a movie dubbing system that generates speech with proper prosody and emotion to match a given video, while also synchronizing the generated speech with the lip movements in the video?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Modeling prosody and emotion from visual cues in the video (lips, facial expressions, scenes) can help generate speech that matches the emotion and mood of the video's visual content. 

2) Aligning the generated speech duration and rhythm with the lip movements in the video is important for creating natural, synchronized dubbing.

3) Using dimensional emotion representations like arousal and valence extracted from facial expressions can help convey fine-grained emotional expressions in the generated speech. 

4) Incorporating global scene understanding can provide additional context to model the overall atmosphere and emotion of a video scene.

So in summary, the central research direction is using multi-level visual cues from video to model emotion, prosody, and synchronization for high-quality movie dubbing. The key hypotheses focus on leveraging lips, facial expressions, and scenes as inputs to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel movie dubbing architecture to synthesize speech with proper prosody by associating speech attributes with visual counterparts at multiple levels - lips, facial expressions, and surrounding scenes. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- A hierarchical modular network is proposed for movie dubbing, which consists of three main components:

1) Duration Aligner: It aligns phonemes to lip motions via multi-head attention to control speech speed.

2) Prosody Adaptor: It predicts pitch and energy from facial arousal and valence respectively to convey emotion. 

3) Scene Atmosphere Booster: It captures global emotion from video scenes.

- An affective display-based Prosody Adaptor is designed to estimate speech energy and pitch from arousal and valence fluctuations in facial regions. This provides fine-grained alignment to speakers' emotions.

- Extensive experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets V2C and Chem.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a hierarchical architecture that models speech prosody at multiple levels based on visual cues to achieve high-quality and emotionally-appropriate dubbing for movies. The novel Prosody Adaptor based on affective display is critical for conveying fine-grained emotions.
