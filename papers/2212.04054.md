# [Learning to Dub Movies via Hierarchical Prosody Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04054)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper text, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop a movie dubbing system that generates speech with proper prosody and emotion to match a given video, while also synchronizing the generated speech with the lip movements in the video?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Modeling prosody and emotion from visual cues in the video (lips, facial expressions, scenes) can help generate speech that matches the emotion and mood of the video's visual content. 

2) Aligning the generated speech duration and rhythm with the lip movements in the video is important for creating natural, synchronized dubbing.

3) Using dimensional emotion representations like arousal and valence extracted from facial expressions can help convey fine-grained emotional expressions in the generated speech. 

4) Incorporating global scene understanding can provide additional context to model the overall atmosphere and emotion of a video scene.

So in summary, the central research direction is using multi-level visual cues from video to model emotion, prosody, and synchronization for high-quality movie dubbing. The key hypotheses focus on leveraging lips, facial expressions, and scenes as inputs to achieve this goal.
