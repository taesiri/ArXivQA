# [A First Look at GPT Apps: Landscape and Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are increasingly being used to create sophisticated applications called GPTs. However, the LLM ecosystem remains largely unexplored.  
- LLMs are susceptible to attacks, raising concerns about the safety and integrity of GPT applications.

Goal:  
- Conduct the first large-scale analysis of two GPT app stores - the unofficial GPTStore.AI and the official OpenAI GPT Store - to study vulnerabilities and plagiarism issues.

Methodology:
- Developed automated tools for web scraping and interacting with GPTs.  
- Proposed a TriLevel GPT Reversing (T-GR) strategy to extract GPT internals (prompts, files, APIs) from the top 10,000 GPTs on GPTStore.AI.
- Accumulated comprehensive datasets through longitudinal tracking of stores and reverse engineering popular GPTs.

Key Findings:
- Rapid growth in GPTs (92,000+) and creators (26,000+), indicating strong demand. But stores need better organization.
- Widespread failure to protect GPT internals - nearly 90% of prompts easily accessible. Enables plagiarism.  
- Over 9% of GPTs have duplicated/similar versions. Undermines integrity.
- Accessing proprietary APIs remains challenging due to authentication.

Main Contributions:  
- First large-scale measurement study of the GPT app ecosystem and analysis of GPT vulnerabilities.
- Automated tools for tracking stores and interacting with GPTs.
- Novel T-GR strategy for acquiring GPT internals at scale.
- Guidance for improving protection of intellectual property for GPT creators and stores.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents the first large-scale analysis of two GPT stores to study vulnerabilities and plagiarism issues, reveals widespread failure to secure system prompts leading to extensive duplication, and recommends rethinking protection strategies and anti-attack mechanisms to safeguard intellectual property.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors conduct the first large-scale monitoring and analysis of two GPT stores and the first to study GPT plagiarism issues. 

2. They design automated tools for web page capture and programmatic interactions with GPTs. They also propose a novel TriLevel GPT Reversing (T-GR) approach to acquire the GPT internals.

3. They accumulate a comprehensive dataset with two main components: (a) a two-month longitudinal analysis of web information from GPTStore.AI and the OpenAI GPT Store; and (b) in-depth insights obtained through the reverse engineering of the top 10,000 GPTs. Tools and datasets will be made publicly available upon the publication of their paper.

So in summary, the key contributions are the large-scale analysis and measurement of GPT stores, the development of automated tools, the proposal of a novel GPT reverse engineering methodology, and the compilation of detailed datasets. This provides valuable insights into the emerging GPT app ecosystem.

The paper conducts a large-scale measurement study on two GPT stores - GPTStore.AI and the OpenAI GPT Store. It analyzes the landscape and growth trends of GPTs in these stores. The paper also examines the vulnerability of GPTs by reverse engineering their system prompts, knowledge files, and APIs. It uncovers issues like widespread GPT duplication and plagiarism due to the failure to protect GPT internals. The paper proposes recommendations for improving protection mechanisms and user experience in GPT stores.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an automated TriLevel GPT Reversing (T-GR) strategy for extracting GPT internals. Could you elaborate on why a three-level approach was chosen instead of a simpler one-level or two-level method? What are the advantages of having three levels?

2. Level I of the T-GR strategy attempts direct queries to access GPT internals. What types of queries were used for system prompts, files, and APIs respectively? Were these query templates pre-defined or dynamically generated?  

3. For the GPTs that could not be reversed in Level I, how was the decision made on whether to transfer them to Level II or directly to Level III? What failure criteria determined this?

4. Level II repeats the same procedures as Level I. What is the rationale behind this repetition? Does it help improve the success rate in any way compared to only attempting queries once?

5. The paper states that Level III requires GPT replication via multiple languages while ensuring consistent functionality. Exactly what languages were chosen and why those specific ones? 

6. The validation strategy for extracted GPT internals involves replicating a GPT and comparing responses to identical input queries. What similarity metric was used to quantify the correspondence between responses? Why was this metric selected?

7. The findings show nearly 90% of system prompts were easily accessible. Does this indicate a lack of awareness among creators to actively protect GPT internals? Or are there limitations in the protection mechanisms available currently?

8. For the knowledge files and APIs that could not be accessed easily, what barriers existed that prevented retrieving further details? Are there any commonalities observed in how these were protected?

9. The paper examines GPT plagiarism caused due to easily accessible internals. Apart from similarities in names/descriptions, what other dimensions were analyzed to identify duplicated GPTs? 

10. One recommendation is to segregate private/critical data within APIs instead of prompts. How feasible would this be? Would it require changes in how GPTs are architected currently? What would be the downsides?
