# [On Calibration and Conformal Prediction of Deep Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
Modern deep neural network (DNN) classifiers are often miscalibrated, meaning their predicted confidence scores do not match the true likelihood of being correct. Two popular approaches to address this are: (1) calibration methods like temperature scaling (TS) that adjust the DNN's outputs to better estimate the correctness probability, and (2) conformal prediction (CP) methods that produce prediction sets with marginal coverage guarantees. This paper investigates the interplay between these approaches, which has not been previously studied.  

Proposed Solution and Contributions
The authors conduct an extensive empirical study applying TS and three CP methods - LAC, APS, and RAPS - on various dataset-model pairs. The key findings are:

1) TS slightly improves the conditional coverage of APS and RAPS but generally does not affect LAC. 

2) Surprisingly, TS has a detrimental effect on the prediction set sizes of APS and RAPS, especially for less accurate models. The authors show this is not caused by outliers.

3) Increasing the temperature T monotonically decreases the threshold values of APS and RAPS.

They then provide theoretical analysis revealing properties of the procedures to explain the empirical phenomena, focused on the negative impact of TS on APS and RAPS:

1) TS affects coverage only through misclassified samples. 

2) TS provably reduces APS/RAPS thresholds for any Tâ‰¥1.

3) Local analysis shows for typical cases, TS distorts scores of APS/RAPS more significantly than the hard examples determining the thresholds.

The key conclusion is that adaptive CP methods may benefit from operating on pre-TS softmax scores. This challenges the standard practice of calibrating DNNs before applying other algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper empirically and theoretically studies the effect of temperature scaling calibration on conformal prediction methods for deep neural network classifiers, showing it can negatively impact the prediction set sizes of adaptive conformal prediction techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is studying the interplay between temperature scaling (TS) calibration and conformal prediction (CP) methods when applied to deep neural network classifiers. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- An extensive empirical study showing that TS calibration affects CP methods differently - it tends to have a detrimental effect by increasing the prediction set sizes of adaptive CP methods like APS and RAPS, especially for less accurate models.

- A theoretical analysis studying the tension between TS and the procedures of APS/RAPS, revealing mathematical properties and providing a reasoning for why TS tends to increase their prediction set sizes. 

- Challenging the common practice of calibrating DNNs before applying other post-processing algorithms like CP. The study suggests utilizing adaptive CP methods based on softmax values before temperature scaling.

In summary, the main contribution is an in-depth analysis, both empirically and theoretically, on the interplay between two popular techniques for uncertainty quantification in DNNs - temperature scaling calibration and conformal prediction.

The paper examines the interplay between temperature scaling (TS) calibration and conformal prediction (CP) techniques when applied to deep neural network classifiers. It studies the effect of TS, a popular calibration method, on CP algorithms like LAC, APS, and RAPS. Key findings include that TS tends to negatively impact the prediction set sizes of adaptive CP methods like APS and RAPS, especially for less accurate models. The paper also provides some theoretical analysis to reason about this effect. So the key focus is on the intersection of calibration, CP, coverage guarantees, and DNN classification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows empirically that temperature scaling (TS) has a detrimental effect on the prediction set sizes of adaptive conformal prediction methods like APS and RAPS. Can you further analyze the mathematical relationship between TS and the scoring functions used in APS/RAPS to better understand why this effect occurs?

2. You recommend applying adaptive CP methods on the softmax probabilities before temperature scaling. However, TS is commonly used to improve model calibration. How would you balance the trade-off between better calibration and smaller prediction set sizes? Is there an optimal point?

3. You theoretically analyze the effect of TS on the gap function $g(\bpi;T,L)$ for a simplified case. Can you extend the analysis to better approximate the actual distributions of hard vs. typical samples encountered during model deployment? 

4. Proposition 1 states that TS affects coverage only through misclassified samples. Does a similar theoretical result hold for the effect of TS on prediction set sizes? If not, why?

5. The empirical study is done on 5 image classification datasets and models. How would you expect the effect of TS on CP methods to change for other data types (e.g. text, time series data) and model architectures (e.g. transformers)?

6. You suggest applying adaptive CP on the original softmax probabilities in overconfident models. However, other calibration methods like vector scaling also reduce confidence. How would you expect those methods to interact with CP?

7. You motivate the need for both model calibration and theoretically-grounded uncertainty estimates like CP. For a given application, could you formalize the process of selecting an appropriate trade-off between the two objectives? 

8. The experiments held out random batches of 20% data for calibration and CP. How sensitive are the results to the size of the held-out sets? Would you expect different behavior with less data available?

9. The paper studies TS as an initial pre-processing step before CP. An alternative would be to adjust TS to directly optimize CP performance on a validation set. What are the pros and cons of each approach?

10. The analysis focuses only on classification problems. For other tasks like regression or segmentation, what modifications would be needed in the empirical analysis and theoretical results?
