# [Investigating a domain adaptation approach for integrating different   measurement instruments in a longitudinal clinical registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In longitudinal clinical registries, different measurement instruments are often used to assess individuals over time. For example, in a registry for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, different physiotherapeutic tests are used depending on factors like patient age and disease severity. 

- Integrating data from different instruments would provide more information on disease progression for statistical modeling. However, it is unclear if and how well different instruments can be aligned to a common scale, especially with small sample sizes.

Method: 
- The authors propose a domain adaptation approach to map different instruments to a joint latent representation using variational autoencoders (VAEs). Separate VAEs are trained for each instrument.

- To align representations, individual latent trajectories are modeled via ordinary differential equations (ODEs). An additional neural network infers patient-specific ODE parameters from baseline info.

- The VAEs and ODE model are jointly optimized. An adversarial penalty encourages indistinguishable latent representations across instruments based on ODE solution distances.

Evaluation:
- Various synthetic datasets are created by modifying real SMA data to introduce different types of systematic discrepancies between instruments.

- Reasonable alignment is achieved even when perfect mapping is impossible, e.g. when one instrument is only observed conditional on another's score.

- On real data with two SMA assessment tests, adding the adversarial penalty gives the closest alignment of latent representations.

Contributions:
- Proposes a VAE + ODE modeling approach tailored to integrate different clinical assessment instruments with few timepoints per patient. 

- Shows the potential of domain adaptation techniques for longitudinal registry data through evaluations on synthetic and real datasets. 

- Introduces an adversarial penalty method to improve alignment of representations from different instruments to latent trajectories.
