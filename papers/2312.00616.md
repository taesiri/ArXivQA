# [Investigating a domain adaptation approach for integrating different   measurement instruments in a longitudinal clinical registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00616)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the potential of using domain adaptation techniques from computer science to integrate different clinical measurement instruments in a longitudinal cohort setting with few time points per individual. The authors develop an approach tailored for this setting, using separate variational autoencoders to map items from each measurement instrument to a joint latent representation. To align the representations, they fit orthogonal differential equations to model individual trajectories in the latent space, with parameters inferred from baseline variables. They add penalty terms to the loss function to encourage alignment to the common trajectory. Using synthetic modifications of spinal muscular atrophy data, they systematically evaluate the effect of different types of discrepancies between instruments on the feasibility of alignment. Their results indicate that while perfect alignment may not always be possible, reasonable mapping can still be achieved even in complex scenarios like instruments used conditionally on patient states. Application to real data from two instruments in a rare disease registry further demonstrates potential for integrating information. Overall, the paper illustrates how techniques from domain adaptation and dynamic modeling can be effectively combined for longitudinal data with few time points.
