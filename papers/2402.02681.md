# [Equivariant Symmetry Breaking Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Equivariant neural networks (ENNs) are effective for learning from data with underlying symmetries. However, they cannot produce lower symmetry outputs from higher symmetry inputs due to their inherent constraints.
- Many physical systems exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking where lower symmetry stable states emerge from highly symmetric initial conditions.
- Existing approaches to enable symmetry breaking in ENNs have limitations in terms of equivariance, generalizability, and ability to sample all possible outputs.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce the concept of "symmetry breaking sets" (SBS) which are sets of parameters that can be sampled and provided as input to an ENN along with the data to allow breaking symmetry in an equivariant manner.
- Show that optimizing equivariant SBSs reduces to a well-studied group theory problem of finding complements of normal subgroups. Provide complete characterization for point groups.   
- For partial symmetry breaking, generalize the theory to "partial SBSs" and connections to finding complements in quotient groups.
- Demonstrate the approach on example tasks of deforming various geometric shapes and modeling phase transitions in materials.

Main Contributions:
- Novel symmetry breaking framework that retains equivariance and generalizability to any symmetry group.
- Reduces optimization of SBSs to known group theory problems with available solutions.  
- Enables sampling of all possible lower symmetry outputs in a data-efficient manner.
- Conceptually simple to implement on top of existing ENN architectures.
- Provides formal theoretical characterization as well as experimental validation on test cases.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical contributions in enabling equitable symmetry breaking in ENNs and demonstrates its usefulness on practical applications like modeling crystal phase transitions.
