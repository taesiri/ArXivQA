# [Equivariant Symmetry Breaking Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Equivariant neural networks (ENNs) are effective for learning from data with underlying symmetries. However, they cannot produce lower symmetry outputs from higher symmetry inputs due to their inherent constraints.
- Many physical systems exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking where lower symmetry stable states emerge from highly symmetric initial conditions.
- Existing approaches to enable symmetry breaking in ENNs have limitations in terms of equivariance, generalizability, and ability to sample all possible outputs.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce the concept of "symmetry breaking sets" (SBS) which are sets of parameters that can be sampled and provided as input to an ENN along with the data to allow breaking symmetry in an equivariant manner.
- Show that optimizing equivariant SBSs reduces to a well-studied group theory problem of finding complements of normal subgroups. Provide complete characterization for point groups.   
- For partial symmetry breaking, generalize the theory to "partial SBSs" and connections to finding complements in quotient groups.
- Demonstrate the approach on example tasks of deforming various geometric shapes and modeling phase transitions in materials.

Main Contributions:
- Novel symmetry breaking framework that retains equivariance and generalizability to any symmetry group.
- Reduces optimization of SBSs to known group theory problems with available solutions.  
- Enables sampling of all possible lower symmetry outputs in a data-efficient manner.
- Conceptually simple to implement on top of existing ENN architectures.
- Provides formal theoretical characterization as well as experimental validation on test cases.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical contributions in enabling equitable symmetry breaking in ENNs and demonstrates its usefulness on practical applications like modeling crystal phase transitions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for allowing equivariant neural networks to systematically break symmetry in their outputs relative to symmetrical inputs by designing additional "symmetry breaking sets" as extra network inputs based on the symmetry group structure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for allowing equivariant neural networks to systematically break symmetry in their outputs. Specifically, the authors introduce the concept of symmetry breaking sets (SBSs) which are additional inputs provided to the network that allow it to sample lower symmetry outputs. The key insight is that by imposing an equivariance constraint on these SBSs, the problem of minimizing their size maps to a well-studied group theory problem of finding complements of normal subgroups. The authors prove results characterizing when ideal or efficient SBSs exist and provide concrete examples of constructing them. Compared to prior work, this approach has the advantages of preserving equivariance, being simple to implement, and applying generally to any group symmetry. The experiments demonstrate how the framework enables symmetry breaking in practice across a variety of tasks. Overall, this paper provides an elegant group theoretic perspective on the problem of symmetry breaking in equivariant networks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Equivariant neural networks (ENNs): Neural networks that incorporate symmetries, allowing them to learn more easily on data with underlying symmetries.

- Symmetry breaking: The phenomenon where a system transitions from a highly symmetric state to a less symmetric one, which occurs in many physical systems. 

- Symmetry breaking sets (SBSs): Sets of parameters that can be fed into an ENN to allow it to break symmetry in its outputs.

- Equivariance: A property requiring that transforming the input in specified ways yields transformed outputs. ENNs leverage equivariance.

- Partial symmetry breaking: Breaking symmetry down to a subgroup rather than fully breaking all symmetry.

- Normalizer: A group theory concept related to finding subgroups whose orientation leaves a given subgroup unchanged. Key for defining equivariant SBSs.  

- Complements of normal subgroups: A group theory problem connected to finding ideal equivariant SBSs that break symmetry completely.

So in summary, the key themes are using symmetry breaking sets within equivariant neural networks to model symmetry breaking phenomena, with connections to concepts in group theory.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of an "equivariant symmetry breaking set" (SBS). Can you explain in more detail what defines an equivariant SBS and why is equivariance an important property for the SBS? 

2. The paper shows that constructing an optimal equivariant SBS is equivalent to finding complements of normal subgroups in group theory. Walk through the details of this proof and provide some intuition as to why this equivalence exists.

3. When an ideal equivariant SBS does not exist, the paper defines the "degeneracy" to characterize the efficiency of a non-ideal SBS. Explain what the degeneracy represents and how it is calculated. Provide an example calculation.

4. The paper claims that sometimes it is beneficial to break more symmetry than necessary when constructing a partial SBS. Provide an explanation and specific example of when and why this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs. 

5. The proofs relating equivariant SBSs to complements of normal subgroups rely heavily on concepts from group theory like normalizers and orbit-stabilizer theorems. Provide more intuition on how these group theory ideas connect to constructing efficient SBSs.

6. The experiments provide some simple examples demonstrating the framework, but how might this approach scale to more complex and realistic tasks like protein folding or molecular dynamics? What challenges do you foresee?

7. The paper assumes the symmetry of the inputs and desired outputs are known. Discuss whether and how this method could work if the symmetries need to be detected from the data itself.

8. How does the concept of an equivariant SBS compare to other techniques for symmetry breaking in ENNs like learning symmetry breaking order parameters or approximately equivariant models? What are the tradeoffs?

9. The method requires modifying existing ENN architectures by augmenting the input with the SBS. Could these ideas be incorporated more fundamentally into the design of ENN layers instead? Why or why not?

10. The paper focuses on breaking symmetries described by the point groups. How might the characterization of optimal SBSs change for other types of symmetry groups like space groups or general linear groups?
