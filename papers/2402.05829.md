# [Limitations of Agents Simulated by Predictive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates limitations that arise when trying to simulate capable, goal-directed agents simply by having a predictive model generate sequences of actions. Specifically, it identifies two failure modes:

1) Auto-suggestive delusions: When the training data comes from agents acting based on hidden/latent variables not available in the training data, the model will treat its own generated actions as evidence for those hidden variables. This causes the simulated agent to be incorrectly confident about the environment state. 

2) Predictor-policy incoherence: When the training data contains samples from an optimal policy mixed with more common suboptimal policies, the model's predictions reflect the average policy performance rather than what its own simulated optimal policy could achieve. So the simulated agent fails to choose the optimal actions that require consistency over multiple steps.

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that both failure modes arise due to the model's outputs becoming a confounding variable relative to the training distribution. The solution is to fine-tune the model by continuing to train it on additional data that comes from its own simulated agents interacting with the environment. This adds the necessary feedback loop to resolve the confounding.

Contributions:
- Identifies and provides examples of two structural limitations of agents derived from predictive models: auto-suggestive delusions and predictor-policy incoherence
- Gives formal definitions and analysis showing how additional self-supervised fine-tuning helps address these limitations
- Empirically demonstrates the presence of the two limitations in simple game environments, and shows improved performance from fine-tuning on model-generated data

The analysis offers a theoretical explanation for why techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback that involve further fine-tuning can yield much more capable goal-directed agents from predictive models. It also suggests fundamental constraints around the emergence of agency in systems based solely on passive prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces predictor-policy incoherence as a limitation for agents simulated by goal-conditioned generative models and shows that iteratively retraining the models on their own simulated trajectories alleviates both this and the previously studied issue of auto-suggestive delusions, resulting in agents that more optimally achieve goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces and formally defines the concept of "predictor-policy incoherence", which refers to the inability of agents simulated by predictive models to reason about their own policy being used in future situations beyond a short horizon. This is a novel concept introduced in this paper.

2) It proves formally that repeatedly re-training predictive models on their own simulated actions decreases predictor-policy incoherence and eliminates auto-suggestive delusions. This makes the resulting agents converge on optimal policies. 

3) It demonstrates empirically, through experiments on simple games using synthetic data and Decision Transformers, that goal-conditioned generative models can display both auto-suggestive delusions and predictor-policy incoherence. It also shows that re-training those models on their own outputs leads to models that simulate agents with fewer of those issues.

4) It provides a unified framework for understanding these two modes of failure in agents derived from predictive models, and shows how techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback that involve fine-tuning on the model's own outputs can address these limitations.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of predictor-policy incoherence, along with the empirical demonstration that fine-tuning on a model's own outputs can mitigate the issues of both predictor-policy incoherence and the related problem of auto-suggestive delusions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Auto-suggestive delusions - When a predictive model is used to simulate an agent, it incorrectly treats the actions it generates as evidence for nonexistent observations, leading to delusional inferences. 

- Predictor-policy incoherence - When a predictive model predicts actions based on what policy generated them in the training data, rather than predicting optimal actions for its own simulated policy. This leads to unnecessary conservatism. 

- Control as inference - The theory relating generative action models to policies, used as a framework to study the limitations. 

- Fine-tuning - Retraining the predictive model on data generated by its own simulated agents. This is shown formally and empirically to reduce both auto-suggestive delusions and predictor-policy incoherence.

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - An approach related to fine-tuning predictive models on their own outputs. The results give insight into why this works.

- Decision Transformers - A type of conditioned generative model used in the experiments to demonstrate the limitations and efficacy of fine-tuning.

So in summary, key terms cover the failures of simulated agents, the theory connecting them, and methods for overcoming the limitations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that there are two key structural reasons why agents simulated by predictive models can fail even if the models make optimal predictions. Can you elaborate on what is meant by "structural reasons" here and how that is different from other limitations?

2. When discussing auto-suggestive delusions, the paper states "the model will incorrectly use the actions it generated to infer the latent state". Can you walk through how this process happens step-by-step? 

3. How does the proposed formal definition of predictor-policy incoherence capture the intuition provided in the 3 cards game example? What are the key components it aims to quantify?

4. The paper claims re-training the model on its own outputs addresses both auto-suggestive delusions and predictor-policy incoherence. What is the conceptual reason or intuition why this helps in both cases?

5. In the formal treatment, how does the goal conditioning operator G work? Walk through the definitions and how applying G repeatedly converges to an optimal policy. 

6. What does the delusion measure aim to quantify and how was it implemented in the padlock experiment? Explain how it changes from pre-training to fine-tuning.

7. The tic-tac-toe experiment shows improved performance from fine-tuning, but the incoherence measure does not necessarily decrease. Why does theory predict convergence only in the limit? 

8. The paper argues these limitations exist even for optimal predictive models. What evidence supports that claim? How do the results generalize beyond the simple experimental setups?

9. The discussion relates the findings to contemporary techniques like RLHF and DPO. Can you expand on the proposed mechanisms by which those techniques could reduce these failures?

10. What are some ways the limitations described could be embraced for scalable oversight? How might we deliberately construct training data to simulate preferred policies?
