# [TARGET: Federated Class-Continual Learning via Exemplar-Free   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 From my reading, the key research focus of this paper is federated class-continual learning, which aims to enable continually learning new classes in a federated learning setting while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of old classes. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called TARGET (federatTed clAss-continual leaRninG via Exemplar-free disTillation) to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in federated class-continual learning scenarios. The central hypothesis is that leveraging global information from the federated learning process can help alleviate catastrophic forgetting without requiring storing additional datasets or previous task data.

To test this hypothesis, the paper first analyzes the impact of non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data on exacerbating catastrophic forgetting in federated learning. It then proposes the TARGET framework which utilizes knowledge distillation from the global model trained on previous tasks to transfer knowledge to the model for the current task, along with training a generator to produce synthetic data capturing the global data distribution. This allows leveraging global information to mitigate catastrophic forgetting without violating privacy by storing real data.

Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the paper demonstrates that TARGET outperforms existing federated class-continual learning methods by achieving higher average accuracy across tasks and lower forgetting of previous tasks. The results validate their hypothesis that using global information can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting in this setting.

In summary, the central research contribution is proposing and evaluating the TARGET framework to enable privacy-preserving federated class-continual learning by mitigating catastrophic forgetting through utilizing global model knowledge and synthesized global data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The authors propose a new method called TARGET (federatTed clAss-continual leaRninG via Exemplar-free disTillation) for alleviating catastrophic forgetting in the setting of Federated Class-Continual Learning (FCCL). 

2. They demonstrate that non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data exacerbates the catastrophic forgetting problem in FCCL.

3. Their proposed method leverages global information from the previously trained global model to transfer knowledge to the model being trained on the current task, without requiring storage of extra datasets or data from previous tasks. This makes it applicable to privacy-sensitive scenarios.

4. They introduce a generator that is trained to produce synthetic data simulating the global data distribution. This synthetic data is used along with the real data for local model updates.

5. Extensive experiments show that their method outperforms existing FCCL methods in terms of mitigating catastrophic forgetting, especially in cases of extreme non-IID data distributions.

In summary, the key novelty of this work seems to be the proposal of an exemplar-free knowledge distillation approach to alleviating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning settings, while preserving data privacy. The use of synthetic global data and transfer learning from previous global models are the main technical contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called TARGET for federated class-continual learning that mitigates catastrophic forgetting when learning a sequence of classification tasks with new classes by using knowledge distillation and synthesizing data to simulate the global data distribution, without requiring storage of previous task data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on federated class-continual learning relates to other research in the same field:

- It tackles the relatively new and underexplored problem of class-continual learning in the federated learning setting, where new classes are incrementally added over time. Most prior federated learning research assumes static classes.

- The paper demonstrates that non-IID data exacerbates catastrophic forgetting in the federated continual learning setting. This analysis of the relationship between data heterogeneity and forgetting provides new insights.

- The proposed TARGET method utilizes global model distillation and data generation techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting without needing to store exemplars or old task data, unlike other federated continual learning approaches. This makes it applicable to privacy-sensitive scenarios.

- By not relying on stored data, the work relates to recent exemplar-free continual learning methods like DeepDream and Always Be Dreaming. However, those methods were not designed for federated learning with non-IID data distributions.

- The paper introduces techniques like boundary-aware loss and batch normalization loss for improving the quality of generated pseudo-data for old tasks. This data generation strategy is tailored for federated continual learning.

- Extensive experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TARGET, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing federated continual learning baselines.

In summary, this paper advances federated continual learning research by tackling new challenges related to class-incremental learning, analyzing data heterogeneity issues, and proposing a novel data-free distillation approach suitable for non-IID federated settings. The data generation and model distillation techniques differentiate this work from prior art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated methods for generating high-quality synthetic data that better captures the complexity and diversity of the real training data. The authors note that their method of using synthetic data was not yet able to outperform approaches that store real exemplars. Improving the synthetic data generation is an important direction.

- Exploring ways to more efficiently select or generate synthetic data that provides greater knowledge transfer from previous tasks using less data. The authors found that simply increasing the amount of synthetic data does not necessarily lead to better performance. More research is needed on how to extract and transfer more valuable knowledge using limited synthetic data.

- Extending the approach to other domains beyond image classification, such as NLP tasks. The authors evaluated their method on image datasets, so applying and validating it on textual or other types of data is an important direction.

- Developing personalized versions of the approach that can account for heterogeneity in the data across clients. The authors assume the same global distribution is relevant to all clients, but adapting the synthetic data generation for each client could be beneficial.

- Theoretically analyzing the proposed method and providing performance guarantees or bounds. The paper empirically validated the approach, but formal analysis of its properties would be valuable.

- Comparing and combining the approach with other privacy-preserving federated learning methods, such as secure aggregation and differential privacy.

- Exploring online continual learning scenarios where tasks arrive in a fully sequential manner during training, rather than the batched setting used in the paper.

In summary, the key future directions are: improving synthetic data quality and efficiency, extending the approach to new domains and tasks, developing personalized and theoretical versions, and evaluating in online continual learning settings. Advances in these areas could help make the method more practical and deployable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on an under-explored yet important problem: Federated Class-Continual Learning (FCCL), where new classes are dynamically added in federated learning. Existing FCCL works suffer from various limitations, such as requiring additional datasets or storing the private data from previous tasks. In response, the authors first demonstrate that non-IID data exacerbates catastrophic forgetting issue in FL. Then they propose a novel method called TARGET (federat\textbf{T}ed cl\textbf{A}ss-continual lea\textbf{R}nin\textbf{G} via \textbf{E}xemplar-free dis\textbf{T}illation), which alleviates catastrophic forgetting in FCCL while preserving client data privacy. TARGET leverages the previously trained global model to transfer knowledge of old tasks to the current task at the model level. Moreover, a generator is trained to produce synthetic data to simulate the global distribution of data on each client at the data level. Compared to previous FCCL methods, TARGET does not require any additional datasets or storing real data from previous tasks, making it ideal for data-sensitive scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TARGET in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in FCCL.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Federated Class-Continual Learning (FCCL) to enable continual learning of new classes in a federated learning setting. FCCL allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model by adding new classes over time, without requiring the clients to share their private raw data. The key challenge addressed is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new classes leads to decreased performance on the previous classes. 

To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in FCCL, the authors propose a method called TARGET (federatTed clAss-continual leaRninG via Exemplar-free disTillation). TARGET leverages the global model trained on previous tasks to transfer knowledge to the model for the current task through distillation. It also trains a generator to produce synthetic data that simulates the global data distribution. This synthetic data is used alongside the real local data to train the local models through distillation from the global model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate TARGET's ability to effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting in FCCL without needing extra datasets or previous task data.

The paper proposes a novel approach called TARGET (federat\textbf{T}ed cl\textbf{A}ss-continual lea\textbf{R}nin\textbf{G} via \textbf{E}xemplar-free dis\textbf{T}illation) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Federated Class-Continual Learning (FCCL). The key idea is to leverage global information from the previously trained global model to transfer knowledge to the model being trained on the current task, without requiring storage of previous local private data from clients. Specifically, the server trains a generator model to synthesize pseudo-data with a global distribution by inverting the previous global model. This synthesized pseudo-data is then used together with the real local data to train the local model for the current task via knowledge distillation, matching the outputs of the local model to the previous global model on the synthesized data. This allows transferring knowledge from previous tasks to the current task at both the data level via the synthesized global pseudo-data, and the model level via distillation, without needing to store real previous local data. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TARGET in alleviating catastrophic forgetting in FCCL compared to baseline approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is trying to address is how to enable continual learning of new classes in a federated learning setting without catastrophic forgetting of previous classes or violating data privacy. 

Specifically, the paper focuses on the problem of Federated Class-Continual Learning (FCCL), where new classes are dynamically added over time in federated learning. The key challenge is how to learn new classes without forgetting previous classes, especially when clients are unable to store or access old data due to privacy concerns.

The main research question would be: How can we effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting in FCCL while preserving client data privacy?

The paper proposes a new method called TARGET that tackles this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Leveraging knowledge from the global model trained on previous tasks to transfer knowledge to the new task model through distillation, without needing old task data.

2) Training a generator to synthesize data with global distribution to augment the real data for the new task, to simulate training on global data.

Compared to prior FCCL methods, TARGET does not require storing any real data from previous tasks or using any external datasets. The method aims to address the limitations of existing approaches and enable effective continual learning in FCCL without compromising data privacy.

In summary, the key problem is mitigating catastrophic forgetting in the setting of federated class-continual learning, and the proposed solution in this paper is the TARGET framework that utilizes model distillation and data generation to transfer knowledge of previous tasks without violating data privacy.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper focuses on tackling the problem of catastrophic forgetting in Federated Class-Continual Learning (FCCL), where new classes are dynamically added over time in federated learning. The authors first demonstrate that non-IID data distribution exacerbates forgetting in FCCL. To mitigate this issue, they propose a novel method called TARGET that leverages global information from the centralized server to reduce forgetting without compromising client data privacy. Specifically, TARGET transfers knowledge at both the model and data levels - it distills knowledge from the global model of the previous task into the current task model, and also trains a generator to synthesize data that approximates the global data distribution for each client. This synthesized data is combined with real local data to train the local models. Compared to prior FCCL methods, TARGET does not require any extra datasets or storing real data from previous tasks, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive applications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets demonstrate that TARGET achieves substantially higher accuracy and lower forgetting than state-of-the-art baselines. The core innovation lies in the idea of utilizing global information via model distillation and data synthesis to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in a privacy-preserving manner tailored for FCCL.
