# [Reframe Anything: LLM Agent for Open World Video Reframing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06070)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Short-form video is becoming more prevalent with the rise of mobile devices and social media. This requires reframing videos to fit different aspect ratios of various platforms. 
- Manual video reframing is time-consuming, expensive, and requires professional expertise. Existing automated methods rely on specific training data so they lack generalizability.  
- Different viewers focus on different subjects of interest within the same video. An adaptive system is needed that can reframe videos based on user instructions to meet specific objectives.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RAVA, a large language model (LLM) based agent for open world video reframing. 
- RAVA has three main stages - perception, planning, and execution. 
- In perception, it interprets user instructions and video content using language learning and video understanding tools like scene detection, segmentation models, and CLIP.
- In planning, it determines aspect ratios, layouts, prioritizes objects, plans effects and creates an execution blueprint based on user preferences.
- In execution, it carries out the blueprint by invoking editing tools to produce the final reframed video.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of RAVA, an LLM agent adept at flexible video reframing based on human directives.
- A perception, planning and execution framework that allows RAVA to effectively leverage existing foundation models as per instructions.
- Validation of RAVA's capabilities through experiments on video salient object detection and real-world video reframing tasks.
- Demonstration of RAVA's promise in the realm of AI-powered video editing to enhance content for diverse platforms.

In summary, the paper presents an LLM agent called RAVA that can understand videos and user interests, strategically plan reframing, and automatically edit videos as per human instructions for personalized and adaptive video reshaping.
