# [Search Engines Post-ChatGPT: How Generative Artificial Intelligence   Could Make Search Less Reliable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11707)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper discusses the integration of generative AI (GenAI) into search engines and the associated challenges. As search engines like Google, Bing, and You.com incorporate capabilities like chatbots and text generation, there are rising concerns around the accuracy and reliability of search results.

The main problem highlighted is that GenAI models like large language models (LLMs) have an inherent tendency to "hallucinate" or fabricate information that may seem coherent but is factually incorrect. The authors provide examples of incorrect or biased information presented authoritatively in search results. The core issues discussed are:

- LLMs mix up contextual information and present facts out of context, obscuring the provenance of information
- LLMs exhibit reluctance to acknowledge uncertainty and will confidently "guess" incorrect answers 
- Lack of transparency around GenAI search compounds issues of bias and credibility
- Pursuit of efficiency with LLMs comes at a cost of reliability and depth/diversity of results

The authors argue these factors reduce the integrity and reliability of search engines. However, the confident presentation by LLMs encourages unwarranted trust in the results. 

The outlook discusses active research directions like techniques to detect and reduce hallucinations, improving model inclusiveness to mitigate bias, and understanding changes in user behavior and trust. But technical limitations persist, putting search users at risk until solutions mature. Maintaining vigilance around the deployment of underdeveloped GenAI systems into public search platforms is emphasized.

In summary, the paper highlights important challenges at the intersection of search and AI that impact the credibility and equity of access to reliable information. The authors advocate addressing these urgently as search evolves to rely more on generative models.
