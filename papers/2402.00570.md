# [CADICA: a new dataset for coronary artery disease detection by using   invasive coronary angiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death globally. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is the gold standard for evaluating CAD, but has limitations like high interobserver variability in visually assessing stenosis severity. 
- There is a lack of openly available, high-quality datasets of ICA images to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems to assist in angiographic assessment of CAD.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce CADICA, a new annotated dataset of 668 ICA videos from 42 patients, with associated metadata like patient demographics and comorbidities. 
- The videos are annotated by cardiologists, with bounding boxes delimiting regions of interest that indicate lesions categorized by degree of stenosis. 
- A selection of 382 high-quality videos suitable for CAD classification is provided.
- The authors implement several convolutional neural network models and evaluate performance for binary classification of "lesion" vs "non-lesion" images.

Main Contributions:
- CADICA provides a rigorous, open-access ICA dataset to develop systems to aid CAD assessment and for clinicians to practice stenosis evaluation.  
- Baseline classification methods demonstrate functionality of the dataset and reasonable performance, despite the variety of lesion severity levels included.
- The complexity of the dataset poses a worthwhile challenge to improve CAD detection in a real-world scenario with inter-patient variability.
- Analysis gives the research community a starting point to enhance ICA image classification.

In summary, the paper introduces the novel CADICA dataset to facilitate research on computer-aided diagnosis of CAD using ICA images, important given the limitations of visual assessment. Initial classification experiments validate the dataset's utility, while the complexity shows promise to drive further advances in this application area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces CADICA, a new annotated dataset of invasive coronary angiography images and associated metadata to aid research in computer-aided diagnosis of coronary artery disease, and provides baseline classification methods to validate its functionality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Providing the research community with a comprehensive and rigorous scientific coronary angiography dataset consisting of videos acquired from patients and metadata related to diseases associated with them. This can serve as a benchmark for clinicians to train their skills in assessing CAD severity and for computer scientists to create computer-aided diagnosis systems.

2) Providing a set of resources and utilities for testing algorithms, which will be regularly reviewed and expanded based on researchers' feedback.

3) Providing a study of the performance of known architectures using the dataset for the task of classifying angiography images as "lesion" or "non-lesion". This validates the functionality of the dataset and gives the research community a starting point to improve CAD detection.  

4) Helping the community identify other related challenges to drive future research.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a new annotated dataset of coronary angiography images and videos along with baseline methods, to enable further research on computer-aided diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
