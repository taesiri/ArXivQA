# [Towards a Framework for Evaluating Explanations in Automated Fact   Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20322)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing need for interpretability of complex neural NLP models. One approach is to provide natural language rationales to explain individual predictions. 
- However, there is a lack of formalization around concepts, properties and evaluation metrics for these rationale-based "explanations".

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a framework to conceptualize rationale-based explanations, categorizing them into three levels based on structure:
  1) Free-form explanations - sequences of propositions
  2) Deductive explanations - sequences of propositions + relations between them 
  3) Argumentative explanations - arguments (premises + claims) + relations of attack/support between arguments
- Formal definitions are provided for each explanation type. 
- The paper also proposes several desirable properties to evaluate the quality of explanations, including coherence, relevance, non-redundancy, acceptability etc.
- Concrete metrics are suggested to empirically measure some of these properties.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to formally define concepts and properties for evaluating rationale-based NLP explanations
- Identifies 3 categories of explanations based on structure 
- Provides formal definitions and properties tailored to each explanation type
- Suggests quantitative metrics to measure explanation quality based on proposed properties
- Overall, provides a paradigm to systematically evaluate explanations in neural NLP

The framework focuses on explanations for fact verification but can be extended to other NLP tasks. By outlining formal concepts, properties and evaluation metrics, this work facilitates improved transparency and accountability for NLP systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a formal framework for defining and evaluating different types of natural language explanations, specifically free-form, deductive, and argumentative explanations, for model predictions in natural language processing tasks such as automated fact verification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a formal framework for evaluating different types of natural language explanations for model predictions in NLP. Specifically, the paper:

1) Defines three classes of explanations with increasing structure: free-form, deductive, and argumentative explanations. 

2) Proposes desirable properties tailored to each explanation type, such as coherence, relevance, non-redundancy, acceptability etc.

3) Provides concrete quantitative metrics to measure how well explanations satisfy those properties, to enable systematic evaluation of explanation quality.  

4) Grounds the analysis in the automated fact verification task, but notes that the framework could generalize to evaluating explanations for NLP predictions more broadly.

In summary, the paper argues for and develops a structured methodology for assessing explanation quality across varied explanation types and structures in NLP. This aims to enable more rigorous evaluation of the faithfulness and usefulness of rationalizing explanations.

The paper presents a framework for evaluating different types of rationalizing explanations in natural language processing, specifically for the task of automated fact verification. It defines three main classes of explanations (free-form, deductive, argumentative) and proposes formal definitions, desirable properties, and quantitative evaluation metrics for assessing explanations of each type. The goal is to provide guidance on systematically evaluating the quality of explanations aimed at rationalizing model predictions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three different classes of explanations - free-form, deductive, and argumentative. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these three types of explanations? What are some examples to illustrate them?

2. The paper defines several properties for evaluating explanations, such as coherence, relevance, non-redundancy, dialectical non-circularity etc. Can you explain one or two of these properties in more detail? Why are they important for assessing explanation quality?  

3. The paper offers quantitative metrics for evaluating explanations based on some of the proposed properties. For example, the coherence metric for free-form explanations. Can you walk through how this metric would be calculated? What are its limitations?

4. Do you think the proposed properties and metrics capture all the necessary criteria for evaluating explanation quality? What other properties or metrics would you suggest? 

5. The framework is applied to the task of automated fact verification. Do you think it can generalize to other NLP tasks? What adaptations may be required?

6. The deductive explanations draw parallels with chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought generation techniques. Can you expand on these connections? Do you see any limitations?

7. The argumentative explanations employ concepts from abstract argumentation frameworks. Can you explain what an argumentation framework is? How is it used to model explanations?

8. The paper defines notions of attack and support between arguments. Do you think the definitions provided capture enough semantics of disagreement and corroboration? How else could they be modeled?  

9. The dialectical faithfulness property relates the confidence of predictions to the argumentative explanations. Can you walk through this definition? Do you think it appropriately captures the intended relationship?

10. The paper focuses on human-centered properties and explanations. Do you think the framework could be adapted for evaluating explanations optimized for machine consumption? What changes would you suggest?
