# [Learning and Autonomy for Extraterrestrial Terrain Sampling: An   Experience Report from OWLAT Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17405)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the deployment and evaluation of a deep learning-based adaptive scooping strategy, called CoDeGa, on the Ocean Worlds Lander Autonomy Testbed (OWLAT) at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. CoDeGa was originally developed and trained on a simple low-fidelity testbed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The goal is to assess its feasibility for extraterrestrial terrain sampling missions which require autonomy to maximize scientific return given constraints like short mission durations. To enable the model's use on OWLAT's hardware, the authors develop data preprocessing steps to handle real-world noise and limitations. Experiments on novel out-of-distribution terrains in OWLAT demonstrate CoDeGa's capability to rapidly adapt online from limited experience and make substantially more effective scooping decisions compared to non-adaptive baselines. The successful deployment validates the potential of learning-based autonomy in future missions and provides insights into challenges like motion planning. Overall, this work shows the promise of transferring learning-based systems from idealized training environments to realistic testbeds.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents experiences and results from deploying a deep meta-learning model trained on a low-fidelity testbed for maximizing terrain sample collection to a high-fidelity NASA testbed simulating an ocean world lander, demonstrating the model's ability to rapidly adapt online to unfamiliar environments and make effective autonomous decisions despite significant domain shifts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is threefold:

1) Assessing the feasibility of transferring the CoDeGa-trained adaptive scooping model across systems with similar sensor suites, end-effectors, and primitive actions. The model is trained on a low-fidelity UIUC testbed but deployed and tested on the high-fidelity OWLAT testbed.

2) Validating the model's adaptability in novel, realistic environments provided by the OWLAT testbed. The model encounters significant domain shifts compared to the training data, including different materials, terrain features, and perspectives. Still, it adapts effectively. 

3) Sharing lessons learned from designing and deploying learning-based autonomy algorithms in space exploration contexts. This includes data preprocessing, motion planning, evaluating performance, and integrating with robotic testbeds.

In summary, the main contribution is deploying and validating the adaptive scooping strategy powered by a CoDeGa-trained model on a high-fidelity space analog testbed despite considerable gaps from the training environment. This demonstrates the potential of using learning-based autonomy for extraterrestrial terrain sampling missions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Deep Gaussian Process model to capture the relationship between the observation-action pair (o,a) and the reward r. Can you expand more on why a Gaussian Process was chosen for this task rather than other regression models? What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

2. In the training procedure for CoDeGa, the training terrains are split into separate mean and kernel training sets. Can you explain the motivation behind this? How does this encourage the kernel to encounter residuals that are more representative of out-of-distribution tasks?

3. The candidate scooping actions are parameterized by x,y position, yaw angle Î¸, depth d and stiffness b. What was the rationale behind choosing this particular parameterization? Would adding additional parameters like scoop orientation help capture more variance in possible actions? 

4. The vision pipeline involves reprojecting the OWLAT point cloud to a top-down view to match the UIUC testbed perspective. What distortions or artifacts might this reprojection introduce? How might this impact the model's performance?

5. In generating candidate actions, a uniform grid is established within identified scoopable regions. How was the granularity of this grid determined? What tradeoffs exist between a finer vs coarser grid resolution?  

6. What motivated the choice of acquisition function used by the Bayesian optimization to select actions? How does taking uncertainty into account lead to more robust performance under varying conditions?

7. The paper mentions using an impedance controller to execute the scooping trajectory with two possible stiffness values. What factors determine the choice of stiffness and how does this impact overall performance?

8. What types of preprocessing were done on the UIUC training data? How might inconsistencies in preprocessing between training and deployment impact model performance?

9. Could simulation be used to generate additional synthetic training data? What domain randomization strategies could help improve sim-to-real transfer of the model?

10. The model seems to adapt well despite significant domain shifts between the UIUC and OWLAT testbeds. What factors may have contributed most to this positive result? How might performance degrade with even larger gaps?
