# [MetaDreamer: Efficient Text-to-3D Creation With Disentangling Geometry   and Texture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10123)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes MetaDreamer, a two-stage text-to-3D generation method that leverages both 2D and 3D priors in a disentangled manner to efficiently generate high-quality 3D models from text prompts.
