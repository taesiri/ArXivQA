# [If LLM Is the Wizard, Then Code Is the Wand: A Survey on How Code   Empowers Large Language Models to Serve as Intelligent Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on how code empowers large language models (LLMs) to serve as intelligent agents (IAs) for complex tasks. It explores three key ways that integrating code into LLM training enhances their capabilities:

1) Code boosts LLM performance in programming, reasoning, and capturing structured knowledge:

- Programming: Code pretraining strengthens LLMs' ability to generate high-quality code, evaluate code, and enables collaborative coding between multiple LLM agents to solve complex programming problems.

- Reasoning: Code's logical, step-by-step structure enhances LLMs' chain-of-thought prompting for decomposing tasks. Translating tasks into executable code (program-of-thought) further improves performance in mathematical and logical reasoning.  

- Structured Knowledge: Code's features like variable typing and inheritance aid LLMs in structural commonsense reasoning. Understanding markup code also evolves LLMs' ability for visually situated language understanding.

2) Code connects LLMs to diverse function ends: 

The code-centric paradigm, where LLMs generate code to invoke functions, provides a scalable way to integrate LLMs with external tools across modalities (text, vision, audio etc.) and physical environments (robots, vehicles). This expands the scope of tasks LLMs can perform.

3) Code situates LLMs in an executable environment for automated feedback:

The deterministic nature of code execution enables creating test suites, conducting static analysis and generating rich feedback to enhance LLMs through selection, prompting or fine-tuning.

Additionally, the paper analyzes how code-empowered LLMs facilitate more capable IAs by:
i) enhancing perception, planning for decision making 
ii) enabling seamless action grounding, modular memory organization for execution
iii) leveraging automated feedback from code execution for self-improvement.

Finally, open challenges around causally quantifying code's influence on reasoning, exploring complementary training modalities, applying code scalably, and optimally utilizing multi-step feedback are discussed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper surveys how integrating code into the training and application of large language models empowers them with enhanced programming, reasoning, and knowledge capabilities as well as situates them to serve as more capable intelligent agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey on how code empowers large language models (LLMs) to serve as intelligent agents. The key contributions are:

1) It reviews and categorizes literature on how code training boosts LLMs' performance in programming, reasoning, and capturing structured knowledge. 

2) It discusses how code provides a unified interface for LLMs to connect with other functional ends like digital tools or physical environments, enabling cross-modality and cross-domain applications.

3) It explains how code offers LLMs an executable environment to collect automated feedback for self-improvement.

4) It analyzes how code-empowered LLMs facilitate intelligent agents in decision-making, execution, and self-improvement. 

5) It identifies key challenges and promising future directions in this field, such as causality between code training and reasoning enhancement, acquisition of reasoning beyond code, applying the code-centric paradigm, and multi-turn interaction.

In summary, this paper offers a holistic view on the synergy between code and LLMs, especially for building intelligent agents, by reviewing relevant literature, analyzing model capabilities, and discussing open problems.
