# [Well-Connected Set and Its Application to Multi-Robot Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of finding the largest well-connected set (LWCS) in a graph and its applications in multi-robot path planning. A well-connected set (WCS) is defined as a set of vertices in a graph where there exists a path between any pair of vertices that does not pass through other vertices in the set. The LWCS problem aims to find the WCS with maximum cardinality in a given graph. Identifying an LWCS has applications in designing parking structures, warehouse layouts, and multi-robot coordination to avoid congestion and deadlocks.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first proves that finding an LWCS is NP-hard. 
- Two algorithms are then proposed - an optimal depth-first search algorithm that guarantees finding an LWCS, and a faster greedy algorithm that finds an approximate solution.  
- For multi-robot path planning, a method called UNPP is proposed that first computes an LWCS offline. The robots' starts and goals are then mapped to the LWCS vertices to create a well-formed problem instance that can be solved using prioritized planning while avoiding deadlocks.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the concept of well-connected sets and largest well-connected set (LWCS)
- Proves that finding an LWCS is NP-hard
- Develops both optimal and approximate algorithms for finding LWCS
- Demonstrates application of LWCS in multi-robot path planning to enable complete prioritized planning
- Evaluates performance of LWCS algorithms on grids and benchmarks
- Establishes linear relation between LWCS size and number of vertices in grid graphs

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive treatment of the LWCS problem, including complexity analysis, algorithm design, application in multi-robot coordination, and extensive experimentation. The concept of well-connected sets and the algorithms proposed facilitate efficient layout design and deadlock-free multi-robot planning.
