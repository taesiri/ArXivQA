# [Attribute Structuring Improves LLM-Based Evaluation of Clinical Text   Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01002)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents the prompts used to generate clinical discharge summaries, extract structured attributes from them, score similarity of attribute values, and score similarity of complete discharge summaries, as well as the interface shown to human annotators for scoring attribute similarity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, it seems this paper presents prompts used to:

1) Generate clinical discharge summaries
2) Structure and extract attributes from the summaries 
3) Score similarity of attribute values
4) Score overall similarity of discharge summaries without structuring

It also shows an example interface used for human annotation of attribute similarity.

The main contribution appears to be the development and evaluation of prompts to generate, structure, and assess clinical discharge summaries. The prompts aim to produce high quality summaries and enable similarity comparisons in an automated way.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper content, some key terms and concepts I would associate with this paper include:

- Clinical discharge summaries 
- Information extraction
- Structured output
- Prompts 
- Similarity scoring
- Attributes 
- Annotation interface
- Machine learning researchers

The paper discusses using prompts to generate clinical discharge summaries, extract structured information from them, score similarity between attributes, and presents sample prompts provided to human annotators along with a screenshot of the annotation interface. Key concepts revolve around clinical notes, information extraction, structuring, scoring, and human evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The structuring prompt provides a description for each attribute the model is expected to extract. How were these descriptions decided upon and validated to ensure they provide enough context for the model? 

2. The annotations were done by 3 machine learning researchers who were authors of the study. Could there be an inherent bias in their similarity judgments compared to clinical experts? How could this impact the evaluation?

3. The structured attribute scoring prompt asks the model to consider clinical relevance and context when judging similarity. How well can we expect language models today to understand clinical semantics and make clinically relevant distinctions?

4. What preprocessing was done on the clinical notes before feeding them into the models? Could factors like misspellings, abbreviations etc. impact the quality of summarization and extraction?

5. The generation prompt has 5 detailed steps for creating a discharge summary. Would a more open-ended prompt allow for more abstractive summarization instead of following a template? What are the tradeoffs?

6. How robust is the structuring approach to variations in phrasing of the same information across clinical notes? How could this impact consistency of extraction? 

7. Could there be discrepancies in the level of details extracted for different attributes? What metrics were used to evaluate the consistency of extraction quality across attributes?

8. How suitable is semantic textual similarity based evaluation for a specialized domain like clinical text processing? Should metrics better suited for this domain be explored?

9. The scoring is on a scale of 1-4 but the document scoring uses a scale of 1-10. What was the rationale behind using different scales?

10. What experimentation was done with different sized language models? How significant is model scale vs amount of domain-specific pretraining for this task?
