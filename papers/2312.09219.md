# [NestE: Modeling Nested Relational Structures for Knowledge Graph   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09219)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces NestE, a novel approach for knowledge graph embedding that captures both atomic facts (triples) as well as nested facts about relationships between facts. Nested facts are represented as "quoted triples," where the subject or object is itself a triple, enabling the expression of complex semantics like situations over time and logical patterns beyond standard first-order logic rules. NestE represents atomic facts as 1x3 matrices and nested relations as 3x3 matrices that rotate the 1x3 matrices via a matrix-multiplicative Hamilton product in a 4D hypercomplex space. This provides flexibility to model diverse logical patterns over facts. NestE unifies previous quaternion, hyperbolic quaternion, and split quaternion embeddings into a single framework with distinct geometric spaces to represent different types of relations. Experiments on standard benchmarks for triple prediction and conditional link prediction demonstrate that NestE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by effectively modeling logical patterns and leveraging the strengths of different hypercomplex embeddings. The key novelty is the matrix-based modeling of nested facts using transformations in hypercomplex spaces to capture rich relational semantics and patterns.
