# [Conflict Transformation and Management. From Cognitive Maps to Value   Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07838)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for integrating two problem structuring methods - cognitive mapping and value trees - to support conflict transformation and management. It introduces a formal procedure to transform a cognitive map, which provides a descriptive understanding of a conflict according to different stakeholders, into a value tree, which reveals underlying values and enables the exploration of new solution alternatives. Through a step-by-step algorithm, a value cognitive map and ends-means map are constructed as intermediate steps that bridge the gap between problem description and solution design. A case study on the complex Kurdish-Turkish conflict demonstrates how this method can identify shared values and common ground, as well as generate previously unknown alternatives that balance the concerns of conflicting parties. By leveraging the strengths of both cognitive mapping and value trees, this integrated approach enhances problem structuring capabilities and promotes innovative, collaborative solutions, advancing conflict management research and practice. Its effectiveness across diverse decision contexts also underscores its broader potential in problem-solving and policy design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a formal method to transform cognitive maps into value trees in order to combine the strengths of both problem structuring methods and enable using them as design-oriented decision support tools for conflict resolution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a formal method to transform cognitive maps into value trees in order to move from a descriptive representation of a problem situation to a more prescriptive one that can aid in constructive conflict resolution and policy design. Specifically, the paper:

1) Proposes an approach to integrate the strengths of cognitive mapping (subjective understanding of problems) and value trees (formalized value-oriented thinking) into a more comprehensive problem structuring method. 

2) Introduces a step-by-step algorithm to systematically extract a value tree from a cognitive map by first transforming it into a "value cognitive map" and then an "ends-means map" before arriving at the value tree.

3) Demonstrates this transformation process on the real-world case study of the Kurdish-Turkish conflict, using separate cognitive maps and value trees for both perspectives. The value trees helped identify common ground and explore creative alternatives.

4) Highlights how this integration of descriptive and prescriptive methods enhances conflict analysis and resolution by providing both a nuanced understanding of different viewpoints as well as a structured framework to generate innovative solutions.

In summary, the key contribution is a formal procedure to convert subjective cognitive maps into more objective value trees to enable constructive policy design and decision support for conflict management. The paper shows the wider applicability of this approach beyond just conflict contexts.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of a "value cognitive map" as an intermediate representation between a regular cognitive map and a value tree. What is the purpose of having this intermediate representation and what extra information does it provide compared to a regular cognitive map?

2. When transforming a cognitive map to a value cognitive map, the paper suggests adding the prefix "valuing" to concept nodes to indicate their subjective value-laden nature. What is the rationale behind this and how does it aid in the analysis? 

3. The algorithm for transforming a value cognitive map to an ends-means map involves several steps of changing arrow directions and sign transformations. Explain the intuition behind always prioritizing the preservation of ends over means in this algorithm.

4. In the algorithm, when there are cycles present in the value cognitive map, the authors propose eliminating arcs to break the cycles. What considerations should be kept in mind while deciding which arc to eliminate? Is there potential for information loss?

5. The paper handles the issue of multiple predecessors to a node in the ends-means map by either splitting or merging nodes. Provide examples of when you would choose to split vs merge nodes and explain the decision rationale.  

6. While constructing a value tree from an ends-means map, the shortest path rule is used to order predecessors of a node. Why is the shortest path rule chosen and what are its limitations?

7. For the case study, if access was available to more Kurdish and Turkish stakeholders, how could the analysis be enriched by capturing multiple perspectives in the cognitive maps?

8. The authors claim combining cognitive maps and value trees leads to more innovative alternatives for conflict resolution. Explain if and how this occurred in the Kurdish-Turkish conflict case study.

9. The paper focuses solely on conflicts between two opposing stakeholders. How could the proposed method be extended for multi-stakeholder conflicts with more complex dynamics? 

10. What are some real-world challenges or limitations that could arise in applying the proposed transformation process from cognitive maps to value trees for an actual high-stakes conflict scenario?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Cognitive mapping is primarily descriptive and does not provide innovative solutions or strategies for conflict resolution. It focuses on the problem owner's perspective but lacks design-oriented methods.
- Value trees can be innovative but lack a formal structure for construction and can result in information loss or asymmetry. They do not fully capture problem complexity.
- There is a gap between descriptive problem structuring methods like cognitive mapping and more design-oriented methods like value trees. 

Proposed Solution:
- Integrate cognitive mapping and value trees to leverage the strengths of both approaches. 
- Formally transform a cognitive map into a value tree through intermediate steps:
   1. Convert concepts in cognitive map to values → value cognitive map
   2. Transform value cognitive map into an ends-means map by establishing ends-means relationships
   3. Resolve issues of multiple predecessors in ends-means map to construct a value tree
- Newly proposed "value cognitive map" retains structure of original cognitive map with insights from value-focused thinking

Main Contributions:
- Fills gap between descriptive and design-oriented problem structuring methods
- Enables construction of value tree from cognitive map through formal transformation process 
- Combines strengths of both methods for more comprehensive analysis of problem space
- Retains problem owner's perspective while enabling value-focused thinking 
- Facilitates exploration of new, previously unknown alternatives
- Demonstrated effectiveness through case study on Kurdish-Turkish conflict
- Relevant not just for conflict resolution but also decision-aiding and policy design

In summary, the paper formally integrates two complementary problem structuring methods to provide decision makers a comprehensive tool for analyzing complex conflicts and designing innovative solutions, with wide applicability.
