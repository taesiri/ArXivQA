# [Conflict Transformation and Management. From Cognitive Maps to Value   Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07838)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for integrating two problem structuring methods - cognitive mapping and value trees - to support conflict transformation and management. It introduces a formal procedure to transform a cognitive map, which provides a descriptive understanding of a conflict according to different stakeholders, into a value tree, which reveals underlying values and enables the exploration of new solution alternatives. Through a step-by-step algorithm, a value cognitive map and ends-means map are constructed as intermediate steps that bridge the gap between problem description and solution design. A case study on the complex Kurdish-Turkish conflict demonstrates how this method can identify shared values and common ground, as well as generate previously unknown alternatives that balance the concerns of conflicting parties. By leveraging the strengths of both cognitive mapping and value trees, this integrated approach enhances problem structuring capabilities and promotes innovative, collaborative solutions, advancing conflict management research and practice. Its effectiveness across diverse decision contexts also underscores its broader potential in problem-solving and policy design.
