## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NoiseCLR: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Unsupervised Discovery of Interpretable Directions in Diffusion Models":

Problem:
- Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can generate high-quality images but their latent space is not well understood or disentangled. This makes precise control over image generation difficult.
- Existing methods rely on text prompts to explore the latent space. This can be limiting, especially for domains like art where appropriate prompts are not easy to construct. 
- Unsupervised discovery of directions in the latent space is challenging, especially for large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes NoiseCLR, an unsupervised contrastive learning framework to discover interpretable directions in the latent space of diffusion models. 
- The key idea is that edits by the same direction should attract each other while edits by different directions should repel each other.
- NoiseCLR works by adding small perturbations to the noise predictions from the diffusion model during sampling. It trains directions to maximize similarity of edits by the same direction while minimizing similarity of edits by different directions.
- It does not need any labeled data, text prompts or fine-tuning. It only requires a small set of unlabeled images from the domain of interest.

Main Contributions:
- First unsupervised method to successfully discover diverse and disentangled directions in the latent space of large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.
- Can find directions across various domains like faces, cats, cars, art using a single Stable Diffusion model.
- Directions are highly disentangled - multiple directions can be combined within or across domains.
- Achieves strong performance on semantic edits, competitive with state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion based image editing techniques.
- Enhances control, transparency and reliability of large diffusion models. Can help identify potential biases.

In summary, NoiseCLR pioneers unsupervised discovery of fine-grained and disentangled directions in the latent space of diffusion models. It opens up new capabilities for controlled image editing and generation using these models.
