# [DAGnosis: Localized Identification of Data Inconsistencies using   Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Identification and appropriate handling of inconsistencies in data at deployment time is crucial for reliable use of machine learning models. Recent data-centric methods can identify inconsistencies with respect to the training set, but have two key limitations:

1) They use compressive representations (e.g. PCA, autoencoders) which are suboptimal when features exhibit statistical independencies, as is common in tabular data where features interactions are often sparse.

2) They lack localization - the ability to pinpoint why a sample is flagged as inconsistent. This is important to guide future data collection or suggest new measurements to correct test samples with noise.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes DAGnosis, a data-centric evaluation method that leverages directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures to encode the training set's feature distribution and independencies. Key aspects:

- Learns a DAG describing relationships between features 
- Trains feature-wise conformal predictors, conditioned on relevant variables determined by the DAG (not full representation)
- Provides feature-wise conclusions to flag if a test sample is inconsistent
- Crucially, DAG structure enables localizing causes of inconsistencies on the graph

Main Contributions:

1) Conceptually, first method to leverage structures for data-centric insights and consistency evaluation

2) Unlocks ability to localize reasons why a sample is inconsistent, which was not possible before 

3) Empirically demonstrates superior accuracy in detecting inconsistencies, and improved downstream performance when deferring predictions on inconsistent samples

4) Provides case study on real dataset showing how DAGnosis helps gain understanding of inconsistencies to guide data collection

By leveraging structures and conditional independence in data, DAGnosis brings more accurate and insightful data-centric conclusions compared to prior arts. Localization capability is a key benefit for auditing and debugging inconsistencies.
