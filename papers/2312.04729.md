# [The Internet of Responsibilities-Connecting Human Responsibilities using   Big Data and Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accountability in the workplace regarding safety management remains a challenging issue. Although some patents have been filed related to responsibility management, a complete responsibility assignment management system is still lacking. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a big data driven accountability management model called the "Internet of Responsibilities (IoR)" to improve safety and quality control in enterprises and institutions. 

- The IoR model has four layers:
    1) Perception layer: Collects responsibility data from hazardous locations
    2) Internet layer: Uploads data to the internet
    3) Data layer: Manages and analyzes responsibility data using directed acyclic graphs and blockchain
    4) Application layer: Monitors events, sends alerts and manages responsibilities

- The model defines responsibility modules and hierarchies within an organization. It automatically evaluates responsibilities using completion and execution scores. 

- Blockchain technology seals responsibility data for accountability. The model summarizes risk levels across units for oversight.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel concept of an Internet of Responsibilities (IoR) driven by big data and blockchain for accountability management
- Develops a comprehensive four layer IoR model architecture and details the key enabling technologies 
- Provides practical deployment results in industry showing increased responsibility scores and safety awareness
- Offers governments and regulators better real-time visualization and monitoring capabilities over accountability

In summary, the paper puts forth an Internet of Responsibilities system to address challenges in responsibility and safety management in enterprises. The proposed big data and blockchain based solution shows promising real-world improvement in accountability.
