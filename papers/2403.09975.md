# [Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09975)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Understanding human actions from skeletal movement is important for human-robot interaction and assistive robots. However, annotating large activity sequence datasets precisely is time-consuming, resulting in noisy labels.  
- Label noise negatively impacts model training and recognition quality. Addressing label noise for skeleton-based action recognition has been overlooked so far.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new framework, NoiseEraSAR, to augment skeleton-based action recognition methods to handle label noise. It integrates global sample selection, co-teaching and a Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts (CM-MOE) strategy.

- NoiseEraSAR has two main phases - pretraining and fine-tuning. It extracts joint, bone and motion modalities from each sample. For each modality, two models are trained simultaneously using co-teaching to select clean samples. 

- A global sample selector then chooses clean labeled samples from the three modalities which are combined for the CM-MOE system. This fuses the models from different modalities using a spatiotemporal graph gate network to dynamically adjust modality weights.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark for skeleton-based human action recognition under noisy labels by implementing label denoising methods from other domains.

- A new NoiseEraSAR method combining sample selection and multi-modality fusion to address label noise for skeleton-based recognition.

- Comprehensive experiments showing NoiseEraSAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods under different noise levels. It sets new standards achieving 74.9% and 79.5% accuracy on NTU-60 with 80% noise.

In summary, the paper tackles the new problem of label noise in skeleton-based action recognition. It proposes NoiseEraSAR which shows superior performance across noise levels by effectively selecting clean samples and fusing complementary multi-modal skeletal information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called NoiseEraSAR that combines cross-training, global sample selection, and cross-modal mixture-of-experts to address the problem of label noise in skeleton-based human action recognition, outperforming prior methods on a benchmark based on the NTU-60 dataset with simulated label noise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It opens up the area of skeleton-based human action recognition under noisy label scenarios. The paper constructs a new benchmark by implementing well-established label denoising methods from other domains into skeleton-based action recognition pipelines. 

2. It proposes a new method called NoiseEraSAR for addressing label noise in skeleton-based human action recognition. NoiseEraSAR combines co-teaching for multi-modal streams, global sample selection, and a Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts (CM-MoE) technique.

3. Experiments show that NoiseEraSAR achieves promising results on the NTU-60 dataset under different label noise ratios and evaluations, significantly outperforming prior methods. This demonstrates its effectiveness in training robust skeleton-based human action recognition models when dealing with low-quality labels.

4. The paper helps enable more robust skeleton-based human action recognition to serve robot-based human daily life assistance. It contributes towards addressing the important real-world challenge of label noise in this area.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating NoiseEraSAR, a new method tailored to handle label noise for the important task of skeleton-based human action recognition.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts (CM-MoE) framework. Can you explain in detail how this framework works and how it helps mitigate the impact of noisy labels? 

2. The global sample selector constructs a clean dataset by taking the union of samples selected from the joint, bone, and motion modalities. Why is it beneficial to use this selection criteria instead of selecting from a single modality?

3. The paper uses a co-teaching approach during cross-training. How does the small-loss co-teaching strategy help prevent the models from overfitting to noisy labels?

4. The gate network in CM-MoE dynamically adjusts the weights of the outputs from the different models across modalities. How is this gate network designed? What is the intuition behind using a spatio-temporal graph structure?  

5. The paper introduces symmetric label noise during training. What strategies could be used to deal with more realistic asymmetric label noise?  

6. How does the performance of the proposed method vary across different levels of label noise (20%, 40%, 50%, 80%)? What insights do the results provide about the method's noise robustness?

7. Could active or semi-supervised learning strategies be integrated into the method to further improve performance under noisy labels? If so, how?

8. The CM-MoE framework combines models trained on different input modalities (joint, bone, motion). What benefits does multi-modal learning provide in this context?

9. How does the performance of NoiseEraSAR compare when using different backbone models for skeleton-based action recognition? Does it demonstrate cross-backbone generalizability?  

10. The paper compares NoiseEraSAR with SOP and NPC methods. What are the key differences in methodology that contribute to the superior performance of NoiseEraSAR?
