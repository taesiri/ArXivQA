# [PatchFusion: An End-to-End Tile-Based Framework for High-Resolution   Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing depth estimation models struggle with high-resolution images due to limited input resolution constraints. While methods like guided super-resolution and implicit functions have attempted to address this, they have limitations in propagating errors or losing high-frequency details. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes PatchFusion, a novel end-to-end tile-based framework for high-resolution monocular metric depth estimation. The key ideas are:

(1) Coarse-to-fine estimation: Global coarse prediction provides scale consistency while local fine predictions give details.  

(2) Guided Fusion Network: A lightweight U-Net fuses coarse and fine depth maps using guidance from coarse and fine model features.

(3) Global-to-Local (G2L) Module: Retains global context in coarse features to provide scale awareness to fusion network.

(4) Consistency-Aware Training and Inference: Enforces consistency of overlapping patches in training and aggregates predictions using running average during inference.

Main Contributions:

(1) First end-to-end tile-based method for metric depth requiring no patch selection or post-processing.

(2) Novel guided fusion network with G2L module to incorporate global context awareness. 

(3) Consistency-aware training and inference strategy to enforce and aggregate seamless patch predictions.

(4) Improves performance over SOTA on UnrealStereo4K and MVS-Synth datasets by 17.3% and 29.4% in RMSE respectively. Good generalization to real datasets.

In summary, PatchFusion pushes state-of-the-art in high-resolution depth estimation through a guided tile-based framework with consistency awareness that can be trained end-to-end.
