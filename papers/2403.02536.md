# [Forecasting SEP Events During Solar Cycles 23 and 24 Using Interpretable   Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the important problem of predicting Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. SEP events pose radiation hazards to aviation, spacecraft, and astronauts and can severely impact space missions. Therefore, accurately forecasting SEP events is critical for space weather monitoring and space exploration. However, consistently predicting SEP events has remained an elusive challenge. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using machine learning (ML) models trained on a newly combined dataset of solar active region parameters called SHARP-SMARP, covering two full solar cycles (23 and 24). This expanded dataset is expected to improve SEP prediction compared to prior works that utilized single-cycle data. Specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression models are trained on SHARP-SMARP parameters like unsigned magnetic flux, magnetic field gradient, and angular distance of active regions from Earth to predict whether solar flares will produce SEPs.

Key Contributions:
- Combines SHARP and SMARP datasets of solar active region parameters, offering continuous coverage over two solar cycles 
- Matches 154 SEP events to solar flares using NOAA/SWPC catalogs, labeling flares as SEP-producing (positive) or not (negative)
- Trains SVM and regression ML models on 6 SHARP-SMARP predictors to classify flares and forecast SEPs
- Achieves maximum accuracy of 0.70 using logistic regression in an experimental balanced setting  
- Shows modest accuracy increase over single-cycle data, but overall accuracy for imbalanced operational setting remains near random chance levels
- Verifies unsigned magnetic flux, magnetic field gradient near polarity inversion lines, and angular distance as useful predictors of SEPs
- Concludes dimensional limitations of current data hinders reliable SEP prediction, motivating more sophisticated methodology

In summary, the paper demonstrates ML-based SEP prediction using multi-cycle solar active region data, confirming usefulness of certain parameters, but ultimately highlights need for more complex models and data to enhance forecast capability suitable for operational use.
