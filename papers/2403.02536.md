# [Forecasting SEP Events During Solar Cycles 23 and 24 Using Interpretable   Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the important problem of predicting Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. SEP events pose radiation hazards to aviation, spacecraft, and astronauts and can severely impact space missions. Therefore, accurately forecasting SEP events is critical for space weather monitoring and space exploration. However, consistently predicting SEP events has remained an elusive challenge. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using machine learning (ML) models trained on a newly combined dataset of solar active region parameters called SHARP-SMARP, covering two full solar cycles (23 and 24). This expanded dataset is expected to improve SEP prediction compared to prior works that utilized single-cycle data. Specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression models are trained on SHARP-SMARP parameters like unsigned magnetic flux, magnetic field gradient, and angular distance of active regions from Earth to predict whether solar flares will produce SEPs.

Key Contributions:
- Combines SHARP and SMARP datasets of solar active region parameters, offering continuous coverage over two solar cycles 
- Matches 154 SEP events to solar flares using NOAA/SWPC catalogs, labeling flares as SEP-producing (positive) or not (negative)
- Trains SVM and regression ML models on 6 SHARP-SMARP predictors to classify flares and forecast SEPs
- Achieves maximum accuracy of 0.70 using logistic regression in an experimental balanced setting  
- Shows modest accuracy increase over single-cycle data, but overall accuracy for imbalanced operational setting remains near random chance levels
- Verifies unsigned magnetic flux, magnetic field gradient near polarity inversion lines, and angular distance as useful predictors of SEPs
- Concludes dimensional limitations of current data hinders reliable SEP prediction, motivating more sophisticated methodology

In summary, the paper demonstrates ML-based SEP prediction using multi-cycle solar active region data, confirming usefulness of certain parameters, but ultimately highlights need for more complex models and data to enhance forecast capability suitable for operational use.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper utilizes a merged dataset of solar active region parameters spanning two solar cycles to train machine learning models for predicting solar energetic particle (SEP) events, achieving modest gains in accuracy compared to previous works but underscoring the need for more sophisticated methodologies to reliably forecast these hazardous space weather events.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper utilizes a new dataset that combines the Space Weather MDI Active Region Patches (SMARP) and Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) parameters covering Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The key contributions are:

1) The paper trains machine learning models on this merged SMARP-SHARP dataset to predict whether a solar flare will produce a Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) event. A variety of models are tested, including Support Vector Machines and regression models.

2) The results indicate that even with the increased data spanning two solar cycles, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 ± 0.1. This is comparable to but does not exceed previous benchmark results in the literature that used less data. 

3) In an operational setting that retains the imbalanced classes, there is a slight increase (+0.04 ± 0.05) in accuracy for a 14-hour SEP event forecast compared to previous studies. This shows the SMARP-SHARP data contributes positively but lacks reliability for confident forecasting.

4) The paper analyzes the relevance of different SMARP-SHARP parameters to SEP prediction. It verifies that total unsigned magnetic flux, distance to the magnetic footpoint, and unsigned flux near polarity inversion lines are useful predictors.

In summary, the key contribution is utilizing the merged SMARP-SHARP dataset to train ML models for SEP prediction across two solar cycles. While prediction accuracy is comparable to previous works, operational reliability needs improvement by incorporating more sophisticated methodologies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The authors claim that using two solar cycles of data compared to just one solar cycle improves the accuracy of SEP event prediction by 0.04. However, the standard deviation is 0.05, so this improvement seems marginal. How could the authors further improve the accuracy of prediction using multi-cycle data?

2. The authors use both regression models and SVM models for prediction. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two types of models? Why did the authors choose to evaluate both instead of just one?

3. The choice of predictors used seems very important in determining prediction accuracy. The authors evaluated different combinations of predictors. What guidelines or criteria did they use to select these combinations? Could a more systematic approach for predictor selection lead to better accuracy?  

4. Data cleaning by removing non-SEP producing flares in SEP-producing active regions improved accuracy. However, in an operational setting, we may not know beforehand which regions will produce SEPs. How can this data cleaning step be adapted for real-time operational forecasting?

5. The angular distance between active regions and earth's magnetic footpoint is used as a predictor. The authors assume the footpoint is fixed at (0, 45) degrees. How reasonable is this assumption and could a dynamic footpoint model improve prediction?

6. The study shows only a modest gain in accuracy despite using 2x more data. Is there a theoretical limit to prediction accuracy with these magnetic field parameters? Would incorporation of other geophysical data help break this limit?  

7. Hyperparameter tuning and model selection methods are not discussed in detail. Could more systematic hyperparameter optimization lead to noticeable accuracy gains for this problem?

8. Were different kernel choices and parameters evaluated for the SVM models? Was any effort made to optimize the kernels and parameters?

9. The threshold for determining positive vs negative SEP event prediction has a big impact on performance metrics. How can the optimal threshold be determined for operational forecasting?

10. The final accuracy is still quite far from being operationally useful. What changes would need to be made to the models or data for the accuracy to reach more usable levels?
