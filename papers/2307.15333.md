# [Dynamic PlenOctree for Adaptive Sampling Refinement in Explicit NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15333)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we optimize the explicit neural radiance field (NeRF) representation to be more memory efficient while maintaining or improving rendering quality?In particular, the paper focuses on improving the PlenOctree (POT) representation by making it dynamic and adaptive. The key limitations identified with POT are:1) Its fixed octree structure limits adaptability to varying scene complexity during training. The initial sample distribution may not provide sufficient sampling in complex regions or lead to oversampling in simple regions.2) Storing the learnt features requires large model sizes and memory costs. To address these issues, the paper proposes DynamicOctree (DOT) which introduces hierarchical feature fusion to progressively prune less informative regions and selectively sample promising areas based on training signals. This allows adaptive adjustment of the octree division to better fit the signal complexity. The pruning and sampling operations enable rapid learning by aggregating features across the octree hierarchy.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a dynamic, adaptive octree can optimize the sample distribution and reduce memory costs compared to a fixed octree like POT, while maintaining or improving rendering quality. The experiments aim to validate whether DOT can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a dynamic octree framework called DOT to improve the sample distribution adaptiveness and parameter efficiency of explicit neural radiance fields like PlenOctree. Specifically, this paper points out that the fixed octree structure in PlenOctree is suboptimal as the scene complexity and optimal sampling distribution change during training. To address this, DOT introduces hierarchical feature fusion based on pruning and sampling operations to progressively refine the octree structure guided by training signals from the rendering process. Instead of heuristically dropping voxels during pruning, DOT aggregates features across the octree hierarchy to retain globally consistent representations. The sampling operation propagates features to child nodes to increase sampling in complex regions. Overall, DOT allows the octree structure to be dynamically calibrated to better fit the evolving signal complexity.Experiments show DOT can significantly reduce the parameter size of PlenOctree by over 55% while improving rendering quality and speed. The ability to compactly represent scenes and adaptively refine sampling demonstrates the benefits of a dynamic octree over a fixed structure for explicit neural radiance fields.In summary, the core contribution is proposing the DOT framework to enable adaptive octree refinement, achieving more efficient and higher quality explicit scene representations compared to prior arts like PlenOctree. The hierarchical feature fusion approach is critical for aggregating globally consistent features during this adaptive process.
