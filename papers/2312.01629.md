# [CLAMP: Contrastive LAnguage Model Prompt-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01629)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) excel at generative visual tasks like image captioning, but underperform on image classification tasks. For example, state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs achieve less than 10% top-1 accuracy on the Stanford Cars dataset, compared to over 80% for models like CLIP. 

- The authors hypothesize that the generative training objectives used for multimodal LLMs do not enable effective discrimination needed for classification tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose CLAMP (Contrastive Language Model Prompt-tuning), which adapts LLMs for classification by lightly fine-tuning them using a contrastive image-text matching loss, similar to CLIP.

- CLAMP uses output attention pooling and learnable "read-only" prompts to help the LLM produce useful representations for discrimination. It also uses LoRA to make light weight updates to the LLM parameters.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates that current multimodal LLMs fail at image classification, achieving 34% average accuracy over 24 datasets compared to 47% for CLAMP.

- Shows that contrastive fine-tuning of LLMs can enable strong image classification abilities, outperforming from-scratch training in domains under-represented in the pre-training data.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results among methods using general pre-trained LLMs, while retaining most of the model's generative capabilities.

- Provides analysis showing CLAMP's benefits come from the language model's prior when target data coverage in pre-training is low.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective approach to adapt large language models for image classification while retaining their generative strengths, outperforming prior multimodal LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes adapting large language models for zero-shot image classification by lightly fine-tuning them with a contrastive image-text loss, achieving strong performance while retaining generative capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Showing that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (LLMs) like LLaVA and MiniGPT perform poorly on zero-shot image classification, underperforming models like CLIP by over 10%.

2) Proposing a method called CLAMP (Contrastive LAnguage Model Prompt-tuning) to adapt LLMs for better image classification by using a contrastive loss to align the LLM text representations with image features, along with light finetuning techniques like attention pooling, read-only prompts, and LoRA.

3) Demonstrating that the proposed CLAMP method achieves much better image classification accuracy than generative mLLMs, slightly outperforming a contrastively trained text encoder baseline, while also retaining the generative capabilities of the LLM.

4) Analyzing the benefits of LLM pre-training for low-coverage datasets not well-represented in the visual pre-training data, where CLAMP outperforms baselines by up to 13%.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an effective way to adapt LLMs for discriminative visual tasks like image classification while preserving their strengths as generative models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper explores adapting large pretrained language models that have shown impressive capabilities in generative language tasks to also effectively perform image classification.

- Multimodal LLMs (mLLMs): Refers to LLMs that have been adapted to take both text and image inputs, usually by learning a mapping from a visual encoder to the LLM input.

- Zero-shot classification: Evaluating the image classification capability of models without providing explicit labels or classifier training.

- Contrastive learning: A technique to align positive text-image pairs in embedding space while pushing negatives apart. Used to train vision-language models like CLIP. 

- Prompt tuning: Adding trainable "prompt" tokens to the input sequence of LLMs to specialize them for downstream tasks while retaining useful knowledge. 

- Read-only prompts: Special prompt tokens that can attend to all tokens but do not impact the representations of the input text tokens. Helps avoid overfitting prompts.

- LoRA: Stands for low-rank adaptation. Performs light fine-tuning by learning low-rank updates to pretrained model weights.

- Generative vs discriminative: Generative models like LLMs focus on modeling the data distribution to generate new samples; discriminative models aim to make predictions. The paper shows LLMs can gain discriminative abilities.

In summary, the key focus is on adapting LLMs to effectively perform image classification in a zero-shot setting while retaining generative capabilities, using techniques like contrastive learning, prompt tuning, and low-rank adaptation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that existing multimodal LLMs do not perform well on zero-shot image classification. What architectural or objective function limitations could explain this poor performance? How does the proposed CLAMP method address those limitations?

2. Read-only prompting is used in CLAMP to append discriminative prompts without shifting representations of text tokens. Explain how the causal attention mask enables read-only prompting to work. Are there any potential downsides or limitations to this approach?  

3. Explain the motivation behind using attention pooling over the output prompt tokens instead of just using the last token embedding like CLIP. What are the tradeoffs between these two pooling approaches?

4. Why is distillation used as part of the training process? What benefits does distilling a stronger CLIP model provide? Could any potential negative effects result from distillation?

5. LoRA is used for lightweight fine-tuning of the LLM parameters. Walk through how LoRA allows efficient low-rank updates. What are the memory and compute advantages relative to full fine-tuning?

6. The paper shows classification accuracy improves with more training data, even when leveraging the strong language prior of an LLM. Why might greater data scale still be hugely impactful? Does this reveal any potential weaknesses of LLMs?

7. Analyze the coverage experiments that reveal when CLAMP outperforms baselines the most. What does this suggest about the strengths of incorporating language priors into discriminative models? When might this be less beneficial?

8. Qualitatively analyze some generation samples from the fine-tuned LLM. To what extent does it retain capabilities despite discriminative fine-tuning? How could generative quality be further preserved?  

9. The paper combines several regularization and prompting strategies. Explore and analyze alternatives not included in the paper like prefix tuning or different adapter approaches. What are the tradeoffs?

10. The zero-shot classification accuracy still seems far from human-level on many datasets. Speculate on what key limitations remain in LLMs or contrastive learning that prevent surpassing human judgment. What innovations could push accuracy even higher?
