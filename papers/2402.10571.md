# [Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a method for aligning language models to human preferences using only binary preference comparisons between model outputs. 
- A limitation of DPO is that it treats all preference pairs equally, rather than accounting for the extent of preference between the two outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Offset DPO (ODPO), which incorporates the difference in quality between two outputs into the loss function when fine-tuning. 
- Specifically, ODPO requires the log probability of the preferred output to exceed that of the non-preferred output by an "offset" term proportional to the difference in their quality scores.

Main Contributions:
- ODPO allows tuning the relative gap between outputs based on human preference strength.
- Experiments on sentiment control, toxicity control, and summarization tasks show ODPO outperforms DPO, especially when limited preference data is available.  
- Ablation studies analyze the effect of different formulations of the offset term.
- The link between ODPO and softmax margin is established.

In summary, the paper introduces Offset DPO as an extension to Direct Preference Optimization to account for extent of human preferences between outputs when fine-tuning language models. Experiments demonstrate improved alignment to human judgments compared to regular DPO.
