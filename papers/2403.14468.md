# [AnyV2V: A Plug-and-Play Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing video-to-video editing methods have limitations in the types of edits they can perform and often require additional tuning or video feature extraction to ensure appearance and temporal consistency. There is a need for a simple, general-purpose framework that can handle diverse video editing tasks with high controllability. 

Proposed Solution - AnyV2V:
The paper proposes AnyV2V, a novel training-free framework for video editing. Key ideas:

1. Decompose video editing into two stages:
   - Use an off-the-shelf image editing model to edit the first frame based on task
   - Use an image-to-video (I2V) model for diffusion model inversion and feature injection

2. Flexible first frame editing via compatibility with various image editors like InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, neural style transfer, AnyDoor etc.

3. Structural guidance via DDIM inversion of source video without text prompt
   - Obtain latents representing structure/motion of source video

4. Appearance guidance via spatial feature injection from I2V model decoder layers 
   - Inject convolution features and spatial attention scores
   - Enforce consistency with background, layout from source video

5. Motion guidance via temporal attention feature injection
   - Inject temporal attention scores from I2V decoder
   - Ensure motion consistency with source video

Main Contributions:

- Introduce AnyV2V, a unified framework for diverse video editing tasks
- First work to perform video editing by harnessing pre-trained I2V models
- Achieve strong performance on tasks like prompt-based editing, reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing etc.
- Compatibility with any image editor, extending them for free to video domain
- Simple, tuning-free approach without needing extra video features

The paper demonstrates AnyV2V's effectiveness quantitatively and qualitatively on several tasks. It also ablates the impact of different components.
