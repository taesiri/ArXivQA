# [Low-power event-based face detection with asynchronous neuromorphic   hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14261)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for low-power, low-latency perception systems that can operate at the edge for real-time applications like object detection. Neuromorphic computing offers promise to tackle this challenge with co-located memory and computing units and event-based asynchronous processing. 
- However, prior work on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for complex vision tasks like object detection has mostly been confined to simulation, with limited demonstrations on actual neuromorphic hardware due to various constraints. There is a need for hardware-aware algorithm development that respects hardware limitations for successful deployment.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents the first instance of an SNN model deployed on the neuromorphic chip Speck for solving a face detection task on the edge while respecting the chip's strict constraints.
- A 4-layer convolutional SNN is proposed and trained off-chip using backpropagation through time. Multi-spike neuron model and firing rate regularization is employed to tackle sim-to-real mismatch and bandwidth limitations.  
- Spike value normalization techniques are explored to leverage multi-spike activations for handling high internal variance.
- Trade-offs between model precision and hardware constraints like power consumption are studied using different levels of firing rate regularization.

Main Contributions:  
- First demonstration of SNN-based object detection model deployment on neuromorphic hardware like Speck.
- Hardware-aware training strategy involving multi-spike modeling and firing rate regularization to respect hardware constraints.
- Analysis of spike value normalization for multi-spike networks to enable deployment.
- Exploration of precision vs power consumption trade-off for chip-compatible model selection using regularization.  
- On-chip face detection mAP of 0.622 achieved while consuming only 19.4mW power, enabled by the proposed training and deployment methodology.
