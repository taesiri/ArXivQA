# [V-IRL: Grounding Virtual Intelligence in Real Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
There is a gap between the sensory experiences of AI agents in simulated environments and the real visual world that humans inhabit. Existing agents lack the rich grounding in real-world sensory data like images, maps, street views etc. that is crucial to develop human-level intelligence that can perceive, interact with and understand the complex physical world.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces Virtual Intelligence in Real Life (VIRL), an open-source platform that embeds AI agents in photo-realistic street-level environments across the globe using real-world geospatial data and imagery. This grounds agents in the diverse visual environments humans encounter and necessitates rich sensory perception for tasks.

Key Capabilities and Components:
- Uses real street-view panoramas and spatial coordinates worldwide for navigation 
- Integrates geographic data like maps, nearby places information for decision-making
- Utilizes vision models for place recognition, object detection etc. 
- Leverages language models for reasoning, summarization, collaboration etc.
- Allows developing interactive and collaborative agents  

Contributions:
- Novel VIRL platform that bridges the realism gap and enables developing perceptually-grounded agents at a global scale
- Demonstrates platform versatility through exemplar agents that solve tasks requiring perception, reasoning and real-world knowledge 
- Introduces global benchmarks to evaluate language and vision models using real-world visual data distributions
- Discusses model robustness and biases when deployed in diverse geographic and cultural contexts

Overall, the paper makes significant strides towards developing AI systems that can perceive, understand and interact with the open-ended real world like humans through its innovative VIRL platform and global-scale sensing capabilities.
