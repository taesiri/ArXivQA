# [INSTA-BNN: Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07439)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question/hypothesis appears to be:

Whether considering per-instance statistical information (e.g. mean, variance, skewness) when determining the binary activation threshold in binary neural networks (BNNs) can improve accuracy compared to using batch-level statistics alone. 

The key ideas and hypotheses seem to be:

- BNNs suffer from accuracy degradation due to the aggressive quantization to only two possible activation values (+1 and -1). Controlling the distribution of the binary activations is critical.

- Previous methods determine the binary activation threshold using batch-level statistics. However, each instance in a batch has different statistical properties.

- Determining a static threshold using only batch statistics may not provide the optimal threshold for every individual input instance. 

- Considering per-instance statistical information like mean, variance, and skewness when computing the binary activation threshold can better capture crucial differences between instances.

- Basing the threshold on instance-wise statistics can significantly improve BNN accuracy.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that instance-aware thresholds that utilize per-instance statistics can improve BNN accuracy over thresholds based solely on batch-level statistics. The authors propose and evaluate an INSTA-BNN method to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a binary neural network (BNN) with instance-aware thresholds for activations, called INSTA-BNN. The key contributions are:

- It argues that using batch-level statistics to determine activation thresholds in BNNs is suboptimal, and instead proposes using instance-wise statistical information like mean, variance, and skewness to compute activation thresholds. 

- It introduces the INSTA-Th module to compute instance-aware thresholds using the cubic moment of the normalized activations. This helps capture mean, variance, and skewness in an efficient way.

- It also proposes an instance-aware PReLU (INSTA-PReLU) to replace the learnable PReLU in prior BNNs. 

- The paper combines the proposed modules with squeeze-and-excitation blocks to further improve accuracy.

- Experiments on ImageNet show the proposed INSTA-BNN outperforms prior BNNs by 2.3-2.5% in top-1 accuracy with comparable compute costs. For example, it achieves 71.7% top-1 accuracy on MobileNetV1, compared to 69.4% for a previous state-of-the-art BNN.

In summary, the key idea is to use instance-level statistics to compute better thresholds for activations in BNNs, instead of using batch-level statistics. This improves accuracy substantially over prior BNNs with minor overheads.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a binary neural network with instance-aware thresholds that considers per-instance statistical information to optimize the thresholds for binarizing activations, achieving improved accuracy compared to prior binary neural networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on binary neural networks compares to other related research:

- It focuses specifically on improving the accuracy of binary neural networks through better methods for thresholding activations. Many papers have looked at training techniques, network architectures, etc. to improve BNN accuracy, but this one targets the core issue of how to binarize activations.

- It proposes an instance-aware approach to determining thresholds, rather than using a fixed or batch-level threshold. Considering each input's statistics is a novel way to set thresholds. Other papers have tried things like learning a fixed threshold per-channel.

- The proposed INSTA-BNN method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy results on ImageNet compared to other BNN techniques. For example, it improves top-1 accuracy by 2.5% over a strong baseline on ResNet-18. This shows its thresholding approach is highly effective.

- Unlike some other work, the paper analytically motivates the need for instance-aware thresholds using things like skewness rather than just proposing an architecture. The ablation studies also verify the impact of each component.

- The INSTA-BNN approach seems broadly compatible with many BNN training methods, network architectures, etc. This could make it easy to integrate with other research.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in addressing a core challenge of BNNs - setting thresholds for binarization. Its instance-aware technique validated on ImageNet outperforms other thresholding approaches and could potentially be combined with complementary BNN research. The analytical motivation and ablation studies are also nice contributions over some related papers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the paper:

1. Investigating other types of instance-wise statistics that could be beneficial for determining thresholds in binary neural networks. In this work, they explored using the mean, variance, and skewness, but other statistical measures could also provide useful information. 

2. Exploring ways to reduce the computational overhead of computing instance-wise statistics. While their proposed methods improve accuracy, calculating statistics for each instance adds some computational cost. Finding ways to reduce this cost would make the approach more practical.

3. Applying the proposed instance-aware thresholding to other types of quantized neural networks beyond binary networks. The authors focused specifically on binary networks in this work, but suggest the approach could be beneficial in networks with low-bit quantization as well.

4. Combining the proposed instance-aware thresholding with other binary neural network techniques like new regularization methods, advanced network architectures, etc. There may be complementary benefits to combining their approach with other BNN methods.

5. Evaluating the approach on additional datasets beyond CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Showing the benefits translate to other data domains would strengthen the general applicability of the method.

In general, the authors propose that exploring additional ways to incorporate instance-wise information into quantized networks is a promising direction for further improving accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Their work provides a starting point along this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for improving the accuracy of binary neural networks (BNNs) called INSTA-BNN. BNNs use low precision weights and activations to reduce memory and computation costs, but suffer from accuracy degradation. The key idea of INSTA-BNN is to use instance-wise statistical information like mean, variance, and skewness of the activations when binarizing each input instance, instead of relying only on batch-level statistics. This allows better control over the thresholding of activations to binary values for each input sample. The authors propose an INSTA-Th module to compute instance-aware thresholds and an INSTA-PReLU module for intermediate activations. They also integrate a squeeze-and-excitation style module for learning channel interdependencies. Experiments on ImageNet classification using ResNet-18 and MobileNet show INSTA-BNN improves accuracy by 2-3% over prior BNN methods with small overhead. The gains demonstrate the importance of using instance-level statistics when binarizing networks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method to improve the accuracy of binary neural networks (BNNs) by using instance-aware thresholds for the binary activations. BNNs use aggressive quantization of weights and activations to 1-bit precision, which reduces memory and computation costs but degrades accuracy. The key idea in this work is that using batch statistics to determine the threshold for binarizing activations is suboptimal, since each input instance can have different statistics. The authors propose computing instance-wise statistics like mean, variance, and skewness of the activations, and using them to set instance-dependent thresholds. This allows better control of the distribution of binary activations for each input. 

The proposed INSTA-BNN method computes instance-wise statistics and uses them to compute thresholds for binarizing activations in each layer. Additional proposed techniques like instance-aware PRELU and combination with squeeze-and-excitation help further boost accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet show that INSTA-BNN versions built on ResNet-18 and MobileNetV1 architectures improve top-1 accuracy by 2.5% and 2.3% over baseline BNNs, achieving 68% and 71.7% accuracy respectively. The gains come with minimal additional compute or memory overhead. The results demonstrate the importance of using instance-specific thresholds in BNNs for better accuracy.
