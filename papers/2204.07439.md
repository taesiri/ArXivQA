# [INSTA-BNN: Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07439)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question/hypothesis appears to be:Whether considering per-instance statistical information (e.g. mean, variance, skewness) when determining the binary activation threshold in binary neural networks (BNNs) can improve accuracy compared to using batch-level statistics alone. The key ideas and hypotheses seem to be:- BNNs suffer from accuracy degradation due to the aggressive quantization to only two possible activation values (+1 and -1). Controlling the distribution of the binary activations is critical.- Previous methods determine the binary activation threshold using batch-level statistics. However, each instance in a batch has different statistical properties.- Determining a static threshold using only batch statistics may not provide the optimal threshold for every individual input instance. - Considering per-instance statistical information like mean, variance, and skewness when computing the binary activation threshold can better capture crucial differences between instances.- Basing the threshold on instance-wise statistics can significantly improve BNN accuracy.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that instance-aware thresholds that utilize per-instance statistics can improve BNN accuracy over thresholds based solely on batch-level statistics. The authors propose and evaluate an INSTA-BNN method to test this hypothesis.
