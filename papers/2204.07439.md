# [INSTA-BNN: Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07439)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question/hypothesis appears to be:

Whether considering per-instance statistical information (e.g. mean, variance, skewness) when determining the binary activation threshold in binary neural networks (BNNs) can improve accuracy compared to using batch-level statistics alone. 

The key ideas and hypotheses seem to be:

- BNNs suffer from accuracy degradation due to the aggressive quantization to only two possible activation values (+1 and -1). Controlling the distribution of the binary activations is critical.

- Previous methods determine the binary activation threshold using batch-level statistics. However, each instance in a batch has different statistical properties.

- Determining a static threshold using only batch statistics may not provide the optimal threshold for every individual input instance. 

- Considering per-instance statistical information like mean, variance, and skewness when computing the binary activation threshold can better capture crucial differences between instances.

- Basing the threshold on instance-wise statistics can significantly improve BNN accuracy.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that instance-aware thresholds that utilize per-instance statistics can improve BNN accuracy over thresholds based solely on batch-level statistics. The authors propose and evaluate an INSTA-BNN method to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a binary neural network (BNN) with instance-aware thresholds for activations, called INSTA-BNN. The key contributions are:

- It argues that using batch-level statistics to determine activation thresholds in BNNs is suboptimal, and instead proposes using instance-wise statistical information like mean, variance, and skewness to compute activation thresholds. 

- It introduces the INSTA-Th module to compute instance-aware thresholds using the cubic moment of the normalized activations. This helps capture mean, variance, and skewness in an efficient way.

- It also proposes an instance-aware PReLU (INSTA-PReLU) to replace the learnable PReLU in prior BNNs. 

- The paper combines the proposed modules with squeeze-and-excitation blocks to further improve accuracy.

- Experiments on ImageNet show the proposed INSTA-BNN outperforms prior BNNs by 2.3-2.5% in top-1 accuracy with comparable compute costs. For example, it achieves 71.7% top-1 accuracy on MobileNetV1, compared to 69.4% for a previous state-of-the-art BNN.

In summary, the key idea is to use instance-level statistics to compute better thresholds for activations in BNNs, instead of using batch-level statistics. This improves accuracy substantially over prior BNNs with minor overheads.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a binary neural network with instance-aware thresholds that considers per-instance statistical information to optimize the thresholds for binarizing activations, achieving improved accuracy compared to prior binary neural networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on binary neural networks compares to other related research:

- It focuses specifically on improving the accuracy of binary neural networks through better methods for thresholding activations. Many papers have looked at training techniques, network architectures, etc. to improve BNN accuracy, but this one targets the core issue of how to binarize activations.

- It proposes an instance-aware approach to determining thresholds, rather than using a fixed or batch-level threshold. Considering each input's statistics is a novel way to set thresholds. Other papers have tried things like learning a fixed threshold per-channel.

- The proposed INSTA-BNN method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy results on ImageNet compared to other BNN techniques. For example, it improves top-1 accuracy by 2.5% over a strong baseline on ResNet-18. This shows its thresholding approach is highly effective.

- Unlike some other work, the paper analytically motivates the need for instance-aware thresholds using things like skewness rather than just proposing an architecture. The ablation studies also verify the impact of each component.

- The INSTA-BNN approach seems broadly compatible with many BNN training methods, network architectures, etc. This could make it easy to integrate with other research.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in addressing a core challenge of BNNs - setting thresholds for binarization. Its instance-aware technique validated on ImageNet outperforms other thresholding approaches and could potentially be combined with complementary BNN research. The analytical motivation and ablation studies are also nice contributions over some related papers.
