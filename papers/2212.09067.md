# [Fine-Tuning Is All You Need to Mitigate Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09067)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether fine-tuning can effectively mitigate backdoor attacks against machine learning models. The key hypothesis is that fine-tuning, a simple and common technique in machine learning, can remove backdoors from models while maintaining high utility. The authors evaluate this hypothesis across three machine learning paradigms: encoder-based learning, transfer learning, and standalone models. They introduce a new "super-fine-tuning" method and show it is effective at removing different types of backdoor attacks. They also coin the term "backdoor sequela" to analyze the impact of defenses on model vulnerability. In summary, the paper explores whether fine-tuning can serve as an easy yet powerful defense against backdoors, challenging prior beliefs that complex defenses are necessary. The central hypothesis is that with proper tuning of hyperparameters like learning rate, fine-tuning can eliminate backdoors while preserving accuracy.
