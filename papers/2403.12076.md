# [Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12076)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional Hebbian Learning (HL) models for neural networks focus on updating synaptic weights based on pre- and post-synaptic neuron activations. This means each synapse has its own set of Hebbian rule parameters to optimize, leading to a large overall parameter space.
- As the number of synapses grows, optimizing traditional HL models becomes very computationally demanding. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning (NcHL) model where the Hebbian rule parameters are associated with neurons rather than synapses. 
- Since the number of neurons is much smaller than the number of synapses, this greatly reduces the number of parameters to optimize while still allowing for specialization of synaptic updates.
- A "weightless" version is also proposed (WNcHL) which approximates weights based on a limited history of neuron activations, removing the need to store weight values.

Contributions:
- Introduces a paradigm shift in HL by moving from synapse-centric to neuron-centric rules, significantly reducing parametrization.
- Shows NcHL reaches comparable performance to traditional HL on two robotic locomotion tasks despite using up to ~97 times less parameters.
- Proposes a WNcHL model that reduces memory requirements for weights by ~99.7% while losing only 17-37% task performance. 
- Provides insights into how NcHL and traditional HL explore behavior space similarly.
- Allows more scalable application of Hebbian plasticity while preserving biological plausibility.

In summary, the paper makes Hebbian Learning more scalable by reducing the number of parameters through a neuron-centric approach, while achieving comparable performance. The weightless version trades some performance for large memory savings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel plasticity model called Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning (NcHL) which focuses the Hebbian learning rule on neurons rather than synapses, achieving comparable performance to traditional Hebbian learning models while requiring substantially fewer parameters to optimize.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel plasticity model called Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning (NcHL). The key ideas behind NcHL are:

1) It shifts the focus of the Hebbian learning rule from synapses to neurons. In traditional Hebbian learning models like the ABCD rule, each synapse has its own set of plasticity parameters that need to be optimized. In contrast, in NcHL the plasticity parameters are associated with neurons rather than synapses. 

2) This neuron-centric approach leads to a massive reduction in the number of plasticity parameters that need to be optimized, from scaling with the number of synapses to just the number of neurons. Since the number of neurons is typically much smaller than the number of synapses in a neural network, this makes training more efficient.

3) The authors show through experiments on simulated robotic control tasks that NcHL can achieve comparable performance to traditional synapse-centric Hebbian learning, despite having far fewer parameters to optimize. This demonstrates the efficiency of the neuron-centric approach.

4) The authors also propose a "weightless" version of NcHL that does not require storing weight values, only neuron activations over a short time window. This leads to additional memory savings.

In summary, the key novelty is the neuron-centric perspective on Hebbian learning that enables major gains in efficiency and scalability while preserving performance. This opens up new directions for developing biologically plausible yet practical learning algorithms.

The paper proposes a novel plasticity model called Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning (NcHL) which focuses the Hebbian learning rule on neurons rather than synapses. This reduces the number of parameters to optimize compared to traditional Synaptic-centric Hebbian Learning models. The authors also propose a "weightless" version called WNcHL which approximates the weights based on neuron activations, further reducing memory requirements. These models are tested on simulated robotic locomotion tasks involving VSRs and compared against traditional Hebbian Learning rules like the ABCD rule. The evolution strategies used to optimize the models are also key terms. Overall, the core focus is on neural network plasticity and pruning through neuroevolution methods.
