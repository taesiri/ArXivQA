# [High-Fidelity Image Compression with Score-based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether score-based generative models like diffusion models can match or exceed the performance of GANs for the task of learned image compression, especially at high resolutions. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) A simple but theoretically motivated two-stage approach combining an MSE autoencoder with a score-based generative model can achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality in terms of FID score while maintaining low bitrates.

2) Diffusion models can significantly improve perceptual quality compared to recent GAN-based compression methods like HiFiC and PO-ELIC, if properly tuned for the compression task. 

3) Details like the noise schedule and sampling procedure are very important for getting good performance with diffusion models in compression. In particular, less noise and more emphasis on fine details is beneficial compared to settings used in other domains like text-to-image generation.

4) While computationally more expensive, diffusion models can surpass recent state-of-the-art in terms of the rate-distortion tradeoff if enough sampling steps are used. With fewer steps, rectified flows perform better but are eventually overtaken.

The core aim seems to be demonstrating the potential of score-based generative models in the compression domain through both theoretical motivation and empirical results, challenging the notion that GANs are superior for this application.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a new method for high-fidelity image compression using score-based generative models. The main contributions are:

- They propose a two-stage approach combining an autoencoder optimized for MSE with a diffusion model or rectified flow to generate realistic details. This improves perceptual quality compared to just using the MSE autoencoder.

- They adapt diffusion models for compression by using a shifted noise schedule focused on details rather than global structure. This is different from how diffusion is used in text-to-image models.

- They achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CLIC and COCO datasets in terms of the rate-FID tradeoff, outperforming recent GAN-based compression methods. 

- They explore implementation details like noise levels during sampling and parallel patch-based generation to make diffusion viable for high resolution images.

- They highlight challenges like denoising effects and distortion vs realism tradeoffs faced when optimizing for perceptual metrics like FID.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that diffusion models can achieve excellent perceptual quality for image compression when properly adapted to this domain, outperforming GANs which currently dominate learned compression. The theoretical analysis and practical insights around making diffusion work are also valuable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a two-stage image compression approach combining a standard autoencoder with a diffusion-based generative model to achieve improved perceptual quality and realism compared to previous methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on compression with generative models:

- This paper focuses on using diffusion models for compression, whereas much prior work has used GANs. Diffusion has shown great success in unconditional image generation, but has lagged behind GANs for conditional tasks like compression. This paper helps close that gap.

- The two-stage approach of using an MSE autoencoder followed by a diffusion model is relatively simple conceptually, but shows strong results. Other work has explored more tightly integrated use of diffusion models and entropy coding. However, the modular approach here allows leveraging highly optimized autoencoders.

- The authors put emphasis on tuning the diffusion model for the compression task, rather than just reusing models for text-to-image generation. Details like the noise schedule are adapted. This highlights that compression places different demands on the generative model compared to unconditioned generation.

- Results surpass recent GAN-based compression methods like HiFiC and PO-ELIC in terms of FID, showing diffusion models can achieve state-of-the-art visual quality. However, distortion metrics like PSNR lag behind. There is a tradeoff between perceptual quality and fidelity. 

- Compared to the only other diffusion approach for high-res compression, DIRAC, this work achieves substantially better FID scores. This suggests the architectural improvements for generating high-res images in computer vision translate to compression as well.

Overall, this work pushes the state-of-the-art for generative compression by adapting diffusion models to this application. The visual quality results are very promising, though distortion performance lags behind other methods. The techniques here likely point the way towards further work on leveraging diffusion for compression and other conditional generation tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the sampling speed of diffusion-based compression approaches using techniques like progressive distillation. The authors note that their diffusion models can be computationally expensive due to the large number of sampling steps required. Methods like progressive distillation could help reduce this cost.

- Exploring random coding approaches with shared randomness between the encoder and decoder. The authors mention that this could help further improve the theoretical rate-distortion performance. However, these techniques are currently impractical due to the high cost of communicating the shared random code.

- Evaluating the approach on more diverse and larger-scale datasets. The authors mainly evaluated on standard datasets like Kodak, CLIC, and COCO. Testing on newer and more varied datasets could give further insight.

- Developing improved metrics beyond PSNR and FID that better capture perceptual quality and fine details. The authors note limitations of current metrics, especially for neural compression methods. New metrics would help better evaluate progress.

- Extending the approach to video compression. The current work focuses on images, but video presents additional challenges like motion modeling that could be interesting to explore with diffusion models.

- Improving performance on small faces and other fine details at very low bitrates. The authors acknowledge this is still a challenge for their method.

- Combining ideas from other state-of-the-art neural compression techniques like ELIC and HiFiC to further advance performance.

In summary, the main directions are improving efficiency and scaling of diffusion models, exploring theoretical rate-distortion limits, benchmarking on more diverse data, developing better evaluation metrics, and adapting the approach to video and other modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a high-fidelity image compression method using score-based generative models. It combines a standard autoencoder optimized for MSE with a diffusion model or rectified flow model to add realistic details. The autoencoder provides a lossy encoding of the image that is stored efficiently. The generative model then samples from the posterior distribution of images given the autoencoder output to hallucinate missing details and create a more realistic reconstruction. The method shifts the noise schedule compared to text-to-image models so that diffusion focuses more on fine details rather than global structure. Experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores compared to recent compression methods like HiFiC and PO-ELIC, especially at very low bitrates, though at the cost of lower PSNR. Implementation details like patch-based generation and reduced noise levels during sampling are found to be important. The method demonstrates the potential of score-based models for high-fidelity generative image compression.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for high-fidelity image compression using diffusion generative models. The approach involves first compressing the image using a standard autoencoder optimized for MSE. This compressed image is then fed into a denoising diffusion model which adds realistic detail that was lost by the autoencoder. The diffusion model is conditioned on the autoencoder output and iteratively denoises it over multiple steps. The authors find that shifting the noise schedule towards less noise improves performance, as the autoencoder already captures the global structure well so the diffusion model should focus more on fine details. They also generate images patch-by-patch in parallel to handle arbitrary resolutions. 

The proposed approach, called high-fidelity diffusion (HFD), is shown to achieve state-of-the-art FID scores compared to other neural compression methods like HiFiC and recent approaches based on GANs. This demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to reach high perceptual quality in generative compression. However, the increased realism comes at the cost of lower PSNR compared to other methods. Qualitative examples show HFD can generate convincing details even at very low bit-rates. Limitations are that it may over-denoise or hallucinate details incorrectly. Overall, the work makes important progress towards bringing the success of diffusion models in unconditional image generation to the domain of learned image compression.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage approach for image compression using diffusion models. First, a standard autoencoder is trained to compress the image by optimizing for MSE. This autoencoder reconstruction is then fed into a denoising diffusion model which iteratively adds realistic details that were lost during the autoencoder compression. The diffusion model is conditioned on the autoencoder output and trained to denoise noisy versions of the original image. Key details include using a shifted noise schedule focused on adding high frequency detail rather than global structure, and modifications to allow out-painting image patches in parallel during sampling. This two-stage approach of autoencoder plus diffusion model is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of the FID score compared to other generative compression methods, especially at low bit-rates, while using a simple and theoretically justified framework.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to improve the perceptual quality and realism of image compression using diffusion generative models. 

Some key questions the paper investigates:

- Can diffusion models match or exceed the performance of GANs for the task of generative image compression, as they have done in other image generation tasks?

- What modifications to the typical diffusion model training procedure and architecture are needed to optimize them for compression rather than general image synthesis?

- How sensitive is compression performance to details like the noise schedule and sampling procedure?

- Can diffusion models reach state-of-the-art compression performance on benchmark datasets compared to recent GAN-based compression methods?

So in summary, the main focus is on adapting diffusion models specifically for high-fidelity generative image compression and demonstrating they can achieve better perceptual quality than existing state-of-the-art neural compression techniques. The paper explores model architecture, training methodology, and evaluates performance on standard datasets to address this question.
