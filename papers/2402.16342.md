# [Contingency Planning Using Bi-level Markov Decision Processes for Space   Missions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scientific missions like NASA's VIPER rover face challenges in autonomous contingency planning, i.e. quickly computing alternative traverse plans from any off-nominal state caused by delays or deviations. 
- The large action space (different movements at different speeds) and long planning horizons (months) make it computationally intractable to solve as one monolithic MDP.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the problem as a bi-level MDP which aligns with existing mission planning paradigms. 
- The high-level MDP decides which science target to visit next.
- Separate low-level MDPs then plan the detailed path to reach each target selected by the high-level MDP.
- Reduce state and action spaces in each level to improve computational tractability.
- Trade-off optimality for faster computation by using a heuristic high-level transition function.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce RoverGridWorld to simulate rover path planning scenarios with time-sensitive constraints.
- Propose a framework to convert a mission planning MDP into a bi-level MDP using a few additional mission-specific inputs.
- Demonstrate on RoverGridWorld problems that the bi-level MDP achieves near-optimal rewards (e.g. 78% optimal) with much less computation time (e.g. 13% of optimal solver time).
- Show computation time improvements increase as problem complexity grows in terms of state/action space and planning horizons.
- Enable quick generation of contingency branches from any off-nominal state.

In summary, the paper presents a bi-level MDP approach for efficient autonomous rover path planning that is near-optimal, computationally tractable, and aligns with existing mission planning paradigms.
