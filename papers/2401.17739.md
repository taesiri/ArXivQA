# [Operator learning without the adjoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper considers the problem of approximating non-self-adjoint (non-symmetric) operators from input-output data pairs without access to the action of the adjoint operator. 

- This is practically relevant as many partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise in science and engineering are non-self-adjoint but machine learning techniques seem to succeed in learning them without requiring data from the adjoint operator which may be unavailable. 

- The paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of when and why neural network models can recover non-self-adjoint operators without the adjoint.

Proposed Solution
- In finite dimensions, the paper shows fundamental limits to low-rank matrix recovery without the adjoint in terms of how close the matrix is to symmetric. This suggests additional structure/knowledge is needed in infinite dimensions.

- The key theoretical contribution is an adjoint-free operator learning approach that exploits regularity properties of a self-adjoint prior operator to approximate the range of a non-self-adjoint operator's adjoint. This leads to guaranteed error bounds.

- The method projects the non-self-adjoint operator onto eigenfunctions of the prior self-adjoint operator, e.g. the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Explicit convergence rates are derived for approximating operators associated with PDEs.

- For perturbed self-adjoint PDEs, the bound reveals a linear dependence on perturbation size, matching experiments showing performance of standard deep learning techniques degrades linearly with increased non-self-adjointness.

Main Contributions
- Provides first theoretical analysis of adjoint-free operator learning, attempting to close gap between theory and practice

- Demonstrates limits of low-rank matrix recovery without adjoint access 

- Introduces new Fourier projection framework for operators by exploiting favorable properties of self-adjoint prior operators

- Derives sample complexity bounds and convergence rates for approximating operators associated with PDEs

- Reveals linear dependence of performance on degree of non-self-adjointness, confirmed numerically using deep learning techniques

In summary, the paper makes significant theoretical progress on understanding the surprising effectiveness of deep learning techniques at recovering non-self-adjoint operators without using data from the unavailable adjoint operator. The analysis and bounds provided are shown to accurately reflect the actual behavior of standard deep learning methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces the problem of efficiently approximating non-self-adjoint operators from queries of their action without access to the corresponding adjoint operator, provides analysis on when and why this is possible for certain classes of operators, and applies the theory to numerically approximate solution operators of perturbed elliptic PDEs without needing to solve the adjoint problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the theory of operator learning, especially for non-self-adjoint operators:

1) It provides the first analysis of recovering non-self-adjoint operators from data without access to the adjoint operator. Prior works either assumed access to the adjoint or focused only on self-adjoint operators. This paper attempts to close the gap between theory and practice where adjoint-free operator learning has shown empirical success.

2) It shows fundamental limitations of low-rank matrix recovery without the adjoint, providing matching upper and lower bounds. This highlights why the adjoint is typically needed for efficient matrix/operator recovery. 

3) It introduces an adjoint-free operator learning approach that leverages regularization properties of a prior self-adjoint operator (such as the Laplace-Beltrami operator) to obtain guaranteed convergence rates. This is the first convergent adjoint-free operator learning method.

4) For perturbation theory of elliptic PDE operators, it derives approximation error bounds that scale linearly with the size of the perturbation. This behavior matches what is observed empirically in deep learning experiments, helping explain why deep models do not need the adjoint.

In summary, the key contribution is providing the first theoretical analysis of adjoint-free operator learning, introducing a provably convergent method, and explaining why deep learning succeeds without the adjoint for PDE problems. The analysis aims to close the gap between theory and practice in this area.

The paper analyzes the problem of learning non-self-adjoint operators, such as those associated with convection-diffusion PDEs, without access to data from the adjoint operator. It leverages regularization properties of operators like the Laplace-Beltrami operator to provide approximation guarantees and sample complexity bounds in the adjoint-free setting. Key results include operator approximation bounds using eigenfunction expansions and perturbation analysis quantifying how accuracy degrades as operators become more non-normal.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper states "Current practical approaches suggest that one can accurately recover an operator while only using data generated by the forward action of the operator without access to the adjoint." What are some of these practical approaches and what evidence do they provide to support this claim? How might the results in this paper explain their success?

2. The paper exploits regularity properties of the adjoint operator as prior information to construct approximations without access to the adjoint. What other types of prior information could potentially be leveraged in a similar manner? For example, could sparsity or low-rank structure be exploited?  

3. The choice of the self-adjoint operator $L$ that serves as a prior seems critical for ensuring the quality of approximation. What strategies are proposed in the paper for selecting a suitable $L$? How might one systematically determine an optimal choice of $L$? 

4. The analysis relies heavily on spectral properties of the prior operator $L$ and projection onto its eigenfunctions. However, the eigendecomposition may be prohibitively expensive to perform in practice. Could similar guarantees be derived for projection onto a fixed basis that approximates eigenvalues/eigenfunctions of $L$?

5. How sharp are the derived error bounds? Could the dependence on problem parameters such as eigenvalue decay rates and regularization constants be improved? Are the bounds tight for certain operators?

6. The linear dependence of the error bounds on the convection coefficient as perturbations increase matches what is observed empirically. Is there evidence that this relationship continues to hold for larger perturbations beyond what the analysis can currently handle?  

7. The approximation scheme requires evaluating the operator $A$ at eigenfunctions of $L$. Is this viewpoint related to other operator approximation techniques like Neumann series? Could connections lead to improvements?

8. The analysis focuses on recovering properties of the operator $A$ itself. How do the guarantees translate to recovery of quantities of interest such as solutions to PDEs governed by $A$?

9. The numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed method but do not benchmark against other techniques. How competitive is the approach compared to standard operator learning methods that access the adjoint? What are its advantages/disadvantages?

10. How might the error bounds change for other function spaces, operators, and notions of convergence besides the operator norm? Does the requirement for the range of the adjoint to be a subset of the domain of $L$ limit applicability?
