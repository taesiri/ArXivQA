# [LLM Augmented LLMs: Expanding Capabilities through Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Foundation models like LLMs have shown promise in many domains but augmenting them with new capabilities is challenging as it requires expensive further pretraining or fine-tuning. 
- On the other hand, many specialized models are being developed with domain-specific capabilities.
- The paper studies the problem of efficiently composing an anchor foundation LLM with specialized augmenting models to enable new capabilities, without modifying the base models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Composition to Augment Language Models (CALM) which introduces cross-attention between the anchor and augmenting models. 
- CALM keeps model weights frozen and learns projections to align dimensions and cross-attention over layer representations to enable interaction.
- Only a small amount of data representing the combined capability is used to learn the composition.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates CALM in three domains - mapping string keys to values for arithmetic, expanding language coverage using models trained on low-resource languages, and code understanding by composing with code-specific models.
- Shows significant gains over base models in translation, reasoning, code completion etc. with minimal training.
- Establishes that specialized models can efficiently impart new capabilities to foundation models via representation composition, avoiding expensive further pretraining.
- Opens up ability for foundation models to acquire distinct skills from multiple domain-specific models.

In summary, the paper presents a practical and scalable approach for model composition that can expand capabilities of large language models through cross-attention over specialized models, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Composition to Augment Language Models (CALM), a method to compose a large language model with specialized smaller models to enable new capabilities and tasks by introducing cross-attention between the models' intermediate layer representations, without modifying the individual models' weights.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CALM (Composition to Augment Language Models), a framework to compose a large anchor language model with smaller specialized augmenting models to enable new capabilities and tasks. Key aspects of CALM include:

- It introduces cross-attention between the anchor and augmenting models to learn an effective combination of their representations for performing new tasks.

- It keeps the weights of the individual anchor and augmenting models frozen, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of their capabilities.

- It requires only a small amount of additional parameters and training data depicting the target composed task, making it practical and scalable.

- Experiments show it can effectively transfer and compose capabilities from specialized models for low-resource language translation, arithmetic reasoning, and code understanding/generation tasks.

So in summary, CALM provides a practical approach to augment existing large language models to expand their capabilities through composition, while avoiding expensive further pre-training or fine-tuning of the models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Composition to Augment Language Models (CALM) - The name of the proposed framework to compose a large language model (anchor model) with a specialized smaller model (augmenting model) to enable new capabilities.

- Anchor model - The large language model that serves as the base model to be augmented. Examples used in the paper include PaLM-XS and PaLM-S.

- Augmenting model - The smaller, specialized model that is composed with the anchor model to provide additional capabilities. Examples include models trained on low-resource languages, code, etc.

- Cross-attention - The key mechanism used to enable interaction between the frozen anchor and augmenting models' intermediate representations.

- Low-resource language translation - One of the tasks used to demonstrate composing an anchor model with one trained on low-resource languages.

- Code generation and explanation - Tasks used to show composing an anchor model with one specialized in code.

- Parameter efficient - A key motivation is efficiently expanding capabilities without extensive fine-tuning or modifying anchor model.

- Modularity - Building from discrete skills of existing models; avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

- Re-use - Leveraging existing model capabilities instead of retraining specialized models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does CALM differ from traditional approaches like adapter modules or LoRA when it comes to efficiently adapting large language models? What are the advantages of using cross-attention between frozen models over these methods?

2. The paper mentions using a small amount of "combined skills" data for training the composition parameters. What constitutes this data and how is it constructed? How does the choice of this data impact the quality of the composed model? 

3. The paper demonstrates composition between models with different architectures and objectives. What challenges does this pose compared to composing models derived from the same architecture? How does CALM address these challenges?

4. The parametric overhead introduced by CALM seems quite small compared to the anchor model size. Does this also translate to minimal training overhead? Explain the factors that contribute to the training costs.

5. How does CALM balance routing across models vs combining representations in an implicit way? What patterns do we see in the qualitative examples that provide evidence of this?

6. When would composing using CALM be preferred over conventional fine-tuning of the anchor model? What constraints make CALM a better alternative?

7. The paper focuses on a single anchor + single augmenting model case. How can the framework be extended for multiple augmentations? What additional complexities need to be handled?

8. What architectural choices were made in CALM regarding selection of layers, positional embeddings etc. when combining models with different architectures? How do these impact composition quality?

9. The paper demonstrates promising quantitative gains across tasks when specializing the augmenting model. Are there cases/tasks where a non-specialized or random augmenting model would suffice?

10. The target tasks considered currently evaluate the model in a zero/few-shot setting. Would the gains translate if the entire composed model is fine-tuned end-to-end on downstream tasks?
