# [DeepLINK-T: deep learning inference for time series data using knockoffs   and LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High-dimensional time series data is prevalent in many real-world applications like biomedicine and finance. Feature selection from such data to identify important variables is crucial but challenging. 
- Existing methods either rely on p-values which are not suitable for complex models like deep neural networks, or focus on independent data without considering serial dependency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DeepLINK-T, a new method that combines deep learning with knockoffs framework for feature selection from time series data with control of false discovery rate (FDR).

Key Components:
- Uses LSTM autoencoder to generate knockoff variables that incorporate time dependencies. 
- Constructs an LSTM prediction network on original and knockoff variables to get knockoff statistics.
- Applies model-X knockoffs framework for feature selection using knockoff statistics while controlling FDR.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a way to construct knockoffs and perform feature selection for time series data using deep learning models. 
- Controls FDR which is a crucial metric for assessing feature selection methods.
- Simulation studies show DeepLINK-T has higher power and better FDR control than non-time series method.
- Analysis of three metagenomic datasets demonstrates ability to provide biological insights by identifying relevant microbial taxa.
- Overall, DeepLINK-T advances feature selection for time series data and promises to enable discovery in complex real-world applications.
