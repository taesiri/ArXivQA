# [User-customizable Shared Control for Fine Teleoperation via Virtual   Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13177)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Shared control can assist humans in teleoperating robots, but the arbitration process controlling the blending between autonomy and user can confuse operators and limit understanding of robot behavior.
- Prior "customizable" shared control methods allowed users to indirectly modify arbitration parameters through issuing feedback commands, but these parameters remained latent/hidden from users.

Proposed Solution:
- Novel shared control framework that makes arbitration parameters directly observable and editable, enabling users to personalize to their preferences. 
- Parameters communicated to user via human-interpretable visualizations in VR (e.g. spider chart showing speed, depth assistance).
- User makes discrete parameter updates through interface (e.g. slider) that directly maps to arbitration function.

- Instantiate framework on 6-DOF teleoperation task - buzz wire game played using VR headset to control robotic arm end-effector through potential field-based shared control policy.

- Conduct longitudinal user study across 2 weeks with 12 subjects playing buzz wire game under 3 conditions: direct teleoperation, heuristics-based shared control, and proposed user-customizable shared control.

Contributions:
- Mathematical formulation for user-customizable shared control using feedback channel between human and robot arbitration components.
- Demonstration of formulation enabling transparent editing of arbitration parameters for assistive 6-DOF teleoperation task.
- User study findings showing proposed method helps users generalize to task variations better than alternatives, with reduced collisions and jerk.

The key insight is to make the previously latent arbitration parameters directly observable and editable by users through explicit visualizations and interfaces supplied to them. This transparent customizability enhances understanding of robot behavior and longitudinal adaptability.
