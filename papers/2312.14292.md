# [Benchmarking Multi-Agent Preference-based Reinforcement Learning for   Human-AI Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores using Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) for human-AI teaming scenarios, where both the human and AI agent act in the environment to accomplish a shared team task. PbRL has shown promise in single-agent settings for incorporating human preferences, but its application in multi-agent scenarios with human-in-the-loop has been unexplored. The key challenges are that the AI agent must understand the human's strategy, adapt its own policy accordingly, and elicit the human's preferences for the team behavior.

Solution:
The paper introduces a Human-AI PbRL cooperation game formulation based on Cooperative Inverse RL. It adapts single-agent PbRL methods like PEBBLE, SURF and RUNE to this two-agent cooperative setting. Two key aspects studied are:
1) Human Flexibility: Whether the human considers multiple feasible team strategies or has a specific policy in mind. 
2) Access to Human Policy: Whether the agent has access to human actions during training to understand their policy.

A notion of Specified Orchestration is discussed which assumes the human has a single policy and gives full access, serving as a loose upper bound for algorithm performance.

Contributions:
1) First exploration of extending PbRL to human-AI teaming scenarios
2) Suite of cooperative domains requiring forced human-AI cooperation 
3) Empirical benchmarking of PbRL algorithms on the domains, analyzing impact of Human Flexibility and Access to Human Policy
4) Findings showing PbRL methods are only effective under Specified Orchestration, highlighting challenges in modeling human behavior and preferences in multi-agent settings

The work provides a formulation and benchmark suite to motivate further research in this direction. Key open challenges identified are explicitly modeling human policy and reward learning under flexibility in human behavior.
