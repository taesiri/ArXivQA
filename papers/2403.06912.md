## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DNGaussian: Optimizing Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Radiance Fields with Global-Local Depth Normalization":

Problem:
- Novel view synthesis from sparse input views is challenging for radiance fields like neural radiance fields (NeRF). Most methods suffer from high training costs and slow inference. 
- Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown impressive performance for novel view synthesis using a set of 3D Gaussian primitives. However, its quality degrades significantly with sparse input views due to incorrectly learned scene geometry.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DNGaussian, a framework to optimize sparse-view 3D Gaussian radiance fields using depth normalization. 
- The key insight is that the geometry degradation is primarily due to incorrect positioning of the Gaussian primitives, which can be mitigated by depth constraints.
- A Hard and Soft Depth Regularization is proposed to move the Gaussian primitives to restore geometry without compromising color details.
- A Global-Local Depth Normalization focuses the depth loss on small local changes in a scale-invariant way to refine geometry.  

Main Contributions:
- Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to constrain geometry by encouraging movement of Gaussians, enabling depth-regularized spatial reshaping without color quality loss.
- Global-Local Depth Normalization that normalizes depth locally to refocus on small errors while maintaining global scale knowledge.
- DNGaussian framework combining above techniques for fast and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis. It achieves state-of-the-art quality with $25\times$ less training time and $3000\times$ faster rendering than current methods.

In summary, the paper introduces depth regularization techniques tailored for optimizing sparse-view 3D Gaussian radiance fields, enabling efficient high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis. The proposed DNGaussian framework sets new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
