# [Root Cause Analysis In Microservice Using Neural Granger Causal   Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01140)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Microservices bring benefits like scalability and flexibility but also complex dependencies that make root cause analysis challenging when issues arise. 
- Existing methods for root cause analysis in microservices rely on similarity or PC algorithm, ignoring important temporal dependencies in time series data.
- Neural Granger causality discovery methods also fail to leverage contextual information in time series data effectively.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose RUN, a framework that uses neural Granger causality with contrastive learning for root cause analysis.
- A self-supervised contrastive learning method is introduced that treats identical timestamps with different contexts as positive pairs. This captures contextual information without risk of erroneous negative pairs.
- Neural Granger causality discovery is done using independent forecasting models and a causal attention matrix to construct a causal graph. 
- The causal graph is analyzed with personalized PageRank to produce a ranking of likely root causes.

Main Contributions:
- An innovative self-supervised contrastive learning approach for time series that only uses identical timestamps as positive pairs.
- A neural Granger causality discovery method tailored for root cause analysis in microservices.
- Extensive experiments on synthetic and real microservice data showing RUN outperforms existing methods significantly. 
- Analysis of a use case demonstrating how RUN can effectively construct a causal graph and locate the root cause.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel framework called RUN that leverages neural Granger causality and contrastive learning of time series data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on root cause analysis in microservices. A key innovation is the self-supervised contrastive learning method to capture contextual information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes RUN, a novel framework for root cause analysis in microservices using neural Granger causal discovery with contrastive learning to capture temporal dependencies between time series data and identify root causes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a self-supervised neural Granger causal discovery-based root cause analysis framework called RUN, which captures contextual information in temporal data and leverages a time series forecasting model to construct a causal graph between multivariate time series for identifying root causes.

2. Introducing an innovative self-supervised learning method for time series data that exclusively treats identical timestamps with distinct contextual information as positive pairs. This prevents misidentifying timestamps with similar periodicity as negative pairs and separating representations that should be similar. 

3. Demonstrating that RUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic datasets and data generated from a real-world microservice application. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel neural Granger causal discovery framework called RUN for effectively conducting root cause analysis in microservices by capturing temporal dependencies and contextual information in time series data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called RUN. What are the three main stages in this framework and what does each stage aim to achieve? Please explain in detail.

2. The paper utilizes a self-supervised learning scheme for time series contrastive learning. Why does the paper argue that simply treating different timestamps as negative pairs can be problematic for time series data? Please expand on this point.

3. The paper claims that previous works on neural Granger causal discovery did not effectively leverage contextual information in time series data. What specifically does the paper propose to capture contextual information and why is this important?

4. In the pre-training stage, the paper enhances the backbone encoder using contrastive learning without relying on negative pairs. What is the motivation behind not using negative pairs here? How could the inclusion of incorrect negative pairs adversely impact the model?

5. In the neural Granger causal discovery stage, the paper describes forecasting each time series using independent neural networks. Why is an independent model used for each time series instead of a shared model? What are the advantages?  

6. The diagnosis stage uses PageRank to identify the root cause. Can you explain why the access distance calculation was changed compared to the original GrootRank method? What problem was this trying to address?

7. The ablation study showed that removing negative pairs did not significantly impact performance on the sock-shop dataset. What reason does the paper give to potentially explain this result? Do you agree with this hypothesis?

8. For the synthetic datasets, the performance of RUN is less competitive compared to the causal discovery baselines. Why do the authors think this is the case? Do you believe this is a fair comparison or limitation?

9. The paper demonstrates a case study that showcases how the derived causal graph can explain the identification of the root cause. Can you walk through this example and how it validates the efficacy of the proposed approach? 

10. The paper mentions a number of promising future research directions. Which one do you think is the most important to pursue next and why? What challenges need to be addressed there?
