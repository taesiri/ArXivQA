# [One More Step: A Versatile Plug-and-Play Module for Rectifying Diffusion   Schedule Flaws and Enhancing Low-Frequency Controls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15744)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel plug-and-play module called One More Step (OMS) to enhance the ability of pre-trained diffusion models to generate images across a diverse range of brightness levels. The authors identify an inconsistency between training and inference where models are trained on data with residual low-frequency components but tested on pure Gaussian noise. To address this, OMS trains an auxiliary network to map the pure noise to match the data distribution seen during training. After this additional step, sampling proceeds as usual using the original pre-trained model parameters. A key advantage is that OMS works for both epsilon and v-prediction models without any fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that OMS allows models like Stable Diffusion to produce much higher-fidelity images better matching prompt specifications of brightness or color. The compact OMS module sees limited performance gains from additional parameters or different text encoders. Qualitative and quantitative results on COCO and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness and versatility of OMS to enhance generation diversity across base models and their variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a plug-and-play module called One More Step to enhance diffusion models by adding an additional inference step to bridge the gap between the training and sampling distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "One More Step" (OMS) to address the issue of generated images from diffusion models gravitating towards medium brightness levels. Specifically:

- The paper identifies a discrepancy between the training and inference stages in existing diffusion models, where residual data remains in the final timestep distribution during training but pure Gaussian noise is used during inference. This causes a mismatch and unintended bias.

- To address this, the paper proposes OMS, which is a compact plug-and-play module that introduces an additional step during inference. This extra step maps the pure Gaussian noise to the data-adulterated noise assumed by the pre-trained model, harmonizing training and inference.

- Once trained, the OMS module can be shared by various pre-trained diffusion models with the same latent domain. This allows enhancing image generation without modifying the original models.

- Experiments show OMS can elevate image fidelity and diversity. It also provides control over low-frequency image aspects like brightness and color based on prompts. The method is model-agnostic and versatile.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing OMS as a simple yet effective plug-and-play module to enhance diffusion sampling by reconciling the discrepancy between training and inference stages. This harmonization rectifies generation flaws without altering pre-trained models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Diffusion models - The paper focuses on improving diffusion models for text-to-image generation. This includes models like Stable Diffusion and Latent Diffusion Models (LDM).

- Noise schedules - The paper examines issues with noise schedules used during training and inference in diffusion models, and how they can lead to suboptimal image generation. This includes concepts like signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

- Zero terminal SNR - The paper discusses moving to a zero terminal SNR schedule to better destroy low-frequency information in latents during training.

- Offset noise - Adding an offset to the noise during sampling to better control aspects like image brightness.

- One More Step (OMS) - The proposed method to add an additional inference step to map pure Gaussian noise to assumed training noise before feeding into a pre-trained diffusion model.

- Low-frequency controls - The paper aims to enhance control over low-frequency attributes of generated images like brightness, through modifications during the initial inference steps.

- Classifier Guidance - Using classifier networks to better guide the image generation process based on text prompts. The proposed OMS module also supports classifier guidance.

So in summary, key terms revolve around diffusion models, noise schedules, low-frequency image attributes, the proposed OMS module, and classifier guidance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key insight behind proposing the One More Step (OMS) module? How does it help bridge the gap between training and inference in diffusion models?

2. How does the OMS module compensate for the inability of common diffusion models to generate very dark or bright images? Explain the working mechanism.  

3. The paper shows the OMS module can be shared across multiple diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and Latent Diffusion Model. What makes this transferability possible?

4. Explain the geometric intuition behind modeling the terminal noise distribution as a high-dimensional Gaussian. How does the OMS module adjust the radius?

5. What are the advantages of using velocity prediction in the OMS module over epsilon prediction? Why is it more suitable for handling near-zero SNR?

6. How does modifying the text prompt in the OMS module lead to controlled changes in brightness and color in the final generated images? Explain with examples.

7. What are the limitations of using an inconsistent text prompt between the OMS module and main diffusion model? When can it lead to unrealistic outputs? 

8. Why can't the OMS module trained on one VAE latent space be directly transferred to a diffusion model with a different VAE encoder? Explain with an example case.

9. What are the practical challenges in incorporating the OMS module inside the diffusion model pipeline itself? When would distillation be needed?

10. The paper shows the OMS module scale does not impact output quality much. Why? What does this indicate about the nature of corrections done by the OMS?
