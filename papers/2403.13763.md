# [Practical End-to-End Optical Music Recognition for Pianoform Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optical music recognition (OMR) has seen great progress recently using end-to-end deep learning models. However, most progress has been on monophonic or homophonic scores, while piano scores remain a challenge. 
- Piano scores have multiple independent voices that are difficult to linearize for sequence models. Most OMR systems use custom linearized formats instead of structured formats like MusicXML. This makes it hard to compare systems.
- Evaluation is also difficult. Metrics like symbol error rate depend on the encoding and don't correlate well with human assessment of recognition quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Linearized MusicXML (LMX) - a sequential format derived from MusicXML that retains compatibility with it. LMX linearizes the MusicXML tree structure using depth-first traversal.
- Implement direct conversion between LMX and MusicXML. This allows end-to-end training with MusicXML data.
- Create the OLiMPiC dataset based on the OpenScore Lieder corpus piano scores. It has over 17,000 synthesis samples and 1,500 test samples from IMSLP scans.
- Use Tree Edit Distance (TEDn) to compare MusicXML ground truth with recognition output directly. TEDn correlates better with human assessment.

Main Contributions:
- LMX format and MusicXML converters to enable end-to-end OMR with MusicXML data
- OLiMPiC dataset with synthetic and real-world scanned piano images along with MusicXML ground truth  
- TEDn evaluation method to compare MusicXML files directly
- Achieve state-of-the-art results on piano scores, with less than 20% TEDn error on real-world test images

The proposed infrastructure brings end-to-end OMR systems much closer to practical usefulness by supporting MusicXML natively. The OLiMPiC dataset and TEDn evaluation provide a more realistic assessment of real-world piano score recognition performance.
