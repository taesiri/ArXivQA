# [GMTalker: Gaussian Mixture based Emotional talking video Portraits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07669)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-fidelity and emotionally-controllable talking video portraits with audio-lip sync, vivid expressions, realistic head motions, and eye blinks is challenging. 
- Existing methods struggle to achieve precise emotion control, continuously interpolate between emotions, generate diverse motions, and synthesize personalized speaking styles.

Proposed Method - GMTalker
- Includes a Gaussian Mixture based Expression Generator (GMEG) to model a continuous and disentangled emotion space for better interpolation and more precise control.  
- Uses a normalizing flow based motion generator pretrained on a dataset with wide-range motions to produce diverse head motions and alleviate the "mean motion" issue.
- Introduces an Emotion Mapping Network (EMN) and integrates it with a style-based generator to control personalized emotion-related details and facial expressions.

Key Contributions:
- GMEG models emotions using a Gaussian mixture distribution for continuous emotion control and disentangled interpolation between emotions.
- The normalizing flow based motion generator leverages pretrained priors for generating diverse and natural head movements.  
- The emotion-guided generator with EMN synthesizes personalized and high-fidelity emotional portraits.
- Experiments show GMTalker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality, realism, emotion accuracy, motion diversity, and personalization.

In summary, GMTalker advances emotional talking video portrait generation through novel disentangled emotion modeling, diverse motion synthesis, and personalized emotional stylization. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate its effectiveness over previous approaches.
