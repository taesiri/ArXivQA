## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The quadratic complexity ($O(n^2)$) of the attention mechanism in transformer models for large language models (LLMs) creates a computational bottleneck. This impedes the scalability of LLMs for longer sequences and larger model capacities. Sparse attention mechanisms have emerged to mitigate this issue by approximating the full attention computation, aiming to attain computational savings without compromising model performance. However, the theoretical underpinnings explaining the efficacy and trade-offs of sparse attention remain less understood. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis delineating the inherent sparsity characteristics of attention computation within the framework of Gaussian input distributions. By establishing foundational assumptions and employing a methodical proof approach, the authors derive an upper bound on the error incurred by approximating attention via sparse computation. 

Key Results:
- Theorem 1 formally states that with high probability (≥0.9999), the attention vector for each sequence position is (ε,k)-sparse, given appropriate settings of sparsity k and error tolerance ε. This result confirms the intrinsic sparse nature of attention.

- Theorem 2 proves an upper bound on the error between the approximated sparse attention output versus the original full attention output, crucially depending on the sparsity k. 

- An efficient attention algorithm is presented, simplifying prior art by eliminating redundant computations afforded by the theoretical sparsity guarantees. Its error bound is clearly analyzed, improving upon prior results.

- The theory indicates that layers with larger attention weight norms should be prioritized for sparse approximation, guiding practical implementations.

Main Contributions:  
- Provides first theoretical examination firmly establishing the inherent sparsity in transformer attention, enabled by Gaussian input assumptions.

- Offers upper bound on approximation error that depends on tunable sparsity, illuminating the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.  

- Proposes simplified sparse attention algorithm with clearly quantified error that improves upon prior methods.

- Insights relating weight norms to attention sparsity indicate which layers most merit efficient sparse approximation.

The rigorous theoretical framework advances the fundamental comprehension of sparse mechanisms for transformer attention optimization, guiding both practical implementations and follow-up analyses.
