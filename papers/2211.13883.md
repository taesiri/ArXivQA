# [Learning with Silver Standard Data for Zero-shot Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent works have converted the relation extraction (RE) task to other NLP tasks like textual entailment and summarization. This allows using off-the-shelf models of these tasks to directly predict relations without requiring large labeled RE data. However, the resulting silver standard RE data produced as a byproduct is not utilized. Learning with noisy silver labels is challenging. There is a need to effectively leverage this silver data when pretrained models exist.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes to first detect clean samples from the silver RE data using confidence scores. A class-aware detection module is used to ensure clean samples from all classes. The selected clean silver data is used to finetune the pretrained textual entailment model. This finetuned model has improved RE performance and can be used to annotate more unlabeled data. Additional silver data, even if from a different distribution than the test data, can further improve performance.

Key Contributions:
- Propose to select clean subsets from silver RE data to finetune pretrained models for improved zero-shot RE performance
- Develop a class-aware clean data detection module to cover all relation classes
- Show that extra silver data from different distributions can further improve model performance 
- Outperform state-of-the-art on two RE datasets by large margins. Effective utilization of silver RE data in zero-shot settings.

In summary, the paper provides an effective technique to leverage silver standard relation data to significantly improve zero-shot RE performance by finetuning pretrained models. The class-aware selection and use of extra silver data are key aspects of the solution.
