# [Exploring Prompt Engineering Practices in the Enterprise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt engineering is critical for interacting with large language models (LLMs), but designing effective prompts is challenging, requiring significant iteration and skill. 
- Little is known about how practitioners actually engineer prompts over time to understand and control LLM behavior.

Methods:
- Collected and analyzed a dataset of 1,712 users' prompt editing sessions from an enterprise LLM prompting platform over 1 month.
- Sampled 57 sessions for qualitative analysis, capturing the prompt component edited (e.g. instructions, context), type of edit (e.g. add, modify), and whether edits were undone/redone.

Key Findings:
- Sessions were iterative - most edits were small modifications vs completely new prompts. 
- Most edited components were context then instructions. Surprisingly labels were also commonly edited.  
- Most common types of edits were modifications and additions. 22% of edits modified multiple components simultaneously.
- 11% of edits were rollbacks, especially for less frequently edited components like handle unknowns.
- Implications include needs for better tracking prompt versions and corresponding outputs, managing context, and structuring prompts.

In summary, through a data-driven analysis of enterprise users' prompt engineering practices, the authors gain critical insights into how practitioners understand LLMs and try to control their behavior via iterative prompt editing. Key findings highlight opportunities for better supporting prompt debugging, testing, structure, and context management.
