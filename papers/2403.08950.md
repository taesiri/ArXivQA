# [Exploring Prompt Engineering Practices in the Enterprise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt engineering is critical for interacting with large language models (LLMs), but designing effective prompts is challenging, requiring significant iteration and skill. 
- Little is known about how practitioners actually engineer prompts over time to understand and control LLM behavior.

Methods:
- Collected and analyzed a dataset of 1,712 users' prompt editing sessions from an enterprise LLM prompting platform over 1 month.
- Sampled 57 sessions for qualitative analysis, capturing the prompt component edited (e.g. instructions, context), type of edit (e.g. add, modify), and whether edits were undone/redone.

Key Findings:
- Sessions were iterative - most edits were small modifications vs completely new prompts. 
- Most edited components were context then instructions. Surprisingly labels were also commonly edited.  
- Most common types of edits were modifications and additions. 22% of edits modified multiple components simultaneously.
- 11% of edits were rollbacks, especially for less frequently edited components like handle unknowns.
- Implications include needs for better tracking prompt versions and corresponding outputs, managing context, and structuring prompts.

In summary, through a data-driven analysis of enterprise users' prompt engineering practices, the authors gain critical insights into how practitioners understand LLMs and try to control their behavior via iterative prompt editing. Key findings highlight opportunities for better supporting prompt debugging, testing, structure, and context management.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper analyzes prompt engineering practices in an enterprise context through a qualitative study of 57 users' prompt editing sessions spanning a variety of use cases, finding that users most commonly made small modifications to task instructions and context while regularly changing models, and proposes design implications for debugging prompt iterations and structuring prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a large-scale analysis of prompt editing practices across varying use cases in an enterprise context. Specifically, the authors:

- Collected and analyzed a dataset of over 1,500 prompt edits from 57 prompting sessions by enterprise users working on a variety of tasks.

- Developed a codebook to categorize the parts of prompts that were edited (e.g. instructions, context, labels) as well as the types of edits made (e.g. modifications, additions, removals).  

- Found that users focused primarily on editing task instructions and context, with context edits actually outnumbering instruction edits. Modifications were the most common type of edit.

- Identified several potentially inefficient prompting practices like undoing/redoing edits, making multiple simultaneous edits, and frequently changing context. 

- Discussed design implications and future research directions based on these observed practices, such as better tracking prompt versions, supporting prompt structure, and tools to reduce cognitive load.

In summary, the paper makes a key contribution in analyzing real-world prompt engineering behaviors in an enterprise setting across a range of use cases, in order to better understand user practices and identify opportunities to improve prompting tools and workflows.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper analyzes prompt editing sessions to understand prompting practices. What are some limitations or biases that could be introduced by only analyzing sessions where active prompting was occurring? For example, are there differences in practices between early stage prompting versus later refinement?

2. The inter-rater agreement level reported in the paper is 70\%. What are some ways the authors could further refine their coding scheme to improve agreement levels? What other validation approaches could strengthen confidence in the reported results?  

3. The paper reports on the frequency of different prompt components being edited, but does not deeply analyze the content of those edits. What further qualitative analysis could be done to better understand the specific changes being made to key components like instructions and context? 

4. The authors hypothesize about reasons for various observed prompting behaviors, like changes in context and rolling back edits. What further studies could be designed to directly test those hypotheses about the motivations and thought processes of prompt engineers?

5. The paper analyzes editing practices across a variety of use cases. Are there any differences in practices across use cases that may merit deeper investigation? For example, do code generation prompts get structured differently than summarization prompts?

6. The reported analysis aggregates across users. What user-level factors, like expertise level or organizational role, may impact prompting practices? How could the study design be extended to capture and analyze those factors?

7. The paper discusses design implications for better supporting prompt engineering. What specific interface or workflow innovations seem most promising based on the reported findings? How could those innovations be implemented and empirically tested?

8. What other data streams, like user surveys or interviews, could complement the logged interaction data analyzed here? What additional insights could that provide into prompting challenges, thought processes, and needs? 

9. The reported study was conducted within an enterprise environment. How might prompting practices differ in other settings, like academia or hobbyist user groups? What comparative studies could shed light on those differences?

10. The paper analyzes iterative editing of singular prompts. How do editing practices change during later stage prompting tasks like robustness testing, benchmarking, and pipeline integration? What longitudinal studies could provide insights into those longer-term processes?
