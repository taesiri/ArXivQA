# [A Two-Phase Recall-and-Select Framework for Fast Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the proliferation of deep learning models being trained and shared in public repositories, selecting the most suitable pre-trained model as a starting point for a new machine learning task is crucial, especially when training data is limited. However, as the number of available models continues to grow, this model selection process is becoming increasingly time-consuming. Existing methods using lightweight proxy tasks or successive halving during fine-tuning have limitations in efficiency and accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a two-phase model selection framework to enhance efficiency:

1) Coarse-Recall Phase: 
- Clusters models offline based on training performance on benchmark datasets. Models in a cluster tend to have similar performance.
- For a new task, efficiently computes a proxy score between a model cluster and the task dataset to recall a small promising candidate set. Avoids scoring all models.  

2) Fine-Selection Phase:
- Fine-tunes recalled models on the target dataset using successive halving to filter lower performing ones.
- Further accelerates filtering by mining a model's convergence trend on benchmarks to predict final target performance early. Filters more models earlier.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the two-phase selection framework that combines the advantages of using lightweight proxy tasks and fine-tuning with successive halving.

- Develops offline model clustering and convergence trend mining from benchmarks to avoid repeated computation and enable more accurate early filtering.

- Demonstrates 3x speedup over successive halving and 5x over brute force methods in experiments while identifying optimal models. Framework is robust and scales well.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient two-phase model selection approach enhanced using offline clustering and convergence trend mining that facilitates accurate and rapid selection from expanding model repositories.
