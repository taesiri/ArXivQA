# [PPIDSG: A Privacy-Preserving Image Distribution Sharing Scheme with GAN   in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Recent works have shown that federated learning still poses privacy risks like reconstruction attacks and inference attacks despite not sharing private data directly. 
- Sharing trained classification model parameters with the central server is identified as the main source of privacy leakage.
- Defenses like encryption, differential privacy, etc have limitations - they either increase overhead or compromise efficiency and model accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- A new privacy-preserving framework called PPIDSG is proposed that consists of:
  1) Block scrambling-based image encryption
  2) Image distribution sharing with GAN
  3) Local classification model training
- Images are encrypted locally using blocking and transformations controlled by random keys.
- A GAN captures the distribution of the encrypted target images. Only generator parameters are shared instead of the classifier.
- An autoencoder based feature extractor is used to extract useful features.
- The classifier is trained locally on the features from the extractor. Its loss guides the generator training.

Main Contributions:
- Enhanced membership inference attack is presented that uses multiple shadow models.
- Sharing trained classification parameters is identified as the core privacy issue in federated learning through analysis and experiments.  
- A new framework is proposed that combines GAN and feature extractor for privacy-preserving image classification without sharing classifier.
- Extensive experiments validate that the proposed PPIDSG framework defends against different attacks without compromising accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a privacy-preserving image distribution sharing scheme (PPIDSG) for federated learning that uses a block scrambling-based encryption algorithm, a GAN-based image distribution sharing method, and local classification training to defend against various inference attacks while maintaining model utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting an enhanced membership inference attack in federated learning by reconstructing classifiers of a victim and others through uploaded model parameters.

2. Through theoretical analyses and experiments, validating that sharing trained classification model parameters leads to privacy leakage in federated learning. 

3. To the best of their knowledge, proposing for the first time a framework combining a GAN and a feature extractor without uploading a trained classifier, achieving a balance between privacy-preserving and model utility in federated learning.

4. Through extensive experiments on four datasets, comparing their scheme with other defenses and showing that their approach provides a considerably more secure guarantee without compromising accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework called PPIDSG that can defend against various attacks while maintaining high model utility, through techniques like a block scrambling-based encryption algorithm, an image distribution sharing method with GAN, and local classification training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Federated learning - Enables collaborative model training on decentralized data while keeping data private. However, still risks exposing private data to adversaries.

- Label inference attack - Inferring private labels or attributes of the training data by analyzing model updates from users. 

- Membership inference attack - Determining if a specific data record was used to train the model.

- Image reconstruction attack - Reconstructing original images used for training based on model updates.  

- Block scrambling-based encryption - Transforming original images to encrypted target domain images using techniques like rotation, flipping, pixel adjustment to prevent reconstruction.

- Image distribution sharing - Using a GAN to capture distribution of target encrypted images and sharing generator parameters instead of trained classifier parameters. Helps avoid leakage from classifier sharing.

- Local classification training - Training a feature extractor and classifier locally and avoiding uploading the trained classifier to the server.

So in summary, key ideas involve investigating attacks from sharing trained classifiers in federated learning and proposing a framework involving encryption, GAN-based distribution sharing and local training to help preserve privacy.
