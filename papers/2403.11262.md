# [Understanding Diffusion Models by Feynman's Path Integral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models have shown impressive image generation capabilities, but it is not well understood why stochastic sampling schemes tend to outperform deterministic ones (e.g. probability flow ODEs) on metrics like FID. 

- There is no direct way to evaluate the negative log-likelihood (NLL) for stochastic diffusion models, making it hard to quantitatively analyze performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Reformulate diffusion models using Feynman's path integral framework from quantum physics. This provides a unified perspective on different sampling schemes.

- Introduce a parameter η that interpolates between stochastic sampling (η=1) and deterministic sampling (η=0). This is analogous to Planck's constant η in quantum mechanics.

- Apply the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) expansion technique from physics to evaluate the NLL perturbatively in powers of η. This allows assessing performance of different η.

Main Contributions:
- First path integral reformulation of diffusion models, allowing re-derivations of reverse-time SDE and loss functions.

- Introduction of the interpolation parameter η with analogy to quantum mechanics. This gives a way to continuously connect stochastic and deterministic sampling.

- Application of the WKB expansion to obtain explicit NLL calculations to first order in η. This enables quantitative analysis of the effect of noise on sampling quality.

- Experiments on synthetic data to validate the NLL computation and show improved sample quality for small non-zero η.

In summary, the paper provides a new perspective on diffusion models through physics concepts and tools to better understand the role of noise. The WKB expansion gives a way to actually evaluate likelihoods for the stochastic case.
