# [Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Rendering clean and sharp novel view images from blurry input views is challenging. While recent neural radiance fields (NeRF) based methods can reconstruct scenes from blurry images, they rely on slow volumetric rendering. 
- 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) allows real-time rendering using rasterization but fails to handle blurry input views.
- Existing deblurring methods for NeRF are not easily applicable to the rasterization-based 3D-GS.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose the first defocus deblurring framework, Deblurring 3D-GS, for real-time rendering by manipulating the covariance matrix of each 3D Gaussian to model spatially-varying blur.  
- Use a small MLP to predict per-Gaussian offsets to the rotation and scaling factors. These are used to transform the 3D Gaussians during training to simulate blur.
- For inference, the original 3D Gaussians are used directly without the MLP, enabling real-time rendering of sharp images.

- To handle sparse point clouds from blurry images, propose techniques to add additional points and use depth-based pruning of 3D Gaussians.

Contributions:
- First real-time capable defocus deblurring method for 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Manipulate covariance of Gaussians using MLP to model blur while allowing real-time rendering
- Compensate for sparse point clouds from blurry images via point addition and depth based pruning
- Achieve state-of-the-art image quality or on par with leading methods while attaining >200 FPS rendering speed 

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to enable real-time rendering of sharp images from blurry views using 3D Gaussian Splatting by transforming the Gaussians to model blur during training while using the original Gaussians directly for efficient inference.
