# [Controllable Decontextualization of Yes/No Question and Answers into   Factual Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of leveraging the knowledge in polar (yes/no) question-answer pairs (PQAs). Answers to polar questions are highly contextualized and personalized, making it difficult to use them to answer similar or other types of questions. 

- The paper proposes the task of "controllable rewriting" of answers to polar questions into decontextualized and succinct factual statements. This allows unlocking the knowledge in PQA data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model with two main components for controllable rewriting:
   1) Automated constraint extraction from PQA parse trees to extract phrases that must be present in the output statement.
   2) Injection of "soft mention flags" into the decoder to explicitly signal constraint satisfaction.

- Constraint extraction identifies noun, verb, prepositional and other phrases from parse trees that capture key information.

- Soft mention flags initialize encoder tokens that are part of extracted constraints as "not satisfied". During decoding, once semantic similarity between an extracted constraint and the decoded text meets a threshold, the flags are changed to "satisfied" to explicitly signal the model.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the novel task of controllable PQA rewriting into factual statements
- Extraction of syntactic/semantic constraints from PQAs 
- Proposal of soft mention flags to enable controllable decoding 
- New dataset of 1500 PQA-> statement pairs from Amazon data
- Empirical evaluation showing proposed approach outperforms competitors

The model achieves decontextualized and succinct rewriting while ensuring semantic equivalence. Evaluations using automated metrics and human annotations demonstrate effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new task of rewriting yes/no questions and their answers into succinct factual statements using a controllable sequence-to-sequence approach with soft constraints extracted automatically from the input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel task of rewriting polar (yes/no) questions and answers into succinct factual statements. This allows unlocking the knowledge in contextualized QA pairs to make them more reusable for other applications.

2) Introducing a controllable rewriting approach using automatically extracted constraints from the input PQA. The constraints are encoded into a soft mention flag matrix to guide the decoder to generate outputs that satisfy those constraints.

3) Creating a new dataset of 1500 PQA instances and their rewritten factual statements for training and evaluating models on this proposed rewriting task. The data covers 11 domains from Amazon's product QA pairs.

In summary, the key innovations are in defining a new challenging generative QA rewriting task, collecting matching data, and developing a constrained sequence-to-sequence approach that can reliably transform contextualized PQAs into standalone factual statements. The proposed ideas are evaluated through both automatic metrics and human judgments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Polar questions - The paper focuses on yes/no or polar questions as the main question type of interest. 

- Question-answer pairs (PQA) - Specifically looking at polar questions and their answers as the input data.

- Decontextualization - A key goal is to rewrite the contextualized answers into decontextualized factual statements.  

- Controllable rewriting - Proposing an approach for controllable sequence-to-sequence rewriting of the PQA input.

- Soft mention flags - A key component of the proposed rewriting approach, using soft constraints encoded in mention flags. 

- Automated constraint extraction - Extracting constraints automatically from the input PQA based on constituency parses.

- Factual statements - The target output is succinct factual statements framed in a second-person narrative style.

- Syntactic rewriting categories - The paper defines syntactic categories like explanation, complement, condition, and alternative for rewriting.

- New PQAR dataset - A new dataset of 1500 PQA instances and target factual statements.

In summary, the key focus is on controllable and automatic rewriting of contextual PQA data into decontextualized factual statements, enabled through soft constraints and constituency parse based extraction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a soft mention flags (SMF) mechanism for controllable rewriting. Can you explain in more detail how SMF allows for controllable generation compared to prior lexical constraint approaches? 

2. The paper extracts constraints automatically from constituency parse trees. What are the main constituency phrases targeted and why were they chosen as the constraints for this task?

3. Semantic constraint satisfaction is assessed through sliding windows over decoded outputs using semantic textual similarity. What are the limitations of this approach and can you propose any methods to improve the semantic matching?  

4. The paper argues that constrained beam search limits hypotheses and harms text quality. Can you elaborate why this occurs and propose methods to mitigate this issue?

5. Style constraints are encoded to transform first person to second person narratives. Can you explain this process and discuss any difficulties encountered when changing narrative perspective? 

6. Could the proposed method work for question types beyond yes/no questions? What modifications would be needed?

7. The constraint extraction algorithm seems to miss some key clauses, especially conditional and alternative clauses. How could the algorithm be improved to have better coverage?

8. What other possible constraints beyond those extracted could help improve the controllability of the generated statements?

9. The method is evaluated on in-domain and out-of-domain PQA datasets. What further evaluations could be done to better understand model performance?

10. The paper focuses on positional similarity for matching, but what about model output meaning? How could semantic equivalence be better evaluated?
