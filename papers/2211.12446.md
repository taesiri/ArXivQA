# [EDICT: Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12446)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an improved method for inverting denoising diffusion models on real images to enable high-fidelity image editing with text prompts?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The existing method (DDIM inversion) is unstable for real images because it relies on local linearization assumptions that propagate errors, leading to distorted reconstructions.

2) By drawing inspiration from coupling layers in normalizing flows, a new inversion method (EDICT) can be devised that enables mathematically exact inversion without relying on these assumptions. 

3) EDICT will allow for significantly more accurate inversion and reconstruction of real images compared to DDIM.

4) Using EDICT, a wider range of high-fidelity image edits guided by text prompts will be possible on real images, including local/global edits and stylization while preserving original image structure.

So in summary, the central research question is how to improve inversion of diffusion models to enable better text-guided editing of real images. The key hypothesis is that a new approach called EDICT can achieve this.
