# [Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations through Dynamics Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard imitation learning assumes demonstrations come from an optimal policy, but real-world human demonstrations often contain suboptimal and noisy behavior.  
- Collecting large-scale, high-quality human demonstrations is costly. 
- Existing methods for learning from imperfect demonstrations rely on ground truth rewards or active human supervision to evaluate demonstration quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a dynamics-based method to evaluate demonstration quality without needing additional supervision.  
- Calculate an "approach angle" between the target and the state transition to determine if the demonstration is moving towards the target. Transitions with angle below a noise threshold are considered useful. 
- Assign a confidence score to each demonstration transition using a confidence function based on the approach angle and noise angle.
- Develop a Confidence-based Inverse soft-Q Learning (CIQL) algorithm that incorporates the confidence scores. Has two variants:
    - CIQL-E: Estimates expert's optimal policy distribution 
    - CIQL-A: Estimates agent's non-optimal policy distribution

Main Contributions:
- Dynamics-based method to evaluate demonstration confidence scores without ground truth rewards or human input.
- General confidence-based imitation learning framework (CIQL) that can employ different policy matching methods.
- Evaluate CIQL experimentally and show proposed confidence score method improves success rate over baseline by 40.3% and outperforms simple noise filtering by 13.5%.
- Find CIQL-A aligns better with human intent compared to CIQL-E.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel dynamics-based confidence score evaluation approach to effectively leverage imperfect human demonstrations. Integrating this method into a generalized confidence-based inverse RL algorithm (CIQL) significantly improves task performance without needing additional supervision.
