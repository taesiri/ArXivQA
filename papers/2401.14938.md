# [DAM: Diffusion Activation Maximization for 3D Global Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainability of deep learning models for point clouds is still an understudied area, despite the increasing use of point cloud models in critical applications like autonomous vehicles and healthcare where reliability is paramount. Existing explainability methods mainly focus on tabular data, images and text, and are not directly transferable to point clouds due to their unordered nature and different model architectures. There is a need for tailored explainability methods for point clouds to understand and improve model reliability.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new global explainability method called Diffusion Activation Maximization (DAM) that generates high-quality and perceptible point cloud examples to explain entire model behaviors for different categories. DAM leverages recent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and a novel Point Diffusion Transformer (PDT) architecture to guide the optimization process for Activation Maximization. It also proposes using a second noised classifier along with the classifier being explained to provide better gradients when inputs are very noisy. 

The paper also adapts the path integrated gradients method to point cloud diffusion models as Integrated Gradients for Diffusion (IGD). This provides global saliency maps and shows how attributions change during the diffusion process for generating explanations.

Main Contributions:

- First work to use DDPM models for generating global explanations of point cloud models, with higher quality and faster explanations than prior methods

- Proposes PDT, a novel symmetric point cloud model for diffusion, eliminating inter-point correlations for cleaner gradients  

- Introduces IGD to illustrate global point-wise feature attributions and their variations when generating explanations via diffusion

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art quantitative results on ModelNet40 and ShapeNet datasets compared to previous point cloud explanation techniques


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel method called Diffusion Activation Maximization (DAM) to generate high-quality and diverse global explanations for point cloud models using denoising diffusion probabilistic models and dual-classifier guidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel global explanation generating method for point clouds based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). This is the first work incorporating DDPM models for generating global explanations of point cloud data. The method outperforms existing approaches in terms of performance and speed.

2. Proposing a diffusion path-based attribution approach called Integrated Gradients for Diffusion (IGD). This adapts the path integration method to the diffusion process, provides global saliency maps for point cloud categories, and demonstrates how attributions vary during the explanation generation process. This makes the explanations more intuitive and interpretable.

In summary, the key contributions are a new DDPM-based method for generating high-quality global explanations of point cloud models, and an adapted path attribution method that gives more intuitive global saliency maps along with the diffusion process.
