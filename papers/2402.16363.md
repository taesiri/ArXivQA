# [LLM Inference Unveiled: Survey and Roofline Model Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). The authors highlight that while LLMs have achieved remarkable capabilities, their enormous size and computational demands pose significant efficiency and accessibility challenges. 

To address this problem, the paper introduces an innovative perspective beyond traditional literature reviews. Firstly, the authors develop a practical roofline model to identify bottlenecks when deploying LLMs on real hardware devices. This model considers computation capacity, memory size, and memory bandwidth to pinpoint if layers are compute-bound or memory-bound. An open-source LLM-Viewer tool is provided to automate this analysis.  

Furthermore, the survey categorizes strategies to improve LLM efficiency into four key areas:

1) Model Compression techniques like quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation to reduce the size of parameters. The roofline model is used to analyze the impact on computation, memory and memory access.

2) Algorithmic methods for faster decoding, using techniques like early exiting to minimize parameters used per token, and speculative decoding to maximize tokens decoded per model propagation.

3) System-level optimizations (to be updated in the next version).

4) Hardware-level optimizations (to be updated in the next version).

The paper stands out by not just summarizing the state-of-the-art, but also by providing practical insights and tools to analyze bottlenecks. This allows researchers to make informed decisions when deploying LLMs. The integration of the roofline model analysis and emphasis on real-world efficiency makes this survey an indispensable resource for both new and experienced researchers working on efficient LLM inference.
