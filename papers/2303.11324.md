# [Open-vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with Embedding Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11324)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to develop an effective and generalizable framework for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation that can segment and recognize both known and novel objects?The key points are:- Traditional closed-vocabulary segmentation methods cannot handle novel objects not in the training classes. - Existing open-vocabulary attempts either sacrifice performance on the training classes or require massive extra data.- This paper proposes OPSNet, an open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation framework that is omnipotent (works well on both training and novel classes) and data-efficient (does not need huge amounts of extra data).- The key contributions are the Embedding Modulation module and several other meticulous components that enable information exchange between the segmentation model and CLIP encoder for enhanced embeddings and recognition. - Extensive experiments show OPSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO and generalizes well to other datasets with much fewer data requirements compared to prior arts.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed OPSNet framework can achieve omnipotent and data-efficient open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation through careful co-design of components like Embedding Modulation. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis.
