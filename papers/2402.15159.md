# [Machine Unlearning of Pre-trained Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets raise ethical concerns when the data includes sensitive, private, or copyrighted material. For example, a recent lawsuit by the New York Times against OpenAI alleges the use of their copyrighted articles in training models like ChatGPT.

- "Machine unlearning" has emerged as a solution to selectively remove specific data from a model's training to address these issues. However, current research on unlearning LLMs focuses only on the fine-tuning phase rather than the more critical pre-training phase. 

- Challenges in pre-trained LLM unlearning include: (1) adapting unlearning methods from other fields, (2) lack of public pre-training data availability, (3) no directly comparable retraining baselines due to the extreme costs.

Proposed Solution:
- They propose a unified formulation to consolidate prior unlearning methods into a single objective function for LLMs.

- Seven diverse unlearning methods are adapted for pre-trained LLMs: gradient ascent, fine-tuning with random labels, unlearning with adversarial samples, gradient ascent + gradient descent on retained data, and others.

- Approximate retraining is introduced as an evaluation technique, using an unseen in-distribution dataset to estimate retraining performance. This bypasses the impracticality of actually retraining LLMs.

- Experiments unlearn thousands of lengthy text chunks across three domains (arXiv papers, GitHub code, books). Performance is benchmarked on the forget sets, retain sets, and downstream tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive framework and analysis of machine unlearning methodologies tailored for pre-trained LLMs

- Introduction of approximate retraining to evaluate unlearning quality

- Experimental demonstration of unlearning efficacy across diverse domains, with seven methods being 10^5 times more efficient than retraining

- Analysis showing gradient ascent + descent on in-distribution data improves hyperparameter robustness 

- Detailed guidelines for efficient hyperparameter tuning to streamline the unlearning process

The work contributes to developing more ethical and responsible AI systems through selective forgetting in LLMs.
