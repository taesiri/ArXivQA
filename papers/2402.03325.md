# [Connect Later: Improving Fine-tuning for Robustness with Targeted   Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03325)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Models trained on labeled source domain data often generalize poorly when deployed on out-of-distribution (OOD) target domain data. In domain adaptation, where unlabeled target data is available, self-supervised pretraining (e.g. masked autoencoding, contrastive learning) can help mitigate this performance drop by aligning representations across domains. However, the paper shows that standard fine-tuning after pretraining does not consistently improve OOD error over supervised learning on labeled source data alone.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes the Connect Later framework - first pretrain on unlabeled data with generic augmentations, then fine-tune on labeled source data with targeted augmentations designed specifically for the distribution shift. The intuition is that pretraining learns useful representations within each domain, while targeted augmentations are designed to better connect the source and target domains.

Key Contributions:
- Show that standard fine-tuning after pretraining does not always improve OOD error over supervised learning baseline
- Propose Connect Later framework to better leverage pretrained representations by using targeted augmentations during fine-tuning
- Provide general methodology to construct targeted augmentations based on modeling distribution shift
- Achieve state-of-the-art results on 3 real-world datasets - wildlife species ID, tumor detection, astronomical time-series classification
- Contribute new redshift regression dataset based on astronomical time-series

The Connect Later framework demonstrates how to effectively combine the benefits of pretraining and targeted data augmentation to improve model robustness to distribution shifts. Key results show that explicitly modeling and handling the domain shift with specialized augmentations during fine-tuning is crucial to realizing gains from pretraining on new domains.
