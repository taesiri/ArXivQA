# [A Computationally Efficient Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for   Multirotors under Aerodynamic Disturbances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10323)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High-speed yet high-precision autonomous flight of multirotors requires accounting for complex aerodynamic effects like drag. However, most existing controllers neglect drag effects leading to tracking errors or infeasible trajectories.

- While model predictive control (MPC) methods can account for drag by learning a model (e.g. as a Gaussian process), the resulting optimization problem becomes nonconvex and difficult to solve in real-time. 

- Leveraging the differential flatness property of multirotors enables efficient trajectory optimization but often neglects dynamic feasibility constraints that account for limits on thrust and orientation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a computationally efficient learning-based MPC that simultaneously optimizes a feasible trajectory and adapts the control input to account for unknown aerodynamic disturbances. 

- It learns a mapping from flat states to thrust vector in world frame as a Gaussian process (GP) to model the drag forces.

- The GP is linearized (LinGP) to obtain constraints on the posterior mean and variance of the thrust vector. These constraints are tightened probabilistically and written as second-order cone (SOC) constraints.

- The constrained trajectory optimization is then solved efficiently as a SOCP while ensuring dynamic feasibility despite drag forces. The first optimal control input also adapts to the learned drag model.

Main Contributions:

- Learns a novel GP-based representation of aerodynamic drag forces by modeling the mapping from flat states to thrust vector

- Develops an MPC that leverages this model along with differential flatness to optimize feasible trajectories as a SOCP

- Demonstrates experimentally that the proposed approach outperforms MPC methods that do not account for drag, improving tracking error by 15-55% while retaining feasibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a computationally efficient learning-based model predictive control approach for multirotors that simultaneously optimizes a dynamically feasible trajectory and adapts the control input to account for unknown aerodynamic disturbances by leveraging differential flatness and modeling the disturbances as Gaussian processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Learning a novel representation of the drag forces by modeling the mapping from the multirotor flat state to the thrust vector (represented in an inertial world frame) using a Gaussian Process (GP). 

2) Developing a novel model predictive controller that leverages differential flatness and the learned GP model to optimize a feasible trajectory as a second-order cone program (SOCP). The SOCP structure allows the convex optimization problem to be solved efficiently in real-time. 

3) Demonstrating in simulation that the proposed approach outperforms related MPC methods by reducing trajectory tracking errors by up to 55% while ensuring dynamic feasibility constraints are satisfied despite unknown aerodynamic disturbances.

In summary, the key innovation is using a GP to learn the aerodynamic forces in a way that enables the efficient optimization of dynamically feasible trajectories while simultaneously adapting the control inputs to reject disturbances. This is shown through simulations to achieve improved trajectory tracking performance for aggressive flights compared to controllers that do not consider drag feasibility constraints.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key assumption enabling the use of differential flatness is that the unknown aerodynamic disturbance force $\mathbf{F}_d(\mathbf{x})$ belongs to a certain class of functions. What analysis was done to characterize or define this class of functions? How sensitive are the results to violations of this assumption?

2. In learning the disturbance force as a Gaussian process, what analysis or experiments were done to justify modeling the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components as independent functions? How would the approach change if correlations were modeled between components? 

3. The linearized Gaussian process (LinGP) approximation is central to enabling the formulated SOCP. What analysis was performed to characterize the accuracy of this approximation and determine over what operating regions it is valid? 

4. How was the selection of kernel functions and hyperparameter optimization approach for the Gaussian processes determined? Were other options considered and how much does performance depend on these choices?

5. The chance constraints enforcing feasibility are formulated with user-defined probability parameters $p_b$ and $p_c$. What guidance or methodology exists for selecting these parameters? What is the tradeoff between conservativeness and constraint violation risk?

6. Computational complexity and solver runtime analyses are lacking in the paper. What benchmarks were performed to demonstrate real-time feasibility and how does the proposed SOCP formulation compare to related nonlinear formulations?

7. The simple drag compensation approach uses the GP mean prediction. Could the GP variance also be leveraged to trade off performance and risk similar to the chance constraints?

8. How sensitive is the trajectory optimization to inaccuracies in the mass and inertial properties? Could these also be learned online using the Gaussian process framework?

9. What theoretical guarantees exist on stability, constraint satisfaction, or performance for the overall proposed control framework?

10. The results are demonstrated in simulation for single axis and 2D trajectories. What hardware experiments are planned to validate the approach on a real platform in 3D flight? What practical issues may arise?
