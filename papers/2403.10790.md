# [QuantumLeak: Stealing Quantum Neural Networks from Cloud-based NISQ   Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quantum neural networks (QNNs) implemented as variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are valuable intellectual property hosted on cloud-based noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. They are susceptible to malicious model extraction attacks. 
- Existing classical model extraction techniques fail to effectively steal QNNs from NISQ devices due to the significant noise inherent in current quantum hardware.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes QuantumLeak, a novel QNN model extraction technique to accurately construct a local substitute QNN by querying the victim QNN multiple times.

Key Features of QuantumLeak:
- Leverages an ensemble of local substitute QNNs to improve accuracy by combining their decision-making capabilities. This enhances robustness to noisy labels from the NISQ device.
- Employs a generalized formulation of the Huber loss function to improve training robustness with noisy labels.
- Proceeds in 3 phases:
   1) Initialize substitute QNNs locally
   2) Query victim QNN on cloud-based NISQ machine using bagging to create training datasets
   3) Train substitute QNNs locally and combine predictions using decision fusion
   
Key Results:
- Experiments on IBM quantum computers demonstrate QuantumLeak achieves 4.99-7.35% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art classical model extraction techniques.
- Analysis provides insights into optimal configurations of QuantumLeak regarding substitute model architectures, ensemble committee numbers, query budgets etc.

Main Contributions:
- First work to investigate QNN model extraction attacks from NISQ computers
- Proposes QuantumLeak attack to effectively steal QNNs from NISQ devices despite hardware noise
- Demonstrates significant accuracy improvements over classical model extraction techniques
- Provides insights to guide configuration choices for improved attack success 

The paper initiates research on protecting valuable QNN intellectual property against model stealing threats, setting the stage for future work in quantum security.
