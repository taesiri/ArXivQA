# [GetMesh: A Controllable Model for High-quality Mesh Generation and   Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11990)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating and editing 3D meshes is difficult and time-consuming due to their irregular structure and varying topologies across categories. Existing generative models for meshes either produce overly smooth results without sharp details (point-based methods) or are obscure and inefficient to control (triplane-based methods). There is a need for an intuitive and efficient paradigm for controllable high-quality mesh generation and manipulation.

Method:
The paper proposes GetMesh, a generative model that combines the merits of both point-based and triplane-based representations for meshes. 

Key ideas:
1) Use a varying number of points as the latent representation to enable control over mesh topology by adjusting number/position/features of points. 
2) Re-organize the points as triplane representation by projecting features onto xy, xz, yz planes based on point positions. This allows extracting high-quality meshes with details using triplane decoder.

Two diffusion models are trained on point positions and features respectively. The triplane decoder uses DMTet and refinement to output meshes.

Contributions:
1) GetMesh generates high-quality meshes with sharp details, outperforming existing single- and multi-category models.

2) Flexible control over mesh generation:
    - Change global/local topology by adjusting number/position of points
    - Add/remove parts by varying number of points
    - Combine parts across categories by concatenating point sets

3) Applications: 
    - Animate complex shape transformations by varying point positions
    - Generate novel shapes via part combinations
    - Add materials using existing generators

In summary, GetMesh enables controllable high-quality mesh generation by unifying the benefits of point- and triplane-based representations via diffusion modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GetMesh, a controllable generative model for high-quality mesh generation and manipulation across different categories, which combines a varying number of latent points with a triplane representation to enable both flexible control and reconstruction of detailed meshes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a highly controllable generative model, called GetMesh, for mesh generation and manipulation across different categories. Specifically:

1) GetMesh combines the merits of both point-based representations and triplane-based representations. It uses a varying number of points as the latent representation for controllability, and re-organizes them as triplanes for generating high-quality meshes with rich details.

2) GetMesh enables fine-grained control over the mesh generation process that previous models cannot achieve. By adjusting the number, positions or features of the latent points, it allows intuitively changing global/local mesh topologies, adding/removing mesh parts, and combining mesh parts across categories.

3) Extensive experiments show that GetMesh generates higher quality and more diverse meshes compared to previous multi-category and even single-category mesh generative models. It also demonstrates controllable generation abilities like modifying engine numbers of an airplane or gradually morphing a car into an airplane.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing GetMesh, a controllable and high-quality generative model for mesh generation and editing across categories. It combines the advantages of point-based and triplane-based representations, and enables unprecedented level of control over the generation process.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining a point-based representation with a triplane-based representation for mesh generation. Why is this hybrid approach beneficial compared to using only one type of representation? What are the limitations?

2. The method uses a varying number of points as the latent representation. What is the intuition behind using a varying number rather than a fixed number? How does this help with controllability?

3. The paper mentions projecting the point features onto xy, xz and yz planes according to their positions to form the triplane representation. Why is it important to project based on the point positions? What would happen if the positions were not used?

4. What is the purpose of the refinement module after extracting the coarse mesh from DMTet? Why are these refinement steps necessary instead of just using the mesh from DMTet?

5. The method trains separate diffusion models for point positions and features. Why is it beneficial to model these separately instead of jointly? What are the tradeoffs?  

6. Explain the intuition behind the guided sampling method for the position diffusion model. Why is this needed in addition to directly editing the point positions?

7. The method combines shapes by concatenating their latent point representations. How does the method handle any inconsistencies or gaps that may arise when combining arbitrary shapes?

8. What modifications would be needed to scale the method to much larger and more complex shapes beyond the ShapeNet dataset? What are the limitations?

9. The method enables changing mesh topology by manipulating the latent points. Compare this approach to traditional methods of mesh animation that deform an existing topology. What are the pros and cons?

10. How suitable is the latent space for interpolating between shapes? What types of shape interpolations would not work well and why?
