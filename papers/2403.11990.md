# [GetMesh: A Controllable Model for High-quality Mesh Generation and   Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11990)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating and editing 3D meshes is difficult and time-consuming due to their irregular structure and varying topologies across categories. Existing generative models for meshes either produce overly smooth results without sharp details (point-based methods) or are obscure and inefficient to control (triplane-based methods). There is a need for an intuitive and efficient paradigm for controllable high-quality mesh generation and manipulation.

Method:
The paper proposes GetMesh, a generative model that combines the merits of both point-based and triplane-based representations for meshes. 

Key ideas:
1) Use a varying number of points as the latent representation to enable control over mesh topology by adjusting number/position/features of points. 
2) Re-organize the points as triplane representation by projecting features onto xy, xz, yz planes based on point positions. This allows extracting high-quality meshes with details using triplane decoder.

Two diffusion models are trained on point positions and features respectively. The triplane decoder uses DMTet and refinement to output meshes.

Contributions:
1) GetMesh generates high-quality meshes with sharp details, outperforming existing single- and multi-category models.

2) Flexible control over mesh generation:
    - Change global/local topology by adjusting number/position of points
    - Add/remove parts by varying number of points
    - Combine parts across categories by concatenating point sets

3) Applications: 
    - Animate complex shape transformations by varying point positions
    - Generate novel shapes via part combinations
    - Add materials using existing generators

In summary, GetMesh enables controllable high-quality mesh generation by unifying the benefits of point- and triplane-based representations via diffusion modeling.
