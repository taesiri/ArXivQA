# [SGD with Partial Hessian for Deep Neural Networks Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SGD with Partial Hessian for Deep Neural Networks Optimization":

Problem:
- Training deep neural networks (DNNs) typically relies on first-order optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which only utilize gradient information. 
- Second-order optimization methods that incorporate Hessian information can accelerate training and improve performance, but computing the full Hessian matrix is infeasible for large DNNs. 
- Existing approximations of the Hessian tend to be imprecise, leading to unstable training performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a compound optimizer called SGD with Partial Hessian (SGD-PH) that combines SGD with partial but precise Hessian information.
- It analyzes the Hessian matrix for channel-wise 1D parameters commonly used in normalization layers like batch norm. This partial Hessian matrix is proven to be diagonal, allowing precise extraction via Hessian-free methods.
- SGD-PH applies a second-order update with the precise partial Hessian to 1D parameters in normalization layers, while retaining a first-order SGD update for other parameters.

Contributions:
- Mathematical proof that the Hessian matrix for channel-wise 1D parameters in normalization layers is diagonal, allowing efficient extraction.
- Introduction of SGD-PH, a novel compound optimizer that combines first and second-order updates.
- Extensive experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrating SGD-PH's superior performance over both first and second-order optimizers.
- Analysis showing SGD-PH inherits the generalizability of first-order methods while benefiting from second-order information.
- Demonstration that SGD-PH generalizes to DNNs without normalization layers by decoupling convolutions.

In summary, the paper proposes SGD-PH, a hybrid first/second-order optimizer that extracts precise partial Hessian information to improve DNN training efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SGD-PH, a compound optimizer that combines stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) with precise partial Hessian information extracted from channel-wise 1D parameters to improve optimization of deep neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new compound optimizer called SGD with Partial Hessian (SGD-PH). Specifically:

- It combines stochastic gradient descent (first-order optimizer) with partial but precise second-order (Hessian) information to update the parameters in deep neural networks. 

- It proves that the Hessian matrices associated with channel-wise 1D parameters (e.g. in batch normalization layers) are diagonal, and extracts them precisely using a Hessian-free approach. These are then used in the Newton-update for those parameters.

- For other parameters, it uses the regular SGD update. So it inherits the advantages of both first-order and second-order methods.

- It generalizes the method to convolutional layers by decoupling them into a linear scaling part and a convolution part using weight normalization, and applies second-order update to the scaling parameters.

- Experiments on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet and ImageNet datasets demonstrate its stability, effectiveness and capability of improving optimization and generalization performance over state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimizers.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the SGD-PH optimizer that combines precise partial second-order information with SGD, and showing its effectiveness on various tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes combining first-order and second-order optimization methods by using precise second-order information for only the channel-wise parameters. Why is this a good compromise rather than using full second-order methods or only first-order methods? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks?

2) The paper shows that the Hessian matrix for the channel-wise parameters can be proven to be diagonal. Walk through the mathematical derivation of why this property holds. What assumptions does this rely on?  

3) The diagonal Hessian matrices for the channel-wise parameters are extracted using a Hessian-free approach. Explain what Hessian-free methods are and why they are preferred here over directly computing the Hessian. What are the computational and memory advantages?

4) Explain the mathematical formulation behind the weight normalization technique and how it enables decoupling of the convolutional layers into channel-wise scale factors. Why does this allow the method to be applied even without batch normalization layers?

5) Several techniques from optimization literature are used in the method, including momentum steps, weight decay, and modifications to ensure positive definiteness of the Hessian approximation. Explain the motivation behind each of these techniques when applying second-order methods to non-convex neural network training.

6) Ablation studies are shown testing the robustness of the method to choices of hyperparameters like learning rate, weight decay, Hessian momentum etc. Analyze these results - for which hyperparameters does the method seem most robust and why might this be the case?

7) The method combines first-order and second-order information to try to get the best of both worlds. Based on the experiments shown, analyze whether the method seems to be achieving this goal of matching/beating first-order methods while improving upon other second-order methods.

8) What comparisons are missing that would give further evidence about the pros/cons of this method - for example, how might the computational expense compare to full second-order methods? How might the performance scale to very large batch sizes?

9) The ultimate goal is developing optimization methods tailored to neural network training. From that lens, discuss any limitations you see in the framing or evaluation of this work. What open questions remain about the method and its applicability?

10) The paper proposes a specific structure exploiting channel-wise parameters and diagonal Hessians. Discuss how the high-level idea of combining first and second-order methods in a structured way might be extended or modified for other potential benefits. What future directions for research could this inspire?
