# [E(3)-Equivariant Mesh Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "E(3)-Equivariant Mesh Neural Networks":

Problem:
- Triangular meshes are widely used to represent 3D objects and have advantages over other representations like voxels and point clouds. Developing geometric deep learning methods that can effectively process mesh data is an important problem.
- Many existing mesh learning methods rely on invariants and thus are not very expressive. Other methods like convolutional and attention-based models tend to be more complex. There is a need for a simple yet effective equivariant architecture for mesh data.
- Graph-based methods cannot exploit the face structure in meshes. Meshes also tend to be long-range graphs which can undermine graph methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Equivariant Mesh Neural Networks (EMNN), a simple extension of E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) to adapt them to mesh data.
- It incorporates face information in EGNN message passing using the face normal vector and area as equivariant and invariant features respectively. This is done minimally through cross products.
- It also adds multiple vector channels and hierarchical feature interaction between equivariant and invariant features to improve modeling.

Main Contributions:
- A simple way to extend EGNN to mesh data by incorporating face information using normal vectors and areas.
- The resulting EMNN method is proven to be equivariant to E(3) transformations.
- Experiments show EMNN outperforms more complex state-of-the-art equivariant models like GEM-CNN and EMAN on mesh tasks.
- EMNN also shows competitive performance compared to non-equivariant mesh models while being simpler.
- Additional vector channels and hierarchy further improve performance.
- The simplicity of the model also makes it very efficient in terms of runtime and memory.
