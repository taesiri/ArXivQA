# [Generalized Lagrangian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) have shown promise for learning dynamical systems while preserving physical structure and properties. However, LNNs are limited to modeling conservative Lagrangian systems that satisfy energy conservation laws. Many real-world physical systems are non-conservative due to friction, damping, etc. 

- There is a need for neural network models that can learn non-conservative dynamical systems while retaining interpretability and better accuracy compared to baseline/unstructured models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Generalized Lagrangian Neural Networks (GLNNs) tailored for non-conservative systems by leveraging generalized Lagrange's equations.

- They provide a methodology to formulate dissipative systems into a generalized Lagrangian framework amenable for neural network modeling.

- GLNNs use neural nets to represent the Lagrangian and non-conservative forces as black boxes, while preserving the structure of generalized Lagrange's equations. This provides physical interpretability.

- Two loss functions are presented - one based on acceleration prediction error, another based on state prediction error.

Key Contributions:

- Introduced a method to transform physical non-conservative systems into generalized Lagrangian equations
- Proposed GLNN architecture that retains this Lagrangian structure for enhanced modeling
- Demonstrated GLNN's superior predictive performance over baseline model
- Presented Lagrangian formulation for compound double pendulum with friction  
- Analyzed GLNN's performance by varying neural network hyperparameters
- Showed accurate energy prediction for non-conservative systems using GLNNs

Limitations:
- GLNNs cannot guarantee diminishing energy for all dissipative systems
- Increased training complexity compared to baseline models

In summary, the paper introduces GLNNs to expand Lagrangian neural networks for non-conservative physical systems, with demonstrated improvements in predictive accuracy.
