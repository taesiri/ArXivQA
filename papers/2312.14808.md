# [A Tricycle Model to Accurately Control an Autonomous Racecar with Locked   Differential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical single-track vehicle models used for autonomous racing have limitations in distinguishing between tight and wide radius turns on road courses. This leads to inaccurate trajectory tracking.
- A locked differential causes dynamic effects like nose-in/nose-out behavior which cannot be modeled by a single-track model.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel three-wheel (tricycle) model is developed that accounts for the path curvature dependence and effects of the locked differential. 
- The model estimates the longitudinal forces at the rear axle to anticipate potential nose-out and improve tracking.
- Stability analysis is done to find a suitable discretization step time for numerical stability.
- A micro-step discretization method is used in the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to improve accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- The proposed tricycle model with locked differential contribution is new and improves lateral tracking error over single-track models.
- The model is shown to be effective in both tight and wide turns as opposed to a single-track model tuned for either type of turn. 
- With additional tools like a trajectory planner, longitudinal planner etc., the MPC with the model is able to exploit close to the tire limits in simulation.
- The method is validated experimentally on the Dallara AV-21 vehicle showing improved consistency and tracking vs. single-track models.

In summary, a novel tricycle model is proposed for autonomous racing that captures locked differential effects for improved trajectory tracking on varied road course turns. The integrated MPC control scheme is able to achieve close to limit driving in simulation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel three-wheel dynamic model to account for the effects of a locked differential on the lateral dynamics of an autonomous open-wheel racecar, demonstrating improved path tracking and consistency compared to a single-track model in simulations and preliminary on-track tests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A novel three-wheel (tricycle) model is developed to account for the effects of a locked differential on the lateral dynamics of an autonomous open-wheel racecar. This allows for better modeling and trajectory tracking compared to the classical single-track model. 

2) A stability analysis is performed on the dynamic model to determine a suitable discretization step time and micro-step discretization approach to make the model suitable for real-time model predictive control.

3) The model and control approach are validated through simulations, showing improved performance in tracking trajectories with varying curvatures compared to a single-track model, as well as the ability to operate the vehicle near its handling limits.

4) Preliminary experimental results demonstrate reduced lateral tracking error using the tricycle model compared to a single-track model in on-track tests of an autonomous racecar.

In summary, the key contribution is the development and validation of the tricycle model to better capture the effects of a locked differential on vehicle dynamics for autonomous racing applications.
