# [CoIN: A Benchmark of Continual Instruction tuNing for Multimodel Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, their ability to continually learn and adapt to new instructions remains limited. 
- Specifically, MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when sequentially fine-tuned on new instructions, losing the ability to follow previous instructions.
- Existing research has not sufficiently explored continual learning for MLLMs in the instruction tuning setting. Prior works are limited to classification tasks rather than leveraging the full generative capabilities of MLLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new benchmark called CoIN - Continual Instruction tuNing to assess MLLMs in a sequential instruction tuning paradigm across diverse tasks.
- CoIN contains 10 datasets spanning 8 vision-language task categories to ensure comprehensive evaluation. Two types of instructions are designed for each task.
- A novel evaluation methodology is proposed that considers both the model's ability to follow instructions (alignment to human intent) as well as retain general knowledge.
- Experiments show catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs is primarily due to losing alignment to human intent rather than forgetting general knowledge. 
- To mitigate forgetting, the authors propose MoELoRA which equips MLLMs with distinct experts to acquire specialized knowledge for each task.

Main Contributions:
- New CoIN benchmark to assess MLLMs in continual instruction tuning setting
- Novel evaluation considering instruction following and knowledge retention
- Analysis showing primary issue is losing human intent alignment rather than forgetting knowledge
- MoELoRA method with expert tuning to reduce catastrophic forgetting for MLLMs
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating effectiveness of benchmark and proposed approach

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions around continually training MLLMs to follow new instructions without forgetting prior capabilities. The proposed benchmark, evaluation techniques and methods open promising directions to enhance continual learning for multidmodal models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a new benchmark CoIN for evaluating multimodal large language models on continual instruction tuning across diverse vision-language tasks and finds that catastrophic forgetting stems primarily from losing alignment to human intent rather than loss of reasoning skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel benchmark, Continual Instruction tuNing (CoIN), for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in continual instruction tuning. CoIN consists of 10 datasets spanning 8 different tasks to provide a comprehensive and diverse assessment.

2. Introducing a new evaluation approach that considers model performance from two aspects: Instruction Following to assess alignment with human intent, and General Knowledge to evaluate reasoning ability. This allows a more comprehensive analysis of MLLMs. 

3. Revealing through experiments on CoIN that the main cause of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs is the loss of ability to align with human intent, rather than the loss of general knowledge.

4. Introducing MoELoRA, which brings a Mixture-of-Experts framework into MLLMs, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show this is effective in retaining instruction alignment on CoIN.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CoIN benchmark and a new analysis approach to gain insights into catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs, as well as introducing a method to mitigate this issue.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Continual learning (CL)
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) 
- Instruction tuning
- Catastrophic forgetting
- CoIN benchmark
- Instruction following 
- General knowledge
- Mixture-of-experts (MoE)
- MoELoRA

The paper proposes a new benchmark called CoIN to evaluate the capability of MLLMs to continually learn from new instructions while retaining previously learned skills. It introduces metrics to assess models on both instruction following and general knowledge retention. The analysis shows MLLMs tend to forget prior instruction alignment more than general knowledge. To mitigate this, the paper utilizes a MoE approach called MoELoRA to allow learning specialized knowledge in distinct experts. Overall, the key focus is on assessing and improving continual instruction tuning for state-of-the-art MLLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a Mixture-of-Experts approach called MoELoRA to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multimodal continual learning. How does the proposed MoELoRA architecture allow the model to retain prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks?

2. The paper evaluates performance on two axes - instruction following and general knowledge retention. Why is it important to assess both capabilities in continually learned multimodal models? How do the results for each metric provide insight?

3. The CoIN benchmark comprises tasks across 8 categories to ensure diversity. What are some key considerations when curating tasks and datasets for continual evaluation of multimodal models? How could the benchmark be expanded in future work?

4. The authors find that failure in intention alignment is a greater contributor to catastrophic forgetting than loss of knowledge. What implications does this have for continually learned multimodal models? How can this insight inform method development?

5. How does the proposed MoELoRA method conceptually compare to other continual learning techniques like regularization and replay methods? What are unique advantages or disadvantages of the approach?

6. The CoIN benchmark only considers parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA. How might performance and catastrophic forgetting manifest differently with full fine-tuning? Is this an important area of analysis?

7. The paper introduces distinct instruction templates for each task type. What motivates this design choice? How do results support or refute the hypothesized benefits of using varied templates?

8. What considerations need to be made in implementing and training continual learning methods such that they could be deployed in real-world applications? Are there open challenges to be addressed?

9. The authors use an additional language model to semantically evaluate retained knowledge. What other evaluation protocols could provide insight into concept retention and transfer in addition to exact accuracy?

10. How might task order impact model performance in continual multimodal tuning scenarios? Should expected task shifts be a factor when designing continual learning methods and real-world integrations?
