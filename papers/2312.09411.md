# [OTOv3: Automatic Architecture-Agnostic Neural Network Training and   Compression from Structured Pruning to Erasing Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) into more compact and efficient models without sacrificing much accuracy is an important problem. Existing methods like structured pruning and neural architecture search (NAS) require substantial engineering efforts and domain expertise to manually design the search space and training pipelines. The authors aim to develop a framework that can automatically compress general DNNs with minimal human effort. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose Only-Train-Once version 3 (OTOv3), which is the first framework to automatically train and compress general DNNs via both structured pruning and erasing redundant operations. Given any DNN, OTOv3 first automatically analyzes the architecture and generates a search space of removable structures based on novel dependency graph algorithms. It then jointly trains the DNN and identifies redundant structures using newly proposed optimizers - Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) for pruning and Hierarchical HSPG (H2SPG) for erasing. Finally, OTOv3 constructs a compact, high-performance sub-network.

Key Contributions:
- First framework to support automated training and compression of general DNNs via pruning and erasing operators in one-shot manner.
- Automated search space generation for pruning and erasing based on proposed dependency graph analysis. 
- DHSPG optimizer for reliable structured pruning by hybrid training of separate variable groups.
- H2SPG, the first optimizer to solve hierarchical structured sparsity problems by considering network hierarchy.
- Automated sub-network construction without any fine-tuning.

The proposed OTOv3 framework significantly reduces engineering efforts compared to prior arts, achieves state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks, and opens up new research directions in automated machine learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes OTOv3, a framework that automatically trains and compresses general deep neural networks in one shot by either structurally pruning operators to slim them or entirely erasing redundant operators to simplify the architecture, without the need for manual search space design or pipeline engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes OTOv3, a framework that can automatically train and compress a general deep neural network (DNN) to generate a compact sub-network by either structurally pruning or erasing redundant operators. 

2. It introduces automated algorithms to generate the search spaces (sets of removable structures) for pruning and erasing modes based on analyzing the DNN architecture.

3. For pruning mode, it proposes a new optimizer called Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) to solve the structured sparsity optimization problem and identify redundant structures to prune.

4. For erasing mode, it proposes a new optimizer called Hierarchical Half-Space Projected Gradient (HHSPG) to solve the hierarchical structured sparsity problem while ensuring the validity of the remaining sub-network after removing structures.

5. It provides automated algorithms to construct compact sub-networks based on the solutions from DHSPG and HHSPG for pruning and erasing modes respectively.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end framework called OTOv3 that can automatically train and compress a general DNN to generate a high-performing compact sub-network with minimal human effort. It supports both pruning and erasing operators through novel algorithms and optimizers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified framework called OTOv3 that can perform both structured pruning and erasing operators automatically. What are the key differences and challenges between these two modes of compression? How does the proposed method address them?

2. The paper claims OTOv3 is the first framework to automatically generate search spaces and train general DNNs with minimal manual effort. What graph algorithms does it use to analyze operator dependencies and construct pruning/erasing search spaces? 

3. The paper introduces two new sparse optimizers - DHSPG for pruning and HHSPG for erasing. How are they different from existing optimizers like proximal gradient methods or HSPG? What novel designs do they have to tackle structured sparsity problems?

4. HHSPG is claimed to be the first optimizer to solve hierarchical structured sparsity problems. What makes this problem more challenging compared to disjoint sparsity? How does HHSPG incorporate network hierarchy into its formulation and algorithm?

5. The pruning and erasing modes use distinct algorithms to construct the final compact sub-networks. What are the key steps and how do they leverage the solutions found by DHSPG and HHSPG?

6. What engineering improvements does OTOv3 have over its predecessor OTOv2? How does it make the overall pipeline more convenient and flexible for users? 

7. The experiments cover a diverse set of models and datasets. Analyze the results on 1-2 models in detail. How does OTOv3 compare against other state-of-the-art methods?

8. The erasing mode experiments compare HHSPG against DHSPG on RegNet. What do the results indicate about handling network hierarchy in structured sparsity problems?

9. The method has two distinct phases - search space generation and optimization. What potential ways are there to jointly optimize both components in an end-to-end manner?

10. The paper focuses on image classification and language tasks. What additional challenges might arise in applying OTOv3 to other domains like time-series forecasting or graph neural networks?
