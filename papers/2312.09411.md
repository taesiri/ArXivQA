# [OTOv3: Automatic Architecture-Agnostic Neural Network Training and   Compression from Structured Pruning to Erasing Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) into more compact and efficient models without sacrificing much accuracy is an important problem. Existing methods like structured pruning and neural architecture search (NAS) require substantial engineering efforts and domain expertise to manually design the search space and training pipelines. The authors aim to develop a framework that can automatically compress general DNNs with minimal human effort. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose Only-Train-Once version 3 (OTOv3), which is the first framework to automatically train and compress general DNNs via both structured pruning and erasing redundant operations. Given any DNN, OTOv3 first automatically analyzes the architecture and generates a search space of removable structures based on novel dependency graph algorithms. It then jointly trains the DNN and identifies redundant structures using newly proposed optimizers - Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) for pruning and Hierarchical HSPG (H2SPG) for erasing. Finally, OTOv3 constructs a compact, high-performance sub-network.

Key Contributions:
- First framework to support automated training and compression of general DNNs via pruning and erasing operators in one-shot manner.
- Automated search space generation for pruning and erasing based on proposed dependency graph analysis. 
- DHSPG optimizer for reliable structured pruning by hybrid training of separate variable groups.
- H2SPG, the first optimizer to solve hierarchical structured sparsity problems by considering network hierarchy.
- Automated sub-network construction without any fine-tuning.

The proposed OTOv3 framework significantly reduces engineering efforts compared to prior arts, achieves state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks, and opens up new research directions in automated machine learning.
