# [SSP: A Simple and Safe automatic Prompt engineering method towards   realistic image synthesis on LVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly advanced in their ability to generate realistic images from text prompts. However, previous prompt engineering methods that aim to further improve image quality tend to introduce random additional vocabulary, which can alter original semantics and introduce unsafe factors. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a Simple and Safe Prompt engineering method (SSP) that improves image quality by appending optimal camera descriptions to original prompts. This avoids altering original semantics or introducing unsafe factors.

Specifically:
- They create a dataset from multiple public datasets and use GPT-4 to filter and generate a set of 10k original text prompts. 

- They manually categorize prompts into shooting themes, and select optimal cameras for each theme by calculating FID between generated images and real images. This ensures authenticity while preserving semantics.

- They fine-tune BERT on this dataset to build a classifier that can automatically match optimal cameras to input prompts. 

- Optimized prompts are formed by appending predicted camera descriptions to original prompts. These are input to GPT-4 to generate images.

- They introduce a prompt-image alignment checking step before final image output to ensure accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Release of a new prompt optimization dataset
- Introduction of SSP, a safe prompt engineering method using optimal camera descriptions 
- Experiments show SSP improves:
  - Semantic consistency by 16% vs baselines
  - Safety metrics by 48.9%
  - User preference for image quality by over 65%

The proposed SSP method can optimize prompts to generate high-quality, realistic and safe images from LVMs without additional model training.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple and safe prompt engineering method called SSP that improves image generation quality from large vision models by automatically appending optimal camera descriptions to original prompts without altering semantics or introducing unsafe factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Releasing a new dataset for image generation prompt optimization, suitable for visual prompt optimization tasks.

2. Introducing SSP, a novel method to improve image generation quality by providing optimal camera descriptions without altering original content or introducing unsafe factors. 

3. Extensive experiments demonstrating SSP's superior performance compared to two robust baselines. SSP shows an average improvement of 16% in prompt consistency and 5% in text-image alignment over the baselines, with a 48.9% increase in safety metrics.

4. Experiments with text feature analysis proving that prompt engineering in LVM can change the data distribution of prompts, enabling better generation results. This may inspire other strategies for prompt-driven optimization on large models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the SSP method for safe and optimized prompt engineering to improve text-to-image generation quality using large vision models. The method is demonstrated to enhance consistency, alignment and safety compared to existing approaches.
