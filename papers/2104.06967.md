# [Efficiently Teaching an Effective Dense Retriever with Balanced Topic   Aware Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06967)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we develop an efficient training method for dense passage retrieval models that achieves high effectiveness without relying on large amounts of compute resources?The authors propose a new training approach called TAS-Balanced that uses topic-aware sampling and balanced margin sampling to compose more informative training batches. They show that this approach allows them to train an effective dense retriever model using just a single consumer-grade GPU, outperforming prior methods that rely on much more expensive hardware configurations. Specifically, the key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1. Topic-aware sampling of queries and balanced margin sampling of passage pairs will compose more useful training batches that provide better learning signal, especially for in-batch negative teaching.2. Combining pairwise and in-batch negative teaching provides complementary supervision that improves effectiveness over either alone. 3. The proposed TAS-Balanced training approach can achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness for dense retrieval using only modest compute resources (a single GPU).4. The dense retriever model trained with TAS-Balanced provides increased recall and accuracy that benefits larger search systems when used as a first-stage ranker.The experiments and results provide evidence supporting these hypotheses, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the TAS-Balanced training methodology for dense passage retrieval.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient topic aware sampling (TAS) and balanced margin sampling strategy for training dense passage retrieval models, called TAS-Balanced. Specifically:- They propose to compose training batches by sampling queries from the same topic cluster (TAS), which provides more informative training signals for in-batch negatives. - They also balance the passage pairs selected per query based on the margin scores from a teacher model (TAS-Balanced). This reduces high-margin, low information passage pairs.- They combine TAS-Balanced sampling with a dual teacher supervision using both pairwise and in-batch negatives. - Their approach requires only a single consumer-grade GPU and achieves state-of-the-art results on the TREC Deep Learning track benchmarks, outperforming methods that use much more computational resources for training.- They demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of their approach across different query sets and show how it can improve results in larger retrieval pipelines.In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and effective passage retrieval training technique that does not rely on large-scale compute infrastructure, making high quality dense retrieval more accessible. The TAS-Balanced sampling and dual teacher supervision are the main novel components enabling the efficiency and performance gains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient topic-aware sampling (TAS) strategy for training dense passage retrieval models. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Topic Aware Sampling (TAS): Clustering the training queries into topics and sampling queries from the same topic cluster to compose training batches. This provides more informative batches for training with in-batch negatives. - Balanced Margin Sampling: Sampling passage pairs for each query in a balanced way across the range of teacher score margins. This reduces skewed sampling of easy negatives.- Combining TAS and balanced margin sampling into an efficient batch sampling strategy called TAS-Balanced.- Using a dual teacher supervision with both a pairwise teacher (BERTcat) and an in-batch negatives teacher (ColBERT) for training.- Showing that TAS-Balanced training with dual supervision achieves state-of-the-art results on dense retrieval benchmarks while only requiring a single consumer-grade GPU. In summary, the key contribution is developing the TAS-Balanced batch sampling technique to enable efficient and effective training of dense retrievers without requiring large compute resources. The results demonstrate improved accuracy over prior training methods and robustness to different randomizations.

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary: The paper proposes an efficient topic-aware sampling and dual-teacher supervision method to train an effective dense passage retriever using only a single consumer-grade GPU, achieving state-of-the-art results on the TREC Deep Learning track's query sets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research in dense passage retrieval:- The paper focuses on efficient training of dense retrieval models (specifically BERT-based dual encoders) using only modest compute resources. Many other leading approaches require large batches and multiple GPUs/TPUs to train effectively. This work trains competitively using a single GPU.- The proposed TAS-Balanced sampling technique aims to compose more informative training batches by sampling queries from the same topic clusters and balancing passage pairs based on margin. This is a novel way to improve training efficiency without extra compute. Other work has explored dynamic passage sampling strategies during training but is more resource intensive.- For model training, the paper uses a dual-teacher approach combining pairwise and in-batch negatives to better supervise the student dense retriever. Other methods have used one or the other, but combining knowledge from both teachers is innovative.- The trained model achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness on the TREC Deep Learning track benchmarks while having low query latency comparable to BM25. This enables the method to be deployed efficiently in a production setting.- When integrated in a pipeline, the TAS-trained retriever boosts end-to-end performance by increasing candidate recall for later re-ranking. Many dense retrieval papers focus only on standalone performance. - The techniques are general and could likely improve other dual-encoder architectures besides BERT. But the goal is a simple and fast deployable model instead of maximizing quality at the expense of efficiency.In summary, this work makes advances in dense retriever training efficiency, requiring less compute than related work while achieving excellent results. The innovations in sampling, teacher combination, and pipeline integration differentiate it from other research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on training dense passage retrieval models:- This paper focuses on efficiently training an effective dense retriever using only a single consumer-grade GPU, while most other work uses much larger compute resources like multiple high-end GPUs. For example, RocketQA and ANCE use 8x V100 GPUs while this method needs only a single GTX 1080Ti.- The paper proposes a novel training approach called TAS-Balanced that combines topic-aware query sampling and balanced margin passage pair sampling. This aims to improve the informativeness of each training batch. Other recent work like RocketQA and ANCE use dynamic negative sampling which requires repeated indexing.- For supervision, this paper uses a dual teacher approach with both pairwise (BERTcat) and in-batch (ColBERT) signals. Other methods like ANCE, RocketQA, and TCT use either pairwise or in-batch superivsion. Using both teachers together is a key contribution.- Experiments show the TAS-Balanced training outperforms other methods like ANCE, RocketQA, TCT, and Margin-MSE on the dense TREC-DL benchmarks while using much less compute. It also achieves competitive results on the sparse MSMARCO dataset.- This paper provides the first dense retriever that outperforms BM25 and docT5query on recall at all cutoffs on the TREC benchmarks. It also shows improved results when used as a first-stage ranker in full search pipelines.In summary, this paper makes dense retriever training more efficient and accessible while advancing effectiveness especially on dense ranking benchmarks like TREC-DL. The focus on reduced compute sets it apart from other contemporaneous work on dense retrieval training.
