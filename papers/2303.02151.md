# Prompt, Generate, then Cache: Cascade of Foundation Models makes Strong   Few-shot Learners

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:Can cascading and collaborating multiple foundation models with different pre-training paradigms improve few-shot image classification performance? Specifically, the paper proposes CaFo, which incorporates knowledge from four foundation models:- CLIP (language-contrastive knowledge from vision-language pretraining)- DINO (vision-contrastive knowledge from self-supervised pretraining)  - DALL-E (vision-generative knowledge from vision-language pretraining)- GPT-3 (language-generative knowledge from language modeling pretraining)The key hypothesis seems to be that by cascading and collaborating these diverse models in a specific pipeline (prompt with GPT-3, generate images with DALL-E, cache predictions from CLIP and DINO), CaFo can achieve state-of-the-art performance on few-shot image classification benchmarks.The central research question that motivates the work is how to effectively leverage and combine the complementary knowledge from different foundation models to improve few-shot learning. The paper aims to demonstrate that cascading multiple models in a principled pipeline can allow each model to contribute its strengths (e.g. CLIP for language-vision alignment, DALL-E for data augmentation), leading to overall performance gains.In summary, the core research question is whether collaborating diverse self-supervised knowledge through a cascaded pipeline can advance few-shot image classification performance beyond what any individual model can achieve alone. The CaFo framework is proposed to investigate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a cascade of foundation models called CaFo that incorporates diverse prior knowledge from different pre-training paradigms to achieve strong few-shot learning performance. The key ideas are:- Leveraging models pre-trained with different paradigms - contrastive vision-language (CLIP), contrastive vision (DINO), generative language (GPT-3), and generative vision-language (DALL-E) - to provide complementary knowledge. - Cascading these models through a "Prompt, Generate, then Cache" pipeline:   - Use GPT-3 to generate semantic prompts to feed into CLIP   - Use DALL-E to generate additional synthetic training images   - Build a cache model with keys for CLIP and DINO predictions and fuse them adaptively- By prompting CLIP with richer text, expanding the limited training data at no extra labeling cost, and adaptively ensembling diverse predictions, CaFo achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance on 11 datasets without using any extra annotated data.In summary, the key contribution is a novel cascade paradigm that can effectively incorporate and collaborate diverse prior knowledge from major pre-training paradigms for improved few-shot learning. The results demonstrate the importance of unifying multiple self-supervised models in a principled framework to tackle data scarcity.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes CaFo, a cascade of foundation models that incorporates diverse prior knowledge from contrastive vision-language pre-training (CLIP), contrastive vision pre-training (DINO), generative language pre-training (GPT-3), and generative vision-language pre-training (DALL-E) to achieve state-of-the-art few-shot image classification performance. The key idea is to cascade the models in a "Prompt, Generate, then Cache" pipeline - use GPT-3 to create better prompts for CLIP, use DALL-E to generate more training data, and use a cache model to fuse CLIP and DINO predictions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in few-shot learning:- This paper proposes a new method called CaFo that combines multiple pre-trained models (CLIP, DINO, DALL-E, GPT-3) to improve few-shot learning. Most prior work focuses on adapting a single pre-trained model like CLIP. Combining multiple models with different pre-training objectives is a novel approach.- The key idea of "Prompt, Generate, then Cache" is new. Using GPT-3 to generate better prompts and DALL-E to synthesize more training images are creative ways to leverage large language and generative models. The caching mechanism to fuse CLIP and DINO is also novel. - The overall performance of CaFo seems very competitive or state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, it achieves 68.79% accuracy with only 20 epochs of training, outperforming prior methods like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter, Tip-Adapter, etc. The gains are consistent across many datasets.- The ablation studies are quite thorough in analyzing the contribution of different components. They help validate the efficacy of each model and the design choices.- The approach does not require any extra human annotated data, relying only on synthetic data from DALL-E. This is useful for tackling low-data regimes.- The training efficiency seems excellent - only 10 minutes of training to get SOTA results on ImageNet. Other methods need much longer (hours) to train.Overall, CaFo seems highly novel in its architecture and approach compared to prior few-shot learning methods. The results are state-of-the-art, while requiring less training time and data. The comprehensive experiments and analyses are also a strength. If I were to critique, perhaps more comparison on training time and computations could be helpful. But overall it looks like high quality, novel research advancing the state-of-the-art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Integrating more existing pre-trained knowledge into the proposed CaFo framework, such as other vision models like MAE and CrossPoint, to further improve performance. The authors suggest that CaFo could potentially collaborate with even more diverse pre-trained models.- Applying CaFo to other vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. The authors propose that CaFo's ability to adaptively incorporate diverse knowledge could benefit other vision tasks as well.- Developing strategies to better optimize and balance the different components of CaFo, such as finding the ideal prompts from GPT-3, number of generated images from DALL-E, and fusion weights between CLIP and DINO. There is room to further tune CaFo's modules.- Extending CaFo to few-shot learning in other modalities like video, point clouds, etc. The cascade framework could be applied to low-data regimes in other data modalities.- Improving the efficiency and scalability of CaFo to make it more practical for large-scale deployment. For example, investigating distillation strategies to compress the ensemble model.- Developing theoretical understandings of why and how CaFo is able to effectively integrate diverse self-supervised knowledge sources. Formal analysis could provide insights into how to better design model cascades.In summary, the main suggestions are to integrate more models into CaFo, apply it to more tasks and data types, further optimize the cascade components, improve efficiency for scalability, and develop theoretical analysis. The authors propose CaFo as a general framework for collaborating multiple self-supervised models that can be extended in many future directions.
