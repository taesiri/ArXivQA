# [One- and two-dimensional solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein   condensates with fractional kinetic energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.0404)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How does spin-orbit coupling (SOC) affect solitons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) composed of particles moving by Lévy flights? More specifically, can SOC help stabilize solitons against collapse in the 1D and 2D fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equations which model this BEC system?The key hypotheses are:- SOC terms may have a significant stabilizing effect on solitons in the 2D fractional system, creating stable semi-vortex (SV) and mixed-mode (MM) solitons in the range 1<α<2 where collapse occurs without SOC.- SOC will have a less dramatic effect in the 1D fractional system compared to the 2D case.The paper aims to test these hypotheses by deriving the theoretical framework, performing numerical simulations, and analyzing the results. The goal is to elucidate the impact of SOC on soliton stability in fractional BEC systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper studies solitons in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with fractional kinetic energy. The main contributions are:- It introduces a phenomenological model for spin-orbit coupling in a fractional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. - It finds that in 1D, the spin-orbit coupling reduces the critical norm for collapse when the Lévy index α=1, but otherwise does not have a major effect. - In 2D, the spin-orbit coupling enables the formation of stable semi-vortex and mixed-mode solitons in the interval 1<α<2, where supercritical collapse prevents solitons without spin-orbit coupling. - Variational approximations and numerical solutions are used to analyze the soliton families and their stability.- Scaling relations are derived for how the soliton amplitude vanishes as the spin-orbit coupling strength goes to zero.In summary, the paper shows spin-orbit coupling can stabilize solitons in 2D fractional Bose-Einstein condensates, opening up soliton families where collapse would occur without it. The stabilization effect is studied both numerically and analytically.
