# [You Can Run but not Hide: Improving Gait Recognition with Intrinsic   Occlusion Type Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Gait recognition aims to identify individuals by analyzing their walking patterns. Most current techniques assume full visibility of the body and fail under partial occlusions. However, occlusions frequently occur in uncontrolled, outdoor scenarios which are becoming important for gait recognition research. Occlusions corrupt gait signatures as models try to look for missing body parts. Thus, occlusion handling is an important unsolved problem in gait recognition.

Method: 
The authors propose a novel occlusion aware approach to improve gait recognition under occlusions. The key ideas are:

1) Train an auxiliary occlusion detection module on classifying occlusion types on silhouettes. At test time, use its features without the classifier to inject occlusion awareness into the gait recognition backbone.

2) Insert these occlusion aware features at optimal deferred locations in the backbone through a learnable transformation to guide feature learning.

3) Enhance potentially any gait recognition model by making it occlusion aware in this manner.

The method handles both static and dynamic occlusions effectively. The occlusion detector generalizes well to unseen occlusion types.

Experiments:
Experiments were performed on challenging datasets - BRIAR and GREW, using multiple state-of-the-art backbones like GaitGL, GaitPart and GaitBase. The method consistently outperforms regular training and zero-shot evaluation under occlusions by 4-23%. Analysis revealed optimal design choices to inject occlusion awareness. The approach also generalizes to new occlusion types not seen during training.

Conclusion:
The paper proposed an elegant occlusion handling approach through intrinsic occlusion awareness that can enhance any gait recognition technique. It demonstrates considerable gains over multiple datasets and backbones. The idea of guiding models via auxiliary tasks shows promise for vision problems with multiple challenges.
