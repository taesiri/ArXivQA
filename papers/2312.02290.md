# [You Can Run but not Hide: Improving Gait Recognition with Intrinsic   Occlusion Type Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Gait recognition aims to identify individuals by analyzing their walking patterns. Most current techniques assume full visibility of the body and fail under partial occlusions. However, occlusions frequently occur in uncontrolled, outdoor scenarios which are becoming important for gait recognition research. Occlusions corrupt gait signatures as models try to look for missing body parts. Thus, occlusion handling is an important unsolved problem in gait recognition.

Method: 
The authors propose a novel occlusion aware approach to improve gait recognition under occlusions. The key ideas are:

1) Train an auxiliary occlusion detection module on classifying occlusion types on silhouettes. At test time, use its features without the classifier to inject occlusion awareness into the gait recognition backbone.

2) Insert these occlusion aware features at optimal deferred locations in the backbone through a learnable transformation to guide feature learning.

3) Enhance potentially any gait recognition model by making it occlusion aware in this manner.

The method handles both static and dynamic occlusions effectively. The occlusion detector generalizes well to unseen occlusion types.

Experiments:
Experiments were performed on challenging datasets - BRIAR and GREW, using multiple state-of-the-art backbones like GaitGL, GaitPart and GaitBase. The method consistently outperforms regular training and zero-shot evaluation under occlusions by 4-23%. Analysis revealed optimal design choices to inject occlusion awareness. The approach also generalizes to new occlusion types not seen during training.

Conclusion:
The paper proposed an elegant occlusion handling approach through intrinsic occlusion awareness that can enhance any gait recognition technique. It demonstrates considerable gains over multiple datasets and backbones. The idea of guiding models via auxiliary tasks shows promise for vision problems with multiple challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an occlusion aware gait recognition method by using an auxiliary occlusion detection module to inject occlusion information into a gait recognition backbone to help it generate better identity features under occlusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel model-agnostic, occlusion aware method for gait recognition in uncontrolled environments. Specifically:

1) They propose an occlusion aware approach that can be integrated into potentially any state-of-the-art gait recognition method to enhance performance under occlusion. 

2) They design an auxiliary occlusion detection module to generate occlusion encodings/features and show these contain useful information to facilitate learning of effective discriminative features for occluded gait recognition.

3) Through experiments, they explore various approaches to effectively utilize the occlusion information to optimize model training under occlusion scenarios.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an occlusion aware framework that can provide performance gains under occlusions for gait recognition models by leveraging occlusion encodings from an auxiliary module. The method is model-agnostic so it can be integrated with different state-of-the-art architectures.

The paper proposes an occlusion aware approach to gait recognition that involves training an auxiliary occlusion detection module on different types of synthetic occlusions.
