# [Crystal: Introspective Reasoners Reinforced with Self-Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04921)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses that this paper addresses are:

1. How can we develop commonsense reasoning models that are more performant and interpretable? 

The paper hypothesizes that by having the model explicitly introspect relevant knowledge statements and ground its reasoning in those statements, it can improve both accuracy and interpretability on commonsense QA tasks.

2. How can we enable stronger mutual adaptation between knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning?

The paper hypothesizes that using reinforcement learning to optimize both the knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning components, with a novel interleaved optimization schedule, can enable tighter coupling and bidirectional adaptation between these two model components.  

3. Can training a model with its own self-generated feedback be an effective approach?

The paper introduces a novel method of training an introspective reasoner by reinforcing it with rewards derived from feedback (predicted answers) generated by itself. It hypothesizes this self-supervision approach can be viable and beneficial.

So in summary, the key research questions revolve around developing more accurate and interpretable commonsense reasoning models via introspective reasoning and tighter coupling of reasoning components, as well as exploring the potential of reinforcing models with their own self-generated feedback. The paper aims to validate these hypotheses through empirical experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a novel method called \methodname{} for commonsense reasoning. The main contributions are:

1. It proposes the concept of "introspective reasoning", where a model first generates relevant knowledge statements about a question, and then makes a prediction grounded in that knowledge. This makes the reasoning process more interpretable. 

2. \methodname{} is a unified model that does both knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The two modes are trained to mutually adapt using reinforcement learning.

3. The knowledge introspection mode is trained via RL to generate knowledge that can fix errors made by the knowledge-grounded reasoning mode. So the model gets feedback from itself. 

4. The training uses an interleaved optimization schedule inspired by EM algorithm to harmonize the two objectives of adapting knowledge introspection and adaptation of reasoning.

5. The RL training is preceded by an imitation learning stage where the model acquires initial skills by learning from a larger LM. 

6. The RL algorithm PPO is made more efficient by sharing parameters across policy, value and reward models. This allows scaling up.

7. Experiments show \methodname{} outperforms both standard supervised training and chain-of-thought distillation methods, while enhancing interpretability.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing introspective reasoning, the unified and mutually adaptive model design, reinforcing the model with self-feedback, and showing strong empirical results. The work highlights the potential of training models with self-generated feedback.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Crystal to develop introspective commonsense reasoning models that generate knowledge statements related to the question, then make predictions grounded in that knowledge, with the knowledge generation and reasoning components trained via reinforcement learning to mutually adapt using self-generated feedback.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel method called Crystalline to develop an introspective commonsense reasoning model. Here is a summary of how it relates to other relevant work:

- Knowledge-augmented reasoning methods: Most prior work uses separate models for knowledge generation and reasoning, relies on task-specific engineering of the knowledge generator, and does not enable mutual adaptation between the two components. Crystalline is the first to use a unified model and allow bidirectional influence between knowledge introspection and reasoning. 

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation: CoT methods teach smaller LMs multi-step reasoning by distilling reasoning chains from large LMs. However, CoT chains often lack commonsense relevance and coherence with final predictions. Crystalline captures the introspective nature of commonsense knowledge, and uses reinforcement learning to align reasoning and predictions.

- Improving from self-feedback: Some recent papers train LMs on their own self-generated reasoning chains when they lead to correct predictions. Crystalline uniquely uses reinforcement learning and a self-derived reward signal for improvement from self-feedback.

- Knowledge introspection: Crystalline builds on prior work on dedicated knowledge introspection models like Rainier, but integrates it into a unified reasoning model and enables bidirectional tuning between knowledge generation and reasoning.

Overall, Crystalline proposes a novel introspective reasoning approach that comprehensively addresses multiple limitations in prior methods through its unified model design, reinforcement learning framework, and mutual adaptation of the knowledge and reasoning components. The results validate the benefits of its innovations over existing knowledge-augmented reasoning and chain-of-thought distillation techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Developing more advanced methods for tuning the knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning modes of the model. They indicate there is room for improvement in how these two modes are mutually adapted during training.

- Exploring different reward functions and reinforcement learning algorithms when training the knowledge introspection mode. The current reward function and PPO algorithm have limitations that could be addressed.

- Generalizing the approach to other commonsense reasoning tasks beyond question answering, such as narrative understanding. The introspective reasoning framework may be useful for other applications. 

- Applying introspective reasoning models to practical systems to study their utility and limitations in real-world settings. The paper focuses on offline experimental evaluation.

- Conducting more in-depth interpretability analysis on the knowledge generated during introspection. This could reveal insights into the model's reasoning process.

- Investigating social biases that may be present in the training data and how they could affect the knowledge introspected by the model. Fairness and ethics of AI systems are important considerations.

- Continuing to scale up introspective reasoning models and benchmark their capabilities relative to humans. There are still significant gaps between model and human performance on commonsense tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more advanced training techniques, generalizing the approach to new domains, testing real-world applicability, and further analysis on interpretability, fairness, and capabilities relative to human reasoning. Advancing introspective reasoning remains an open and promising research area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Crystal, a novel method for training an introspective commonsense reasoning model. Crystal is a unified model with two modes - knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning. For a given question, it first generates relevant knowledge statements, then makes a prediction grounded in that knowledge. Crystal is trained via reinforcement learning to optimize the synergy between the two modes. Specifically, the knowledge introspection mode is trained using PPO to maximize a reward related to whether the knowledge statements can fix errors in the knowledge-grounded reasoning. This provides a self-feedback signal to improve the model. Experiments on 25 QA datasets show Crystal outperforms standard supervised training and chain-of-thought distillation baselines, demonstrating the benefit of introspective reasoning and self-reinforcement. The model sharing in the PPO algorithm also enables efficient training. Overall, the work illustrates the promise of reinforcing neural models using their own feedback.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to develop an introspective commonsense reasoning model called Crystal. The key idea is that commonsense reasoning requires generating relevant knowledge statements related to the question, and then making an informed prediction grounded in that knowledge. To achieve this, Crystal has two modes - knowledge introspection to generate relevant knowledge, and knowledge-grounded reasoning to make a prediction using the generated knowledge. 

Crystal is trained using reinforcement learning to improve the alignment between the generated knowledge and final predictions. Specifically, the knowledge introspection mode is trained via PPO to optimize a reward function that measures if the knowledge can fix errors in the knowledge-grounded reasoning predictions. Concurrently, the knowledge-grounded reasoning mode evolves to better utilize the introspected knowledge. The two modes are trained in an interleaved manner resembling EM algorithm. Experiments on 25 QA datasets show Crystal outperforms standard finetuning and chain-of-thought distillation methods, demonstrating the benefits of introspective reasoning and the viability of self-reinforcement.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called \methodname{} to develop an introspective commonsense reasoner. \methodname{} is a unified model with two modes - knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning. For a given question, it first generates relevant knowledge statements using the knowledge introspection mode. It then utilizes these knowledge statements along with the question as input to the knowledge-grounded reasoning mode to make a final prediction. The two modes are trained together using reinforcement learning (RL) to enable mutual adaptation. Specifically, the knowledge introspection mode is trained via RL to generate knowledge that can fix errors made by the knowledge-grounded reasoning mode. This provides a self-feedback signal to reinforce the model. Meanwhile, the knowledge-grounded reasoning mode is also continuously updated to better leverage the introspected knowledge. The training employs a two-stage process - first imitation learning to acquire basic skills, followed by the RL-based tuning. Additionally, the training objectives are interleaved rather than optimized jointly. This approach allows \methodname{} to conduct more accurate and interpretable reasoning compared to prior methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper seems to be addressing the issue of improving commonsense reasoning abilities and interpretability in language models. Some key points:

- Commonsense reasoning is challenging for models as it often relies on intuitive knowledge that is hard to explicitly capture. This is different from logical or multi-step reasoning where the reasoning steps are more clear.

- Generating reasoning chains/explanations is useful for commonsense reasoning, but existing methods like chain-of-thought have issues: the reasoning steps don't provide meaningful insight, and the end task performance is lower than finetuned models. 

- Knowledge-augmented reasoning methods that generate relevant knowledge statements can improve performance and interpretability, but they have limitations: knowledge generator and reasoner are often separate models, knowledge generation relies on task-specific engineering, and there is no comprehensive optimization of the bidirectional interaction between knowledge generation and reasoning.

- The paper proposes an "introspective reasoning" model called Crystal which has integrated knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning modes. It generates knowledge statements related to the question, and then makes a prediction grounded in that knowledge.

- Crystal is trained with reinforcement learning to improve alignment between the generated knowledge and final predictions. The knowledge introspection mode is rewarded based on whether it provides knowledge that helps fix errors in the reasoning mode. 

- This allows comprehensive optimization of knowledge generation and reasoning, as well as interpretability of the full reasoning process within a unified model. The self-reinforcement from model feedback is a novel aspect.

In summary, the key focus is improving commonsense reasoning performance and interpretability in language models through an introspective reasoning approach with integrated knowledge generation and grounding, trained via reinforcement from self-feedback.
