# [Towards Controllable Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Controllable Time Series Generation":

Problem:
- Time series generation (TSG) methods struggle with data scarcity, especially for rare or unique conditions. They have limited controllability to adapt the generated data to various external conditions.
- Existing conditional TSG methods rely on large labeled datasets and cannot handle complex relationships between conditions. 
- Disentangled VAE models for controllable image generation make tradeoffs between generation quality and controllability, and are designed for images rather than time series.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Controllable Time Series Generation (CTSG) to address data scarcity by generating realistic time series adapted to diverse user-specified conditions.
- A new framework called CTS is proposed, which is VAE-agnostic and decouples the mapping between conditions and latent features from the VAE training.
- CTS has customized modules for time series generation, condition clustering, data selection and condition mapping to enable precise control over generated data.
- For data selection, CTS uses diverse condition selection and nearest neighbor search to identify relevant training samples covering a variety of conditions.
- For condition mapping, CTS employs interpretable models like decision trees to map conditions to latent features.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the new problem of CTSG and a comprehensive evaluation scheme for it.
- A versatile, explainable CTS framework for CTSG that is VAE-agnostic and decouples condition mapping from VAE training.
- Effective data selection and transparent condition mapping modules for precise user control over generated time series.
- Extensive experiments showing CTS's exceptional performance in generating high quality, controllable time series across multiple real-world datasets.
- Demonstration of CTS's versatility by application to controllable image generation, outperforming state-of-the-art disentangled VAEs.

In summary, the paper pioneers the new field of CTSG, with CTS being the first tailored solution for this problem. CTS advances controllable generation for tackling data scarcity across different data modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CTS, an innovative VAE-agnostic framework for controllable time series generation that decouples the mapping process from VAE training to enable precise learning of complex interplay between latent features and external conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing CTS (Controllable Time Series), a novel VAE-agnostic framework tailored for the new problem of Controllable Time Series Generation (CTSG). CTS has several key features:

1) It decouples the mapping process from standard VAE training, allowing for customized learning of the relationships between latent features and external conditions to enhance controllability. 

2) It is VAE-agnostic, able to accommodate different VAE variants and harness their strengths for optimal time series generation.

3) It incorporates transparent data selection and condition mapping modules to discern intricate relationships between conditions and latent features. This also boosts the framework's explainability.

4) It introduces a comprehensive evaluation scheme for CTSG focused on assessing generation fidelity, attribute coherence, and controllability.

5) Extensive experiments on time series and image datasets demonstrate CTS's exceptional capabilities in producing high-quality, controllable outputs. This showcases its adeptness in adapting latent features to altered external conditions.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel CTS framework to address the new CTSG problem and enable controllable time series generation, especially in data-scarce scenarios. CTS advances the state-of-the-art through its innovative design and exceptional performance.
