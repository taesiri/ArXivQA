# [Towards Controllable Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Controllable Time Series Generation":

Problem:
- Time series generation (TSG) methods struggle with data scarcity, especially for rare or unique conditions. They have limited controllability to adapt the generated data to various external conditions.
- Existing conditional TSG methods rely on large labeled datasets and cannot handle complex relationships between conditions. 
- Disentangled VAE models for controllable image generation make tradeoffs between generation quality and controllability, and are designed for images rather than time series.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Controllable Time Series Generation (CTSG) to address data scarcity by generating realistic time series adapted to diverse user-specified conditions.
- A new framework called CTS is proposed, which is VAE-agnostic and decouples the mapping between conditions and latent features from the VAE training.
- CTS has customized modules for time series generation, condition clustering, data selection and condition mapping to enable precise control over generated data.
- For data selection, CTS uses diverse condition selection and nearest neighbor search to identify relevant training samples covering a variety of conditions.
- For condition mapping, CTS employs interpretable models like decision trees to map conditions to latent features.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the new problem of CTSG and a comprehensive evaluation scheme for it.
- A versatile, explainable CTS framework for CTSG that is VAE-agnostic and decouples condition mapping from VAE training.
- Effective data selection and transparent condition mapping modules for precise user control over generated time series.
- Extensive experiments showing CTS's exceptional performance in generating high quality, controllable time series across multiple real-world datasets.
- Demonstration of CTS's versatility by application to controllable image generation, outperforming state-of-the-art disentangled VAEs.

In summary, the paper pioneers the new field of CTSG, with CTS being the first tailored solution for this problem. CTS advances controllable generation for tackling data scarcity across different data modalities.
