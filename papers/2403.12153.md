# [Routing and Scheduling in Answer Set Programming applied to Multi-Agent   Path Finding: Preliminary Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12153)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of routing and scheduling in Answer Set Programming (ASP). Traditional approaches in ASP use time steps to model temporal aspects like action durations. However, representing fine-grained timings in ASP is infeasible as it leads to a blow up in the groundings. The paper explores an alternative approach using partial orders and difference constraints to model time while avoiding explicit time steps.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to capture flows of time using partial orders on events (agent positions) rather than explicit time points attached to actions. This removes the need for horizons and bounds on plan lengths. However, temporal trajectories must be acyclic now since multiple occurrences of actions/fluents cannot be distinguished anymore. 

The paper first looks at routing in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) without considering durations. It characterizes MAPF solutions using conflict-free, path-based, partially ordered event sets. This serves as an abstraction for MAPF plans. An ASP encoding is presented that uses acyclicity constraints to find such event orderings.

For scheduling, the paper extends the concepts to handle action durations in MAPF. Now arrival times are associated with events instead of just orders. The encoding is augmented with difference constraints that enforce appropriate time distances between events. This outsources the temporal reasoning to the underlying constraint propagator.

Contributions:

- Formalization of MAPF solutions in terms of partially ordered event sets/arrival time mappings

- Novel ASP encodings for MAPF using acyclicity/difference constraints instead of explicit time steps

- Avoiding plan length limits and grounding blowups

- Seamless integration of routing and scheduling without changing the core encoding

- Empirical analysis showing performance gains over vanilla ASP encodings

The key insight is representing time as partial orders and outsourcing detailed scheduling aspects to constraints. This provides an efficient technique for combining routing and scheduling in ASP.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents alternative approaches to routing and scheduling in Answer Set Programming by capturing flows of time in terms of partial orders on actions and fluents rather than explicit time steps, eliminating the need for fixed bounds on plan lengths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting alternative approaches to routing and scheduling in Answer Set Programming (ASP) for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems. Specifically:

- It introduces a characterization of MAPF based on ordering events that represent agent positions over time. This allows dropping explicit time steps and bounds on plan lengths.

- For scheduling, it combines the event ordering idea with difference constraints to associate durations and arrival times with events. This allows efficient propagation of timing constraints in ASP while keeping the representation compact. 

- It provides several ASP encodings for MAPF following the traditional approach with time steps as well as the novel event ordering approach with acyclicity and difference constraints. Soundness and completeness results are given.

- It empirically analyzes the spectrum of ASP encodings on MAPF benchmarks capturing different scenarios. The experiments confirm the competitiveness of the event ordering approach, especially when augmented with difference constraints.

In summary, the key innovation is an event-based modeling approach that exploits acyclicity and difference constraints to compactly represent timing and ordering in ASP encodings without explicitly enumerating time steps. This shows promise for tackling routing and scheduling problems.

The paper explores alternative approaches to routing and scheduling in ASP, applying them to the multi-agent path finding problem. Key ideas include capturing flows of time via partial orders on events rather than explicit time steps, using acyclicity and difference constraints to enforce consistency of these orders, and developing ASP encodings that are provably sound and complete.

Overall, the paper provides a formal foundation and empirical analysis for these ASP encoding techniques in the context of routing and scheduling.
