# [Time-Series Classification for Dynamic Strategies in Multi-Step   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08373)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-step time series forecasting is fundamental but it is unclear which forecasting strategy (e.g. direct, recursive) performs best a priori. 
- Current approaches use a single fixed strategy, but optimal strategy likely varies for different time series instances.

Proposed Solution: 
- Characterize instance-level variance in optimal strategy on time series datasets.  
- Propose DyStrat - a framework to dynamically select forecasting strategy per time series instance using time series classification. Train classifier on instance-level optimal strategies.
- Evaluate DyStrat against fixed strategies on 10 time series datasets across domains, horizon lengths, and model complexities.

Main Contributions:
- Show high instance-level variance in optimal strategy, indicating potential for improvements with dynamic strategy selection.
- DyStrat reduces forecast error by 11% on average compared to best fixed strategy, which is unknown a priori. 
- DyStrat typically triples top-1 accuracy of strategy selection compared to fixed approaches.
- Demonstrate DyStrat generalizes well as a simple add-on for any multi-step forecasting task.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the benefit of dynamic strategy selection in multi-step time series forecasting and proposes an effective framework, DyStrat, to achieve significantly improved forecast accuracy by selecting optimal strategies per time series instance.
