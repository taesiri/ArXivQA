# [RoboSync: OS for Social Robots with Customizable Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional robotic systems are complex to implement and not easily accessible for developers of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications. There is a need for a platform that simplifies HRI application development by allowing non-experts to easily customize robot behaviors and responses.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes RoboSync, a novel real-time operating system (RTOS) designed specifically for customizable social HRI applications. The key ideas are:

1) Multi-level abstraction layers that enable non-experts to define complex behavioral models without deep technical expertise. This includes a behavior modeling layer, machine learning plugin layer, sensor customization layer, etc.

2) Modular software architecture comprising distinct components: behavior modeling, ML algorithms, sensor processing, scheduling, and communication/synchronization. This ensures adaptability, upgradability and simplicity.

3) An efficient scheduler and communication layer that manages the modules and ensures timely, seamless execution and data transfers.

4) Use of a domain-specific language (DSL) to allow intuitive programming of robot behaviors and responses based on sensor inputs and modeled states.

5) Ability to easily integrate and configure machine learning models to leverage advanced perception capabilities.

Main Contributions:

1) RTOS architecture specialized for customizable social HRI, balancing simplicity, efficiency, flexibility and accessibility for non-experts. 

2) Abstraction layers that hide complexity allowing easy behavior definitions.

3) Modular components that enable independent customizations. 

4) DSL for intuitive robot behavior programming.

5) ML plugin integration for advanced perception.

6) Efficient scheduler and communication for responsiveness.

The core RTOS functionality was implemented on a CortexM4 processor to demonstrate feasibility. By simplifying HRI application development, RoboSync has the potential to make social robots more accessible to a wider range of users.
