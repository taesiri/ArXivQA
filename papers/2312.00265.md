# [RoboSync: OS for Social Robots with Customizable Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00265)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces RoboSync, a novel real-time operating system (RTOS) designed specifically for customizable human-robot interaction (HRI) applications. The system features multi-level abstraction layers that enable non-expert users to easily define complex emotional and behavioral models for social robots. Its modular architecture includes a behavior modeling layer for specifying responses, a machine learning configuration layer for integrating algorithms, a sensor customization layer, an HRI-optimized scheduler, and a communication/synchronization module. By simplifying interaction design without sacrificing real-time performance or flexibility, RoboSync aims to make social robotics more accessible. A proof-of-concept implementation on a CortexM4 processor demonstrates the potential - the essential system structure and key components like the high-level abstraction layer, scheduler, and communication protocols have been realized. Evaluations reveal significantly reduced development time compared to traditional approaches. Ultimately, this accessible and adaptable RTOS architecture can facilitate broader user engagement with customizable social robots across diverse HRI applications.
