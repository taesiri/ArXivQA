# A Survey of Data Augmentation Approaches for NLP

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, this paper does not seem to have a single central research question or hypothesis. Instead, it appears to be a broad survey of the field of data augmentation techniques for natural language processing (NLP). The key goals and contributions of the paper seem to be:- To provide a structured overview and summary of data augmentation techniques that have been developed for NLP. The paper categorizes these techniques into rule-based, example interpolation-based, and model-based.- To highlight data augmentation techniques useful for common NLP applications such as low-resource languages, bias mitigation, class imbalance, few-shot learning, and adversarial examples.- To discuss data augmentation methods proposed for major NLP tasks such as summarization, QA, sequence tagging, parsing, error correction, translation, generation, etc.- To outline current challenges and future directions for research on data augmentation in NLP.So in summary, this paper aims to provide a broad survey and synthesis of the existing literature on data augmentation for NLP. It does not appear to have a single central hypothesis or research question that it is testing. The goal is to organize, summarize and call attention to this increasingly important research area within NLP.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of data augmentation techniques for natural language processing (NLP). The key contributions are:- It provides background on what data augmentation is, its goals and trade-offs, and why it works. - It categorizes and describes major representative data augmentation techniques for NLP, including rule-based, example interpolation, and model-based techniques.- It discusses data augmentation techniques that have been applied for various useful NLP applications, such as low-resource languages, bias mitigation, few-shot learning, etc.- It covers data augmentation methods proposed for major NLP tasks, focusing on non-classification tasks like summarization, QA, parsing, dialogue, etc. - It outlines current challenges and future directions for data augmentation in NLP.Overall, this paper aims to provide a structured overview of the landscape of data augmentation techniques and research in NLP. It highlights that while there has been increased interest in this area, it is still relatively underexplored and has many open challenges. The paper seeks to draw further attention to data augmentation for NLP and motivate additional work. The comprehensive survey nature and coverage of both techniques and applications across NLP makes this a significant contribution.
