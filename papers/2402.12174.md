# [BIDER: Bridging Knowledge Inconsistency for Efficient   Retrieval-Augmented LLMs via Key Supporting Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) incorporate external knowledge to enhance reliability and quality of generated text. However, inconsistencies between retrieved knowledge and LLM's needs can reduce answer quality. Retrieved documents tend to be lengthy and noisy, detrimentally affecting LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose BIDER to refine retrieval documents into Key Supporting Evidence (KSE) - the essential knowledge required by LLM to answer questions.  

- BIDER training has 3 stages:
   1) Knowledge Synthesis: Meticulously construct KSE from retrieved documents through nugget extraction, refinement and cleaning.
   2) Supervised Fine-Tuning: Train BIDER as a seq2seq model to map retrieval documents to constructed KSE.
   3) Preference Alignment: Use RL to align BIDER's outputs to LLM's preferences.

- BIDER takes retrieved documents as input and outputs refined KSE tailored to needs of LLM. LLM then uses refined KSE to generate high-quality responses.

Main Contributions:
- Propose method to synthesize KSE to capture essential knowledge for answering questions
- Introduce BIDER to transform retrieval documents into KSE via supervised and reinforcement learning
- Demonstrate BIDER boosts LLM performance by 7% while reducing input length by 80%, outperforming existing methods

The key innovation is using carefully constructed KSE to supervise BIDER training, enabling it to provide LLM with coherent and digestible information to substantially improve answer quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes BIDER, a method to refine noisy retrieved documents into key supporting evidence by knowledge synthesis, supervised fine-tuning, and preference alignment, which boosts the performance of retrieval-augmented language models for knowledge-intensive tasks while significantly reducing the input length.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a three-step method to synthesize authentic key supporting evidence (KSE) to train the refiner model. This includes nugget extraction, nugget refinement, and nugget cleaning.

2. Introducing BIDER, an approach to refine retrieval documents into KSE in order to bridge the knowledge inconsistency between retrieval results and the knowledge required by the language model to answer questions.

3. Training BIDER using both supervised learning to distill KSE and reinforcement learning to align the model with the language model's preferences. This allows providing the language model with coherent and easily digestible key information.

4. Evaluating BIDER on five datasets across three tasks - open-domain QA, dialogue, and fact checking. Results show BIDER boosts the language model's answer quality by 7% while reducing input length by 80%, outperforming existing methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective approach called BIDER to refine retrieval documents into key supporting evidence, which bridges knowledge inconsistencies and enhances the performance of retrieval augmented language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the core issue that BIDER aims to address regarding knowledge inconsistency in retrieval-augmented large language models? Explain the key components of BIDER's approach to bridge this inconsistency.  

2. Explain the 3 steps of the knowledge synthesis stage in detail. What is the purpose and rationale behind each step? How do they work together to construct high-quality training data?

3. What are the advantages of modeling the task in the supervised distillation stage as a seq2seq problem compared to a ranking formulation? How does seq2seq modeling enhance BIDER's refinement capability? 

4. Discuss the segmented reward mechanism designed for the preference alignment stage. Why is a segmented reward more suitable than a token-level reward for guiding the alignment of the refiner with the generator?  

5. Analyze the results in Table 3 regarding the impact of preference alignment. What specifically does this experiment demonstrate about how the alignment enhances the refined text for the generator?

6. What are the limitations of evaluating BIDER only on Wikipedia-based datasets as discussed at the end? How might BIDER need to be adapted to work effectively for real-world RAG applications?

7. The paper argues that relying solely on the generator's feedback for training is insufficient. Explain this argument and discuss how BIDER's training methodology addresses this issue.  

8. Discuss the robustness evaluation under different retriever qualities. What does this analysis reveal about the strengths of BIDER?

9. How suitable do you think the BIDER approach would be for low-resource settings where less training data is available? Explain your view.

10. The related work discusses the instability of LLM feedback as a limitation of prior methods. Analyze how BIDER overcomes this specific challenge through its multi-stage training process.
