# [BIDER: Bridging Knowledge Inconsistency for Efficient   Retrieval-Augmented LLMs via Key Supporting Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) incorporate external knowledge to enhance reliability and quality of generated text. However, inconsistencies between retrieved knowledge and LLM's needs can reduce answer quality. Retrieved documents tend to be lengthy and noisy, detrimentally affecting LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose BIDER to refine retrieval documents into Key Supporting Evidence (KSE) - the essential knowledge required by LLM to answer questions.  

- BIDER training has 3 stages:
   1) Knowledge Synthesis: Meticulously construct KSE from retrieved documents through nugget extraction, refinement and cleaning.
   2) Supervised Fine-Tuning: Train BIDER as a seq2seq model to map retrieval documents to constructed KSE.
   3) Preference Alignment: Use RL to align BIDER's outputs to LLM's preferences.

- BIDER takes retrieved documents as input and outputs refined KSE tailored to needs of LLM. LLM then uses refined KSE to generate high-quality responses.

Main Contributions:
- Propose method to synthesize KSE to capture essential knowledge for answering questions
- Introduce BIDER to transform retrieval documents into KSE via supervised and reinforcement learning
- Demonstrate BIDER boosts LLM performance by 7% while reducing input length by 80%, outperforming existing methods

The key innovation is using carefully constructed KSE to supervise BIDER training, enabling it to provide LLM with coherent and digestible information to substantially improve answer quality.
