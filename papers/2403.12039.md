# [StereoNavNet: Learning to Navigate using Stereo Cameras with Auxiliary   Occupancy Voxels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Visual navigation for robots relies heavily on semantic features from visual encoders, requiring large datasets and resulting in limited generalizability. In contrast, traditional navigation planners operate on geometric representations like occupancy grids, but require accurate sensing. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes StereoNavNet (SNN), a novel end-to-end modular visual navigation network with a perception module and a policy module. The perception module takes stereo RGB images as input and outputs an occupancy voxel grid representation without assuming ground truth depth access. The policy module takes the geometric features from this grid along with goal coordinates as input to output velocity actions.

Key Contributions:
1) Proposes a visual navigation network that incorporates an intermediate 3D geometric representation from stereo images without ground truth depth.
2) Perception and policy modules are trained modularly before end-to-end fine-tuning. Modular learning improves sim-to-real transfer. 
3) Extensive experiments in simulation comparing against semantic, monocular depth, stereo depth and upper bound geometric baselines. SNN outperforms in terms of success rate, path length and navigation error in seen and novel scenes.
4) SNN exhibits better generalizability than semantic baseline when tested in novel scenes. Computation analysis shows SNN is efficient for real-time navigation.

In summary, the paper presents StereoNavNet, a novel end-to-end modular hybrid visual navigation approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance by incorporating an intermediate geometric representation from stereo images. The modular design and geometric features lead to improved efficiency, accuracy and generalizability.
