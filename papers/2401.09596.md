# [Efficient generative adversarial networks using linear   additive-attention Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising results for image generation. However, their training instability and high computational demands have limited their adoption. Recent transformer-based GANs achieve good performance but suffer from quadratic complexity and training instability. On the other hand, diffusion models can match GANs quality with a computationally expensive multi-step generation process. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LadaGAN, an efficient GAN architecture for image generation based on a novel Transformer block called Ladaformer. The key component of Ladaformer is a linear additive attention mechanism that reduces the complexity from quadratic to linear. LadaGAN incorporates Ladaformer blocks in both generator and discriminator.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes Ladaformer, a novel Transformer block with linear additive attention, which is more stable and efficient than convolutional and transformer GAN blocks.

- Introduces LadaGAN architecture employing Ladaformer in both generator and discriminator, which allows long sequence processing in both networks.

- Shows Ladaformer attention is compatible with convolutions, providing performance benefits without instability.

- Demonstrates LadaGAN matches state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models across datasets, with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs.

- Analysis indicates LadaGAN has stable gradients and outperforms other efficient Transformers (Linformer, Fastformer, Swin Transformer).

- LadaGAN reduces computational demands, advancing applicability of GANs and reducing environment impact.

In summary, LadaGAN enables efficient and stable GAN training using linear additive attention Transformers. It provides state-of-the-art image generation quality with low computational requirements. The proposed Ladaformer block and its compatibility with convolutions open up further research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 LadaGAN is an efficient generative adversarial network for image generation that employs a novel linear additive-attention Transformer block called Ladaformer, achieving competitive performance to state-of-the-art models with significantly lower computational requirements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LadaGAN, an efficient generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture for image generation that is based on linear additive-attention Transformers called Ladaformers. The key properties and benefits of LadaGAN highlighted in the paper are:

- It uses a novel Ladaformer block in both the generator and discriminator, which employs a linear additive attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear. This allows processing long sequences efficiently.

- LadaGAN combines the inductive biases of self-attention and convolutions, overcoming training instabilities typically associated with Transformer GANs. Experiments show Ladaformer has stable gradients and is compatible with convolutions.

- It achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results compared to convolutional and Transformer GANs on various image datasets, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs. For example, it requires only 8.9% of StyleGAN2's FLOPs on 64x64 images.

- It also shows comparable performance to multi-step generative models like Diffusion Models and Consistency Training, but with orders of magnitude lower computational cost as it is a single-step generator.

So in summary, LadaGAN enables efficient and stable training of high-performance GANs for image generation using linear additive attention Transformers combined with convolutions. The efficiency gains open up applications with limited compute budgets.
