# [Who is leading in AI? An analysis of industry AI research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- AI research is increasingly industry-driven, making it important to understand company contributions to AI progress. Prior work has focused on country-level analyses or academic institutions, while this paper compares leading AI companies.

Methodology 
- The analysis utilizes three datasets: AI publications from OpenAlex (2010-2023), AI training compute data, and a novel dataset of key innovations in large language models.

- Companies are compared across four metrics: number of publications, number of citations, size of largest training runs, and adoption frequency of their algorithmic innovations in major language models.

Key Findings
- Google, OpenAI and Meta lead across the metrics, having developed some of the largest models, published highly cited papers, and created widely adopted innovations like the Transformer and prompting techniques.  

- OpenAI rapidly matched then exceeded frontier training compute previously set by Google, enabled through a partnership with Microsoft. Meta has trailed behind in scaling compute.  

- Leading Chinese companies like Tencent and Baidu lag significantly behind US counterparts in citation impact per researcher and adoption of innovations.  

- Newer companies like Anthropic have already matched training compute milestones of more established firms.

Implications
- The analysis provides empirical evidence of the capabilities and rapid growth of leading AI companies, especially a few US tech giants steering progress. This informs AI policy discussions.

- There are signs of a potential talent gap between Chinese and US industry AI labs. However, continued scaling of resources by Chinese firms may compensate over time.
