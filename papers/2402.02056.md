# [AnthroScore: A Computational Linguistic Measure of Anthropomorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02056)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Anthropomorphism (attributing human-like qualities to non-human entities) of technology like AI systems can lead to misleading narratives and overstated capabilities. However, there are currently no computational methods to quantify anthropomorphism. 

Proposed Solution - AnthroScore:
- The authors propose AnthroScore, a metric that compares how likely an entity is to be implicitly framed as human versus non-human in the surrounding textual context, using a masked language model.

- AnthroScore is calculated by masking mentions of non-human entities in sentences, getting probability distributions over replacing the mask with human vs non-human pronouns from a language model, and taking the log odds ratio.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate AnthroScore correlates with human judgments of anthropomorphism.
- Use AnthroScore to analyze 15 years of CS/AI papers and news articles. Find anthropomorphism is increasing over time, especially in ACL papers, and is higher in news than papers.
- Analyze linguistic factors related to anthropomorphism like reporting verbs and cognitive verbs.
- Provide recommendations to reduce misleading anthropomorphism in AI discourse and discuss other potential applications of AnthroScore.

In summary, the key innovation is an automatic, lexicon-free metric called AnthroScore to quantify the degree of anthropomorphism towards non-human entities like AI systems. This enables analyzing anthropomorphism at scale to uncover concerning trends of increasingly human-like framing of technology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The authors introduce AnthroScore, an automatic metric that quantifies the degree of anthropomorphism (attribution of human characteristics) for non-human entities in text; they analyze trends in anthropomorphism over time across computer science papers and in news coverage, finding increases in research papers (especially for language models) and higher levels in news headlines compared to cited papers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing AnthroScore (\panthr), an automatic metric to measure the degree of anthropomorphism (attribution of human-like characteristics to non-human entities) in text. The key components of the contribution are:

1) Proposing a computational method to quantify anthropomorphism by using a masked language model to compare how much a non-human entity is implicitly framed as human versus non-human in the surrounding context. 

2) Validating the metric by showing it correlates with human judgments of anthropomorphism and dimensions of anthropomorphism from psychology literature.

3) Applying the metric to analyze trends of anthropomorphism over time and across different areas of research by measuring it in hundreds of thousands of academic paper abstracts and downstream news articles. Key findings are that anthropomorphism is increasing over time, especially in language model and ACL papers, and news headlines contain higher anthropomorphism compared to paper abstracts.

4) Discussing implications of observed anthropomorphism trends, causes underlying anthropomorphic language, and providing recommendations to minimize potentially misleading anthropomorphism in AI/NLP discourse.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and validating an automatic, scalable method to quantify anthropomorphism in text, and using this method for large-scale analysis to uncover concerning trends of anthropomorphism in AI/NLP research and media.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Anthropomorphism: The attribution of human-like characteristics, abilities, emotions, etc. to non-human entities. This is the main concept that the paper focuses on quantifying and analyzing.

- AnthroScore (A): The proposed computational linguistic metric to measure the degree of anthropomorphism in text. 

- Language models (LMs): Neural network models trained on large amounts of text data that are a major focus of analysis in terms of anthropomorphism. Specific LMs mentioned include BERT, GPT, GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.

- Technical artifacts: Non-human, man-made entities that are studied and discussed in academic papers, such as algorithms, systems, models, networks, etc. The anthropomorphism of these entities is a key part of the analysis.

- Abstracts, headlines: The paper analyzes trends in anthropomorphism in both the abstracts of academic papers and news headlines about those papers. 

- Social science literature: The paper grounds the concept of anthropomorphism in previous social science research on the topic.

- Misleading metaphors, misinformation: The paper discusses concerns about harms resulting from anthropomorphic misconceptions and metaphors about technology.

Some other potentially relevant terms include masked language models, human evaluations, disciplinary norms, reporting verbs, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes measuring anthropomorphism using probabilities from a masked language model. What are some potential disadvantages or limitations of relying solely on a language model for this task? For example, could the language model itself contain anthropomorphic biases that could impact the scores?

2. When computing P_human and P_nonhuman, the paper only uses a small set of human and non-human pronouns. How might the choice of pronouns impact the final anthropomorphism scores? Could expanding this list provide more nuanced scores? 

3. The paper demonstrates correlation between the proposed computational measure and human judgments of anthropomorphism. However, the human annotations were done by only two expert annotators. How could the annotation process be expanded to further validate the computational measure?

4. The paper finds interesting differences in anthropomorphism across academic fields and article types. What other text genres could be analyzed using this method to provide additional insights? For example, analyzing anthropomorphism in dialogues or social media posts?

5. How well does the measure generalize to languages other than English? What modifications would need to be made to compute anthropomorphism scores for non-English text?

6. The paper focuses on analyzing anthropomorphism of technical artifacts and language models. What other entities could be the target of analysis using this method? For example, diseases, animals, or brands?

7. The measure relies on parsing sentences and extracting entities using Spacy. How robust is the measure to errors in the parsing and entity extraction steps? 

8. What other computational linguistics methods could be incorporated to provide deeper analysis? For example, sentiment analysis or metaphor identification?

9. The paper analyzes trends over time, but does not dive deeper into causal explanations. What follow-up studies could aim to better understand the underlying reasons for increased anthropomorphism? 

10. The paper provides individual and community recommendations for reducing misleading anthropomorphism. How can the impact and adoption of these recommendations be evaluated over time? What other interventions could help address this issue?
