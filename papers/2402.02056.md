# [AnthroScore: A Computational Linguistic Measure of Anthropomorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02056)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Anthropomorphism (attributing human-like qualities to non-human entities) of technology like AI systems can lead to misleading narratives and overstated capabilities. However, there are currently no computational methods to quantify anthropomorphism. 

Proposed Solution - AnthroScore:
- The authors propose AnthroScore, a metric that compares how likely an entity is to be implicitly framed as human versus non-human in the surrounding textual context, using a masked language model.

- AnthroScore is calculated by masking mentions of non-human entities in sentences, getting probability distributions over replacing the mask with human vs non-human pronouns from a language model, and taking the log odds ratio.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate AnthroScore correlates with human judgments of anthropomorphism.
- Use AnthroScore to analyze 15 years of CS/AI papers and news articles. Find anthropomorphism is increasing over time, especially in ACL papers, and is higher in news than papers.
- Analyze linguistic factors related to anthropomorphism like reporting verbs and cognitive verbs.
- Provide recommendations to reduce misleading anthropomorphism in AI discourse and discuss other potential applications of AnthroScore.

In summary, the key innovation is an automatic, lexicon-free metric called AnthroScore to quantify the degree of anthropomorphism towards non-human entities like AI systems. This enables analyzing anthropomorphism at scale to uncover concerning trends of increasingly human-like framing of technology.
