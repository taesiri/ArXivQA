## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Food image recognition struggles to effectively distinguish between visually similar food samples, a key challenge in fine-grained food recognition. Issues like complex spatial relationships and long-tailed data distributions also impede reliability of feature extraction methods.

Proposed Solution:
- A Gaussian and Causal-Attention Model (GCAM) for fine-grained food recognition. It has two main components:
1) Feature Gaussian Fusion (FGF): Learns a Gaussian distribution map of object locations to guide feature extraction and reduce influence of backgrounds. 
2) Causal Reasoning Attention (CRA): Constructs a causal graph to quantify impact of factual and counterfactual attention maps to improve attention quality and reduce data bias. 

Main Contributions:
- Introduce FGF module to model Gaussian distribution of spatial object regions for better feature extraction.
- Employ causal graphs and compare factual and counterfactual scenarios to refine attention mechanism quality. 
- Design a Loss Learning Strategy to balance stability across modules and improve accuracy.

- Show state-of-the-art performance on Vireo-FOOD172, UECFOOD256 and ETH-FOOD101 datasets, validating effectiveness. Also achieved competitive accuracy on CUB-200 fine-grained dataset, indicating wide applicability.

In summary, GCAM proposes targeted solutions to address key fine-grained recognition challenges like complex relationships and data distributions. The causal attention and dynamic loss balancing allow it to reliably focus on discriminative object details. Superior empirical performance validate the strong capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Gaussian and causal-attention model for fine-grained food recognition that models the Gaussian distribution of food images, improves attention quality through counterfactual reasoning, and uses a loss learning strategy to balance training stability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. Proposing a novel network called Gaussian and Causal-Attention Model (GCAM) for food recognition. The key aspects of this model are:

- Using a Feature Gaussian Fusion (FGF) module to model the Gaussian distribution of object spatial regions in the image. This helps mitigate the influence of background elements during feature extraction.

- Employing a causal graph model and counterfactual reasoning to optimize the attention maps. This reduces the bias from the training data and helps the network learn more useful attention weights for fine-grained recognition. 

- Designing a Learnable Loss Strategy (LLS) to balance training stability across the various modules and improve overall accuracy.

2. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on several food recognition datasets - Vireo-FOOD172, FOOD256, and Food-101.

3. Validating the network's effectiveness on other fine-grained datasets by testing on CUB-200 and achieving competitive performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the GCAM network architecture and its components like FGF, CRA, and LLS that together enable superior fine-grained food recognition performance. The effectiveness of GCAM is demonstrated through state-of-the-art or competitive results on multiple benchmarks.
