# [An Empirical Study of Speech Language Models for Prompt-Conditioned   Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Speech language models (LMs) show promise for high-quality speech synthesis through in-context learning. They take semantic units as content and a short utterance as prompt to synthesize speech that preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. 
- However, there is no systematic understanding of how the synthesized audio is controlled by the prompt and content. Key questions remain unanswered:
    - How do heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts affect the synthesized audio quality? 
    - Will acoustic information in content units leak to the synthesized speech?
    - How do prompt and content control acoustic features like pitch, speech rate, volume and emphasis?

Proposed Solution and Contributions:
- Conduct an empirical study of autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs on conditional speech synthesis.
- Key findings:
    - Heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt audio quality, contrary to longer prompts always leading to better synthesis.  
    - Content speaker style also affects synthesized vocal style through semantic units, indicating they carry unexpected acoustic information.
    - Semantic units embed rich acoustic details like pitch, tempo, volume and emphasis that may leak to the synthesized speech.
- These findings reveal contemporary speech LMs' limitations in achieving controllable speech synthesis solely through prompts.
- Provide insights into prompt design, content unit information and true capabilities of speech LMs. 
- Release code for reproducibility and future benchmarking.

In summary, this paper presents the first systematic investigation into how prompt and content affect conditional speech synthesis in state-of-the-art speech LMs. The empirical study reveals existing limitations of speech LMs in achieving disentangled control of style and content for speech generation. The findings offer valuable guidance for developing better speech representations and modeling techniques to advance speech LMs.
