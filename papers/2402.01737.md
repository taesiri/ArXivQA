# [Assistive Large Language Model Agents for Socially-Aware Negotiation   Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Negotiations are an integral part of everyday life, but social norm violations can damage relationships and trust, leading to failed negotiations. 
- There is a need for automated systems that can detect and mitigate social norm violations in negotiations to improve outcomes.
- However, there is no training data available for this novel task.

Proposed Solution:
- Simulate negotiations between two LLM agent negotiators, injecting controlled social norm violations.
- Introduce a third LLM agent as a "remediator" to rewrite violating utterances to adhere to social norms before exposing them to the other negotiator. 
- Propose a novel in-context learning (ICL) method to select effective training examples for the remediator based on a "value impact" score that measures negotiation outcomes. This connects the method to policy learning.
- Use Monte Carlo tree search with value impact to select an optimal set of ICL examples.

Experiments and Results:
- Test proposed method on negotiations across 3 topics: product sale, housing price, salary. 
- The remediator models significantly improve outcomes by mitigating violations for both fine-tuned and untuned LLMs.
- The ICL method outperforms competitive baselines on all metrics, especially when using ChatGPT.
- Analyze the quality and diversity of selected ICL examples.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel assistive remediator system and simulation method to improve negotiation outcomes
- ICL selection method based on "value impact" tied to policy learning 
- Extensive experiments demonstrating efficacy across metrics and topics
- Analysis providing insights into properties of effective ICL examples

The paper makes good progress towards building automated systems that can mitigate social norm violations in negotiations. The ICL selection method is a key contribution for improving LLM assistance without access to labeled training data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using large language models as assistive agents to mitigate social norm violations in negotiations between two LLM-based negotiating agents, in order to improve negotiation outcomes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method to select high-quality in-context learning (ICL) examples for large language model (LLM) based remediation agents to mitigate social norm violations in negotiations. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Introducing a multi-agent setting with two LLM negotiator agents and an LLM remediation agent to simulate real-world negotiations. Social norm violations are injected to study the impact of remediations.

2) Proposing a value impact function to measure the quality of ICL examples based on the improvement in negotiation outcomes. This connects ICL example selection to policy learning.

3) Developing an optimization algorithm that starts with top ranked ICL candidates and then randomly swaps examples to maximize value impact until convergence.

4) Conducting extensive experiments on three negotiation topics and showing the proposed ICL selection method outperforms competitive baselines across various metrics.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and empirical contributions in using LLMs for assistive negotiation dialogues by selecting high-quality ICL examples based on negotiation outcomes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper explores using LLMs to build social norm remediation agents to assist in negotiations.

- Multi-agent setting: The paper simulates negotiations by having two LLM agents play negotiator roles and a third LLM act as a remediation agent.  

- Social norm violations: The paper focuses on detecting and intervening to mitigate utterances from negotiators that violate social norms, which can harm negotiations.

- Remediation agent: A key concept is the LLM-based remediation agent that suggests edits to norm-violating utterances before they reach the other negotiator.  

- In-context learning (ICL): With no training data available, the paper introduces a value impact based ICL method to select effective demonstration examples to prompt the remediation agent.

- Value impact: A key term referring to a scoring function used to measure negotiation outcomes in order to identify high-quality ICL examples for training remediation agents.

- Policy learning: The paper makes a connection between the ICL example selection method and policy learning in reinforcement learning.

- Task goals and relational goals: The negotiation agents have both task goals like maximizing price as well as relational goals like building trust and cooperation.  

So in summary, key concepts involve using LLMs and multi-agent simulation for negotiation, detecting/remediating norm violations, selecting ICL examples based on value impact, and balancing task versus relational goals.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a value impact function to measure the quality of negotiation outcomes. How exactly is this value impact function defined and calculated? What are the key factors and metrics it takes into account?

2. The paper introduces a Monte Carlo sampling based approach to select optimal ICL examples. Can you explain in more detail the tree structure it assumes over possible remediated dialogues and how sampling is performed in this tree? 

3. The initial set of ICL examples starts with the top k examples based on value impact. What is the intuition behind this heuristic? How sensitive is the final set of ICL examples to this initial set?

4. The paper proposes a swap-based local search to improve the ICL set. Why is a simple hill climbing approach not employed and how does the random swap avoid getting stuck in local optima?

5. How does the paper address the high computational complexity in estimating value impacts of individual ICL examples? What approximations are made and what is their impact on solution quality?

6. The negotiation process involves both task goals and relational goals. How does the value impact function balance and tradeoff between these two types of goals?

7. The remediations can significantly alter the course of a negotiation dialogue. Does the value estimation process somehow account for this cascading impact of remediations over multiple turns?

8. The paper demonstrates superiority over nearest neighbour based approaches. What specific limitations of similarity based retrieval does the proposed approach address?

9. Can the proposed ICL selection approach be extended to other dialogue based tasks beyond negotiations? What components are transferable and what enhancements may be needed?

10. The empirical results seem to suggest ICL based approaches outperform supervised fine-tuning. What reasons drive this performance gap and how can it be narrowed?
