# [Boximator: Generating Rich and Controllable Motions for Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Boximator: Generating Rich and Controllable Motions for Video Synthesis":

Problem:
- Generating controllable and realistic video motions is a key challenge in video synthesis. 
- Existing models lack fine-grained control over object motions and camera movements. 
- Constraints like sketches, poses, trajectories have limitations in selecting/controlling objects.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "Boximator", a new approach for motion control using box-shaped constraints. 
- Two types of boxes: "hard box" precisely delineates an object, "soft box" defines a region where the object should reside.
- Boxes are associated with unique object IDs and tracked across frames.
- Works by adding a control module to existing video diffusion models while freezing base model weights.
- Addresses training challenges via a "self-tracking" technique - trains model to generate bounding boxes tracking objects.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art video quality while enabling precise motion control.
- Box constraints allow easy selection/control of objects without extra text.
- Soft boxes enable approximate control in frames lacking user boxes.  
- Self-tracking simplifies learning of box-object correlations from visual inputs.
- Experiments show robust motion controllability via improved bounding box alignment metric and user preference.
- Ablations validate benefits of soft boxes and self-tracking.
- Generalizable approach adaptable to other conditional inputs like poses, keypoints.

In summary, Boximator introduces an intuitive box-based mechanism for controlling object motions in video synthesis while achieving strong quantitative and qualitative results. The self-tracking training technique is a key innovation enabling the model to learn visual grounding of boxes.
