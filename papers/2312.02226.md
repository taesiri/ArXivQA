# [Generating Action-conditioned Prompts for Open-vocabulary Video Action   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for open-vocabulary video action recognition rely on adapting pretrained image-text models like CLIP to the video domain by integrating temporal modeling. However, they use basic, less informative action descriptions as prompts, which causes them to struggle at recognizing novel, unseen actions. The paper argues that to achieve human-like ability of recognizing novel actions, models need to augment text embeddings with human prior knowledge just like humans rely on auxiliary knowledge of scenes, elements, props etc. to identify new actions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes to blend video models with large language models (LLMs) to generate "Action-conditioned Prompts" that incorporate human knowledge to aid open-vocabulary video action recognition. Specifically:

1) It systematically identifies 12 attributes covering scene, actor and body-related aspects that are critical for distinguishing actions. 

2) It utilizes GPT-4 to generate descriptive sentences for each attribute to create knowledge-rich, multi-attribute prompts tailored to each action.

3) It introduces a Multi-modal Action Knowledge Alignment (MAKA) mechanism to align concepts between video and knowledge embedded in the prompts via late interaction between frame and prompt embeddings.

Main Contributions:

- Innovatively combines video models and LLMs to produce Action-conditioned Prompts that equip models with human prior knowledge to enhance open-vocabulary video action recognition.

- Introduces a systematic way to identify critical attributes and generate tailored action prompts using LLMs to provide rich auxiliary knowledge.

- Proposes a MAKA method to establish fine-grained alignment between video concepts and knowledge in prompts.

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in various settings like zero-shot, few-shot etc. across multiple datasets, proving effectiveness.

- Visualizations also demonstrate interpretability by revealing how models utilize knowledge to discern actions.

The paper presents a novel direction of utilizing knowledge-based prompting to push state-of-the-art in open-vocabulary video understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a method to enhance open-vocabulary video action recognition by blending video models with large language models to generate action-conditioned prompts that provide knowledge-rich textual descriptions of actions, and aligning these prompts with visual concepts in videos using a multi-modal knowledge alignment mechanism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to generate "Action-conditioned Prompts" for open-vocabulary video action recognition. Specifically:

- They propose to blend video models with large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptive and knowledge-rich prompts about actions, called "Action-conditioned Prompts". These prompts provide auxiliary knowledge about actions to aid recognition, especially for novel, unseen actions.

- They introduce a hierarchical prompt generation strategy, first identifying critical attributes for actions, then using LLMs to generate sentences describing each action in terms of those attributes. This results in multi-attribute prompts from various perspectives.

- They propose a "Multi-modal Action Knowledge Alignment" method to align the knowledge in the generated textual prompts with visual concepts in video frames, to enable fine-grained video-text matching. 

- Extensive experiments show their method sets new state-of-the-art on multiple video action recognition benchmarks, especially for generalizing to novel categories. The method also demonstrates good interpretability by visualizing frame-prompt alignments.

In summary, the key contribution is using LLMs to generate informative, multi-attribute prompts tailored to actions, and aligning this knowledge with videos, to significantly improve open-vocabulary video action recognition.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Open-vocabulary video action recognition - The paper focuses on recognizing novel, previously unseen video actions without having explicit examples during training. This is also referred to as zero-shot or open-vocabulary action recognition.

- Action-conditioned prompts - A key contribution of the paper is generating descriptive prompts for each action that encapsulate distinctive attributes and auxiliary knowledge. These prompts, termed action-conditioned prompts, augment the text embeddings to enhance recognition.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper leverages large pre-trained language models like GPT-4 to generate the tailored action prompts in a hierarchical manner, drawing on the knowledge within LLMs.

- Multi-modal action knowledge alignment - An alignment mechanism proposed to establish fine-grained correspondences between visual concepts in videos and knowledge captured in the action-conditioned prompts. 

- Generalization - A major focus of the paper is improving the generalization ability of models to recognize novel unseen actions during inference across different datasets and settings.

- Interpretability - The approach also demonstrates stronger interpretability by revealing how the model perceives actions through visual and textual cue alignment.

In summary, the key themes are leveraging knowledge and prompts from LLMs, establishing cross-modal alignment, and enhancing open-vocabulary generalization and interpretability for video action recognition.
