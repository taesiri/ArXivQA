# [Extending Interactive Science Exhibits into the Classroom using   Anthropomorphized Chatbots and Bloom's Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- High school and middle school students benefit from hands-on science exhibits at museums, but in-person visits can be limited by barriers like cost and accessibility. Virtual exhibits could expand reach, but need to find ways to engage students.

Proposed Solution:
- Use AI-powered chatbots as virtual exhibits, designing them in two key ways:
   1) Give them an anthropomorphic design - have them speak in the first person as if they are the exhibit, with a quirky personality.
   2) Generate questions using Bloom's Taxonomy to assess and encourage learning.
   
- Test feasibility of the ideas using the latest generative AI (GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT).

Main Contributions:

- Showed it is possible to easily create chatbots that act as virtual exhibits with anthropomorphic design features using prompt engineering alone. The chatbots can speak from the perspective of the exhibit (a comet) with an assigned personality (the humor of Willy Wonka).

- Demonstrated Generative AI can generate contextual questions aligned with lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (understanding, remembering) to encourage science learning through the chatbot interaction.

- Established a foundation for future classroom evaluation of such chatbots as virtual exhibits, potentially increasing accessibility of hands-on science engagement.

- Discussed possible extensions like combining with physical field trips, using ideas like gamification to further boost student motivation, and evaluating the approach for enhancing inclusion of marginalized groups.

The paper shows the promise of leveraging the latest AI to make science exhibits more engaging and available beyond physical museum spaces.
