# [BayLing: Bridging Cross-lingual Alignment and Instruction Following   through Interactive Translation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we transfer the capabilities of language generation and instruction following from English to other languages for large language models (LLMs) in an efficient way that minimizes human effort?More specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:1) Introducing interactive translation instructions can enhance the generation capabilities of non-English languages involved in the interactive translation task, without negatively impacting the generation capabilities of the English language.2) Introducing interactive translation instructions can assist LLMs in comprehending human intent and accurately following user instructions. 3) Interactive translation instructions can refine the translation for both single-turn and multi-turn interactive translation across the languages included in the interactive translation.4) Interactive translation instructions can improve the performance on general tasks for the languages incorporated in interactive translation tasks.The researchers propose using interactive translation tasks to achieve cross-lingual alignment and instruction following simultaneously in an efficient way, thereby transferring capabilities from English to other languages with minimal human effort. The experiments and results aim to validate these hypotheses.In summary, the central research question involves finding an efficient way to transfer key LLM capabilities to multiple languages through interactive translation instructions. The key hypotheses focus on how this approach can enhance multilingual generation, instruction following, translation, and performance on general tasks.
