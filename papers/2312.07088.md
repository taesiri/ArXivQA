# [BED: Bi-Encoder-Decoder Model for Canonical Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07088)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called BED (Bi-Encoder-Decoder) for canonical relation extraction, which aims to extract relational triples from sentences by mapping the elements to a knowledge base. BED employs an encoder to represent semantics of entity information, generating high-quality representations for entities. This helps fully utilize entity information compared to prior encoder-decoder methods which struggle to obtain good entity embeddings. Additionally, BED can easily represent novel entities given the trained entity encoder, without needing to retrain the model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that BED significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both overall performance and handling novel entities. The model also reduces parameters and speeds up inference. In summary, by adopting a separate entity encoder, BED advances the encoder-decoder architecture for canonical relation extraction and handles key limitations around modeling entities.
