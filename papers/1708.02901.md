# [Transitive Invariance for Self-supervised Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02901)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How can we learn visual representations with both inter-instance invariance (different instances should have similar features) and intra-instance invariance (to variations like viewpoint, pose, etc. of the same instance) in a completely self-supervised manner without any human annotations?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes a method to construct a graph with two types of edges - inter-instance edges between different instances and intra-instance edges between different views of the same instance. 

- Apply transitive relations on this graph to obtain richer image pairs exhibiting complex invariance. 

- Train a siamese network with a ranking loss using image pairs from the graph to learninvariant representations.

- Achieve 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 07 detection using Fast R-CNN, competitive with 67.3% using ImageNet pretraining.

- Achieve 23.5% AP on COCO using Faster R-CNN, closest reported accuracy compared to 24.4% with ImageNet pretraining.

- Outperform ImageNet pretraining on surface normal estimation task on NYUv2.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that combining two types of invariance via transitive relations can help learn rich self-supervised representations for various vision tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a method for self-supervised visual representation learning by exploiting different types of invariance and applying transitive relations on them. The main contributions are:

- They construct a graph with two types of edges - "inter-instance" edges that connect different instances with similar appearance, and "intra-instance" edges that connect different views of the same instance. 

- They generate new invariant relationships between images by applying transitivity on this graph. For example, if image A and B have an inter-instance edge, and A and A' have an intra-instance edge, then by transitivity A' and B can be considered invariant.

- They use these transitive invariant pairs to train a triplet siamese network to learn invariant representations. The network is trained on image pairs that are transitively invariant and dissimilar to a third distractor image.

- Their method achieves 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection using Fast R-CNN, which is the closest performance to ImageNet supervised pre-training (67.3% mAP) using self-supervision.

- They also report competitive results (23.5% AP) on the challenging COCO dataset using Faster R-CNN, again very close to ImageNet supervised pretraining (24.4% AP).

So in summary, the key contribution is a way to generate richer invariant relationships from different self-supervised approaches via transitivity, and use it to learn visually invariant representations without manual supervision. The representations transfer well to object detection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in self-supervised visual representation learning:

- It proposes a novel method of combining intra-instance invariance (tracking objects in videos) and inter-instance invariance (context prediction on still images) to obtain richer invariance. Many prior works focus on just one of these sources. The combination is done not via multi-task learning but by reasoning about transitive relations on a graph.

- The paper presents extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on PASCAL VOC object detection using both Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN frameworks. It achieves 63.2% and 65.0% mAP respectively on VOC 2007, outperforming prior self-supervised methods by a large margin and getting fairly close to supervised ImageNet pretraining.

- This is the first work to report results with a self-supervised pre-trained model on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. The achieved 23.5% AP is very close (within 1%) to ImageNet pretraining, which is a significant result.

- In addition to object detection, the paper also shows strong performance on surface normal estimation, significantly outperforming ImageNet pretraining. This suggests the learned features capture different invariances useful for different tasks. 

- Compared to concurrent self-supervised works, this paper presents a unique approach of combining multiple self-supervision losses via graph-based reasoning. The achieved performance onVOC and COCO object detection surpasses other methods from that time by a large gap.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions through its novel transitive approach, extensive analysis, strong detection results competitive with ImageNet pretraining, and generalization to other tasks like surface normal estimation. It demonstrates the importance of learning rich invariance in representations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different ways to construct the graph and define the edges for capturing inter-instance and intra-instance invariance. The authors used context prediction and visual tracking in videos, but other self-supervised approaches could be investigated.

- Applying the graph construction and transitive reasoning approach to other self-supervised learning methods beyond context prediction and tracking. The framework is generic and could be combined with other pretext tasks.

- Evaluating the learned representations on a wider range of downstream tasks beyond object detection and surface normal estimation. Testing on other tasks like segmentation, classification, etc could reveal more insights.

- Exploring variations of the triplet loss and network architecture. The Triplet-Siamese framework proved effective but other network designs could be experimented with.

- Applying the method to learn representations from video data beyond the YouTube videos used in the paper. Other large-scale video datasets could provide different styles of invariance.

- Investigating whether combining with generative models like GANs or VAEs could improve the learned representations. The clustering performed could potentially be enhanced.

- Studying whether and how well the representations transfer to more complex recognition tasks like action recognition in videos. New invariance specific to videos could emerge.

- Evaluating the impact of different hyperparameters like the number of clusters, margin value, etc on the quality of representations. Ablations could reveal optimal settings.

In summary, the authors point to further exploring variations of the graph construction, expanding the tasks and datasets, modifying the networks, and testing on more applications as interesting future directions to build on this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to learn visual representations using self-supervised learning, exploiting both inter-instance and intra-instance invariance. The authors construct a graph with millions of object nodes from videos, with two types of edges: inter-instance edges that connect different instances of similar appearance, and intra-instance edges that connect an object to itself under different viewpoints from tracking. By applying transitivity on this graph, they obtain richer implicit relationships between objects exhibiting greater visual invariance. They use this data to train a Triplet-Siamese ConvNet with a ranking loss to embed images with similar high-level semantics nearby and dissimilar ones far apart in the feature space. Without any human annotations, representations learned by their method transfer surprisingly well to object detection, achieving 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 with Fast R-CNN and 23.5% AP on the challenging COCO dataset with Faster R-CNN. Their self-supervised model also outperforms ImageNet pre-training on surface normal estimation. This demonstrates the promise of organizing relationships in data for representation learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to learn visual representations with self-supervised learning that are invariant to both inter-instance variations (two objects in the same class should have similar features) and intra-instance variations (viewpoint, pose, deformations, illumination, etc). Instead of combining multiple self-supervised tasks with multi-task learning, the authors generate a graph with millions of object nodes mined from videos. The nodes are connected by two types of edges - "different instances but similar viewpoint/category" and "different viewpoints of the same instance". By applying transitivity on this graph, they obtain richer visual invariance from the data. 

They train a Triplet-Siamese network with a ranking loss using image pairs from the graph to encourage similarity between related images and dissimilarity from random images. The learned representations are evaluated on object detection and surface normal estimation. They achieve 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection using Fast R-CNN, close to the supervised ImageNet pre-training result. More impressively, they report the first results on COCO using unsupervised pre-training, achieving 23.5% AP with Faster R-CNN compared to 24.4% with ImageNet pre-training. For surface normal estimation, their method outperforms ImageNet pre-training by 3-4% in most metrics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised approach to learn visual representations that exhibit both inter-instance and intra-instance invariance. The key idea is to construct a graph with two types of edges - inter-instance edges that link different instances of similar objects, and intra-instance edges that link different views of the same object instance. The inter-instance edges are obtained by clustering image patches based on features learned from context prediction. The intra-instance edges come from tracking objects in videos. By applying transitivity to this graph, the method relates images with varying levels of visual invariance. A Triplet-Siamese ConvNet with a ranking loss is then trained on image triplets sampled from the graph to encourage invariance. This allows the model to learn rich representations from unlabeled videos and images, without manual annotations. The learned features transfer well to object detection, achieving surprisingly close accuracy on PASCAL VOC and COCO compared to supervised pre-training on ImageNet classification.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a method for self-supervised visual representation learning, with the goal of learning features that are invariant to inter-instance variations (different objects of the same class should have similar features) and intra-instance variations (different views/poses of the same object should have similar features). 

- Most prior self-supervised methods learn either inter-instance or intra-instance invariance, but not both. The paper argues that combining the two objectives via multi-task learning does not work well. 

- Instead, the paper constructs a graph with two types of edges - inter-instance edges between different objects of similar appearance, and intra-instance edges between views of the same object. 

- By applying transitivity on this graph, the method can obtain new training pairs exhibiting richer invariance, e.g. relating different objects in different views.

- A Siamese network with a triplet ranking loss is then trained on image pairs sampled from the graph to learn invariant representations.

- Experiments show the learned features transfer well to object detection, achieving 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 with Fast R-CNN, close to the fully supervised ImageNet pre-training result.

- They also report COCO detection results for the first time using an unsupervised pre-training method, obtaining 23.5% AP with Faster R-CNN, very close to ImageNet supervised pre-training.

In summary, the key idea is to use graph transitivity to obtain richer invariance from combining inter-instance and intra-instance objectives, rather than naively combining losses. The learned features transfer surprisingly well to object detection compared to prior self-supervised methods.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning method to obtain visual representations invariant to both inter-instance variations (different objects of the same class) and intra-instance variations (viewpoint, pose, etc. changes of the same object). The key idea is to construct a graph with two types of edges - inter-instance edges connecting different objects of similar appearance, and intra-instance edges connecting different views of the same object instance. The inter-instance edges are obtained by clustering image patches based on learned features that capture commonalities. The intra-instance edges come from unsupervised tracking of objects in videos. By applying transitivity on this graph, more complex invariance can be obtained from simple relations. The enriched invariant relations are used to train a Triplet-Siamese ConvNet with a ranking loss. Without using any annotations, the learned representations achieve 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC detection using Fast R-CNN, compared to 67.3% with ImageNet pretraining. More impressively, fine-tuning Faster R-CNN on COCO gives 23.5% AP, which is very close to the ImageNet-supervised counterpart (24.4% AP). The representations also outperform ImageNet pretraining on surface normal estimation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of exploiting different types of self-supervised signals and transitively relating them to obtain richer invariance for representation learning.
