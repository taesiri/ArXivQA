## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new benchmark called SEED-Bench for evaluating the generative comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Several other concurrent works have also proposed benchmarks for MLLMs, but SEED-Bench is distinct in several ways:

- Scale: With 19K multiple choice questions, SEED-Bench is much larger than existing benchmarks like MME (2194 questions) and MMBench (2974 questions). The larger scale provides more stable evaluation statistics.

- Objectivity: SEED-Bench uses multiple choice questions with human-verified ground truth answers. This enables objective evaluation without relying on human judgment or GPT like some other benchmarks. 

- Coverage: SEED-Bench spans 12 evaluation dimensions covering both spatial and temporal understanding. Other benchmarks tend to focus on fewer abilities. The comprehensive coverage allows more in-depth assessment.

- The paper evaluates 18 MLLMs on SEED-Bench, providing one of the most extensive comparisons of MLLMs to date. Other benchmarking works have evaluated fewer models - MME benchmarked 10 and MMBench 14.

- The analysis of results on SEED-Bench provides unique insights into current MLLM capabilities and limitations, revealing issues like poor performance on fine-grained temporal reasoning. This showcases the value of the benchmark for motivating future research directions.

Overall, the large-scale, objective, and comprehensive nature of SEED-Bench combined with the extensive model evaluation differentiates this work from prior MLLM benchmarking research and offers significant contributions. The benchmark and analysis provide a strong foundation for continued investigation of MLLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Developing more advanced multimodal models that can overcome the limitations revealed through the evaluation results on SEED-Bench. The paper shows most existing models still exhibit limited performance across the 12 evaluation dimensions, indicating significant room for improvement.

- Enhancing models' capabilities for fine-grained temporal understanding and reasoning, as most models performed poorly on action recognition, prediction and procedure understanding. The authors suggest developing models with stronger abilities to capture temporal dynamics and perform temporal reasoning.

- Improving models' understanding of spatial relationships between objects, as top models struggled on this despite excelling at instance localization. The recognition of spatial relationships requires handling greater variability and ambiguity.

- Equipping models to better handle text recognition in images by pre-training them on datasets containing more textual elements. Most models showed poor text recognition abilities.

- Expanding the scope of video pre-training and instruction tuning for VideoLLMs to improve their temporal understanding, as they failed to demonstrate a clear advantage over ImageLLMs.

- Continuing to expand SEED-Bench with more data across additional evaluation dimensions and domains. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive benchmark and plan to consistently maintain and expand it.

- Launching a platform and leaderboard for the research community to evaluate latest models using SEED-Bench. This can motivate development of more advanced models.

In summary, the key suggestions are to utilize SEED-Bench's insights to develop stronger multimodal models, expand the scope and scale of the benchmark itself, and provide an evaluation platform to drive further progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces SEED-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating the generative comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple choice questions with human-annotated answers across 12 evaluation dimensions covering both spatial and temporal understanding. The authors develop a pipeline to generate high-quality multiple choice questions targeting specific abilities like scene understanding and action recognition. After extracting visual information from images and videos, they use ChatGPT/GPT-4 to create questions and answer choices. The questions are filtered to remove ones answerable without visuals and verified by humans. Using this benchmark, 18 MLLMs are evaluated including image, video, and text-only models. The results reveal most models still exhibit limited performance, with InstructBLIP achieving top accuracy on 8 dimensions. Surprisingly, video LLMs do not show significant gains on temporal tasks over image LLMs. By benchmarking models, the authors aim to motivate research into more advanced MLLMs with truly multimodal understanding and reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces SEED-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating the generative comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple-choice questions with human-annotated answers, spanning 12 evaluation dimensions covering both spatial and temporal understanding across images and videos. This is much larger in scale compared to prior MLLM benchmarks. The authors develop an automated pipeline to generate high-quality multiple-choice questions targeting specific comprehension skills, using visual information extracted by foundation models and question/answer generation by ChatGPT/GPT-4. The questions are filtered to remove ones answerable without visual inputs, and verified by human annotators. 

SEED-Bench is used to evaluate 18 MLLMs, including image-only, video-only, and combined models. The results reveal most models still exhibit limited performance on the comprehensive set of comprehension skills tested. InstructBLIP performs the best overall, topping 8 of 12 dimensions. However, it has difficulty generalizing to out-of-distribution data like fine-grained action recognition. Surprisingly, video-only models do not show significant advantages on temporal understanding compared to image-only models. Through its rigorous, objective methodology and extensive set of evaluation dimensions, SEED-Bench enables thorough assessment of MLLM capabilities, provides insights to guide future research towards more advanced MLLMs, and serves as a platform to benchmark model progress.

The paper introduces a new benchmark called SEED-Bench for evaluating the generative comprehension capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark consists of 19K multiple choice questions spanning 12 evaluation dimensions covering both spatial and temporal understanding. The authors develop a sophisticated pipeline to generate the benchmark data. They first extract rich visual information from images and videos using various foundation models. Then they feed this information to ChatGPT/GPT-4 to generate questions and 4 answer choices, with one being the groundtruth. They filter out questions answerable without visuals and have humans annotate the correct choice and categorize the questions. This results in accurate, multi-dimensional benchmark data. To evaluate MLLMs, they compute likelihood scores for each choice given the question and select the choice with maximum likelihood as the model's prediction, without relying on instruction following. They test 18 MLLMs encompassing LLMs, ImageLLMs and VideoLLMs over all dimensions to comprehensively assess capabilities.
