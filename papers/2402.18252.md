# [Towards Generalist Prompting for Large Language Models by Mental Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Generalist Prompting for Large Language Models by Mental Models":

Problem:
- Existing prompting methods for large language models (LLMs) either rely on task-specific examples requiring domain knowledge, or are simple but only work well on limited tasks. There is a need for a generalist prompting method that achieves strong performance across diverse tasks without manual selection of prompts.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces the concept of "generalist prompting" - optimal or near-optimal performance across tasks without manual prompt tuning.
- The paper proposes MeMo (Mental Models), an innovative prompting method fulfilling generalist prompting criteria. 
- MeMo introduces the concept of "mental models" to LLMs - cognitive structures for problem-solving and decision-making. 
- MeMo provides a definition and examples of mental models to LLMs.
- In downstream tasks, LLMs are guided to select suitable mental models themselves based on the problem context.

Main Contributions:
- Proposition of the novel concept of generalist prompting for LLMs.
- Design of MeMo, an effective generalist prompting method using mental models. 
- MeMo matches or approaches state-of-the-art performance across diverse logical reasoning, STEM, and commonsense reasoning tasks.
- MeMo eliminates need for manual selection/tuning of prompts for different tasks. 
- Analysis reveals LLMs' nuanced understanding and appropriate selection of mental models.
- Exploration of MeMo advances research towards truly generalist prompting paradigms.

In summary, the paper introduces generalist prompting and proposes MeMo as an innovative implementation leveraging mental models to make prompting more versatile across tasks while requiring less human effort in prompt engineering. Evaluations demonstrate MeMo's effectiveness as a generalist prompting technique for enhanced LLM performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MeMo, a novel generalist prompting method that enables large language models to autonomously select and apply suitable mental models for problem-solving across diverse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance without task-specific customization of prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MeMo (Mental Models), a novel prompting method for large language models (LLMs) that aims to fulfill the criteria of a generalist prompting method. 

Specifically, MeMo:

- Introduces the concept of "generalist prompting", which aims to achieve optimal or near-optimal performance on a wide range of tasks while eliminating the need for manual selection and customization of prompts tailored to specific problems.

- Leverages the concept of "mental models" to distill the cores of various existing prompting methods into individual models that can be applied flexibly across problems. 

- Enables LLMs to autonomously select and apply suitable mental models for a given problem through prompt engineering, without requiring human intervention.

- Demonstrates through experiments that MeMo can match or closely approach state-of-the-art performance on diverse logical reasoning, STEM, and commonsense reasoning tasks, showcasing superior generalization capabilities.

In summary, MeMo explores the idea of generalist prompting and provides a simple yet effective implementation that saves human effort in prompt design while unlocking more of LLMs' potential across different domains. The concept of mental models for prompting is the key innovation proposed.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Generalist prompting - The concept of creating prompting methods that can achieve optimal or near-optimal performance across a wide variety of tasks without requiring manual selection or customization for specific problems.

- Mental models - Cognitive structures and strategies that simplify problems and facilitate reasoning and decision-making. The paper proposes introducing this concept to language models to allow them to select appropriate reasoning approaches. 

- Multi-disciplinary knowledge - Using knowledge and frameworks from different disciplines to solve problems, rather than relying on isolated facts. This is related to the concept of mental models.

- Zero-shot learning - Applying models to new tasks without additional fine-tuning on task-specific data. The proposed MeMo prompting approach aims to achieve strong zero-shot performance on various tasks.

- Prompt engineering - Designing input prompts to steer language models' inference and text generation process. The paper uses this technique to provide definitions and examples of mental models.

- Logical reasoning - Assessing language models' ability to make deductions and inferences. Tested using datasets like StrategyQA and FOLIO.

- Commonsense reasoning - Testing models' capabilities relating to everyday knowledge and reasoning. Evaluated using BIG-bench datasets.

In summary, the key focus is on exploring generalizable prompting approaches through the concept of mental models to improve language models' reasoning and problem-solving abilities across diverse tasks in zero-shot settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the MeMo method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "generalist prompting" - what are the key principles and criteria that a generalist prompting method should fulfill? How well does MeMo satisfy these criteria compared to other existing prompting methods?

2. The paper proposes using the concept of "mental models" for prompting. What are some examples of existing prompting methods that could be viewed as manifestations of specific mental models? How does explicitly introducing multiple mental models help with generalization across tasks? 

3. The definition and examples of mental models are provided to the LLMs through prompt engineering. What mechanisms allow this information to be effectively incorporated by the LLMs during inference and generation? How could the quality of information distillation be further improved?

4. When presented with a question, how do the LLMs determine which mental model(s) are most relevant or applicable? What kind of reasoning strategies might they employ for this selection process? 

5. For the logical reasoning tasks, there is significant diversity in the mental models proposed by the LLMs for different question types and domains. What factors account for these differences? How could consistency in mental model usage be promoted?

6. For the STEM tasks, problem-solving strategies form a major proportion of the identified mental models. How does the prior abstraction of concepts relate to the subsequent application of strategies? Could the LLMs benefit from explicitly separating out these two stages?

7. The ablation studies indicate that both the definition and examples contribute positively but to varying extents across tasks. What hypotheses might explain these differential effects? Are there ways to make one or both components more impactful in a broader sense?

8. From analyzing the mental models applied, do there appear to be any systemic gaps or limitations in the LLMs' capabilities around certain types of reasoning tasks or knowledge domains? If yes, how could these gaps be addressed?

9. The computational overhead of MeMo is highlighted as a limitation. What existing or potential methods could help mitigate this issue without compromising on performance? Could the concept of mental models itself assist with efficiency in some way?

10. What future avenues for research could help build upon the fundamental concept presented in this work? What enhancements to MeMo might be explored with the evolution of prompting capabilities and growth in scale of LLMs?
