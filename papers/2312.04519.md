# [Bootstrapping Autonomous Radars with Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04519)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework called Radical to improve radar-based perception for self-driving cars. It addresses the challenge of limited labeled radar data by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled radar data. The method uses a contrastive learning approach with both cross-modal (radar-vision) and intra-modal (radar-radar) objectives. It distills knowledge from both a pretrained vision model and the structure of radar data itself. A novel radar-specific augmentation technique called Radar MIMO Mask is also introduced, which manipulates raw signals from different transmit/receive antenna pairs to generate new radar views. Extensive experiments on the Radatron dataset for car detection demonstrate that Radical outperforms supervised baselines by 5.8% in mean average precision. The results showcase the ability of self-supervised pretraining to produce high-quality radar embeddings without needing extra human annotations, overcoming issues like specularity and sparsity. The proposed techniques could enable lifelong learning and better utilization of unlabeled radar data from evolving hardware.
