# ChatVideo: A Tracklet-centric Multimodal and Versatile Video
  Understanding System

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis seems to be:How to build an interactive video understanding system that provides comprehensive functionality and excellent interactivity for multimodal and versatile video understanding?The authors propose a prototype system called ChatVideo that combines the capabilities of ChatGPT and various Video Foundation Models (ViFMs) to achieve this goal. The key ideas and components include:- Adopting a tracklet-centric video understanding paradigm, where tracklets (object instances) are the basic unit for analyzing video content. - Using ViFMs like OmniVL and OmniTracker to detect tracklets in videos and predict their attributes like appearance, motion, trajectories. - Storing the tracklet information in a database that can be flexibly queried.- Introducing a database manager to translate user questions into database queries.- Leveraging ChatGPT's conversational and reasoning abilities to process the query results and interact with users.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining ViFMs and ChatGPT in a tracklet-centric framework, they can develop a versatile video understanding system with strong interactivity. The paper seems focused on proposing this framework and conducting case studies to demonstrate its potential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel video understanding system called ChatVideo that combines the capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT and various video foundation models (ViFMs) to achieve versatile and interactive video understanding. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing a tracklet-centric video understanding paradigm, where tracklets are treated as the basic units of a video and their properties are annotated by different ViFMs. - Presenting the ChatVideo system that stores the tracklet information in a database and utilizes a database manager to translate user questions into database queries. ChatGPT then processes and summarizes the results to generate natural language responses.- Conducting extensive case studies on different types of videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatVideo in answering various video-related questions through conversational interaction.In summary, the main novelty lies in the tracklet-centric paradigm and the integration of ChatGPT with ViFMs to build an interactive and versatile video understanding prototype system. This represents an important step towards developing more capable and user-friendly video AI systems.
