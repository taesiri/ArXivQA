## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to build an interactive video understanding system that can support versatile functionality and natural language interaction. Specifically:

- Existing video models are limited to specific tasks and lack generalization capabilities, making deployment difficult. The authors argue that a bottom-up approach built on tracklet understanding is better suited. 

- There is a lack of video systems that can interactively understand and discuss video content through natural language. The authors propose combining various video foundation models with conversational capabilities of ChatGPT.

- Prior video QA systems only answer individual questions without conversational context. The authors aim to enable a more natural communicative experience.

- Many video QA methods rely only on global features and may struggle with complex questions requiring fine-grained understanding. The tracklet-centric paradigm is intended to provide this capability.

In summary, the key questions/problems are how to design an interactive video understanding system that: 1) supports versatile functionality through integrating specialized models, 2) provides conversational abilities for natural interaction, and 3) enables fine-grained understanding through tracklet-based parsing and reasoning.
