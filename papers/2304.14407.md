# ChatVideo: A Tracklet-centric Multimodal and Versatile Video
  Understanding System

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis seems to be:How to build an interactive video understanding system that provides comprehensive functionality and excellent interactivity for multimodal and versatile video understanding?The authors propose a prototype system called ChatVideo that combines the capabilities of ChatGPT and various Video Foundation Models (ViFMs) to achieve this goal. The key ideas and components include:- Adopting a tracklet-centric video understanding paradigm, where tracklets (object instances) are the basic unit for analyzing video content. - Using ViFMs like OmniVL and OmniTracker to detect tracklets in videos and predict their attributes like appearance, motion, trajectories. - Storing the tracklet information in a database that can be flexibly queried.- Introducing a database manager to translate user questions into database queries.- Leveraging ChatGPT's conversational and reasoning abilities to process the query results and interact with users.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining ViFMs and ChatGPT in a tracklet-centric framework, they can develop a versatile video understanding system with strong interactivity. The paper seems focused on proposing this framework and conducting case studies to demonstrate its potential.
