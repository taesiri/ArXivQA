# [Location Agnostic Adaptive Rain Precipitation Prediction using Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Rain precipitation prediction is challenging as it depends on weather and meteorological features which vary across locations. Models that work well in one location may not work well in other locations due to distribution shifts.
- Due to climate change, weather patterns are rapidly changing even within the same location from year to year, making models ineffective over time.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an adaptive deep learning framework to provide generalized precipitation prediction across locations. 
- The framework leverages domain adaptation techniques to transfer insights from a source domain to a target domain with a significant domain shift. This allows the model trained on one location to adapt to new locations.

Methodology:
- A deep neural network is trained on source domain data (weather data from Dhaka city) to predict precipitation. 
- The network is then adapted to the target domain (weather data from Paris, Los Angeles and Tokyo) using both source and target data.
- The adaptation loss function includes MSE losses from both source and target domain data.

Experiments:
- Weather dataset with 20 years of data including air temperature, humidity, wind etc.
- Dhaka city used as source domain. Paris, LA, Tokyo used as separate target domains.
- Compared deep learning with and without adaptation.

Results: 
- Deep learning with adaptation reduced error by 43.51% for Paris, 5.09% for LA, 38.62% for Tokyo over no adaptation.
- Outperformed other methods like Random Forest, AdaBoost in target domain.

Main Contributions:
- Novel location-agnostic adaptive precipitation prediction using deep learning
- Framework to leverage domain adaptation for precipitation prediction across locations
- Demonstrated improved performance over non-adaptive and other methods

Future Work: 
- Model fitting with fewer features for efficiency
- Unsupervised domain adaptation
