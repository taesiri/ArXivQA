# [From Adoption to Adaption: Tracing the Diffusion of New Emojis on   Twitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores the adoption and adaptation of new emojis after they are introduced in Unicode standard versions. Specifically, it analyzes the diffusion patterns of new emojis on Twitter, including their usage frequencies, sentiment associations, and semantic shifts. It also proposes a framework to interpret the meaning of new emojis using language models.

Methodology
The authors collected a large dataset of English tweets from May 2018 to May 2022, covering new emojis introduced in Unicode 11.0 to 13.0. They analyzed emoji frequency trends over time and associated contexts. They found emoji adoption rates and semantics influence diffusion, and some emojis experience sentiment shifts during propagation. 

To interpret emojis, they propose using language models fine-tuned on emoji prediction to extract words or old emojis with similar contexts as new emojis. They quantify semantic similarity using attention scores for words and inference scores for old emojis. The framework is shown to effectively surface interpretable terms related to emoji semantics.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of new emoji diffusion patterns on Twitter, regarding popularity dynamics, sentiment evolution, and role of semantics
- Framework to interpret new emojis by identifying words and old emojis with similar semantics using fine-tuned language models  
- Emoji substitution method that replaces new emojis with semantically similar old ones to improve sentiment classifier performance without retraining

The analysis offers insights into emerging language units spreading through social networks. The interpretation framework helps models handle new emojis. The emoji replacement technique demonstrates improved model generalization. Together, the contributions further the understanding and handling of evolving online communication.
