# Region Normalization for Image Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper focuses on the problem of mean and variance shifts caused by full-spatial normalization in image inpainting neural networks. The central hypothesis is that existing full-spatial normalization methods like batch normalization and instance normalization are sub-optimal for image inpainting because they ignore the impact of corrupted image regions on normalization. The key research questions addressed are:- How do corrupted image regions affect normalization mean and variance estimates in inpainting networks?- Can separating normalization by image regions improve inpainting network training and performance?To address these questions, the authors propose a new normalization method called Region Normalization (RN) that normalizes different spatial regions separately based on the input mask. The main hypothesis is that RN can overcome the limitations of full-spatial normalization and improve inpainting network training and reconstruction quality. Experiments validate the effectiveness of RN for inpainting.In summary, the central hypothesis is that full-spatial normalization is problematic for inpainting, and the key research contribution is proposing and validating Region Normalization as a better alternative.
