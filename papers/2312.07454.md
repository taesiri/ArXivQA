# ["You Might Like It": How People Respond to Small Talk in Human-Robot   Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07454)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper explores people's engagement and attitudes towards a non-anthropomorphic robot manipulator that initiates small talk with users during a collaborative assembly task. Through an exploratory study with 20 participants, the authors found that most participants (18 out of 20) interacted socially with the robot, with 9 participants even asking questions back to the robot. The study analyzed the frequency and length of users' responses to the robot's task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogue. Results showed that small talk led to pleasant experiences for users and did not negatively impact task efficiency. The paper discusses the potential for integrating small talk in non-social collaborative robots to enhance rapport. It also presents three design guidelines: using dynamic and user-aware conversational frameworks; balancing small talk with task performance; and intentionally calibrating user expectations of the robot's capabilities. Overall, this exploratory research provides initial evidence that non-anthropomorphic robots can effectively engage users through small talk to strengthen trust and understanding in human-robot collaborations.
