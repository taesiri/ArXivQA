# [Search Strategies for Self-driving Laboratories with Pending Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03466)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper builds a simulator to model a multi-stage self-driving laboratory (SDL) and compares optimization strategies for handling the delayed feedback that results from running experiments in asynchronous parallel. The authors mimic real SDL experimental data to create test functions, then evaluate the performance of expected improvement, noisy expected improvement, mode cycling, and random search under different amounts of delay and problem dimensionality. Their key finding is that increasing throughput by running more experiments in parallel comes with a trade-off of reducing Bayesian optimization performance due to delayed feedback. Specifically, adding more experimental delay linearly increases cumulative regret across test functions, while adding more dimensions exponentially increases regret and makes the strategies perform closer to random search. Though inconclusive on a single best performing strategy, this work provides a framework and benchmarks to guide SDL operators in balancing the efficiency gains of parallelization versus losses from delayed feedback for their specific application.
