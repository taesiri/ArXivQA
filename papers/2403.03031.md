# [Learning to Use Tools via Cooperative and Interactive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing tools are difficult for agents to use correctly due to needing appropriate arguments, interpreting lengthy outputs, and chaining tools. Single agents struggle with all these challenges. 

Proposed Solution:
- A cooperative agent framework called ConAgents that consists of three specialized agents - a Grounding Agent, Execution Agent, and Observing Agent.
- The Grounding Agent generates high-level plans. The Execution Agent executes tools based on the plans. The Observing Agent parses lengthy outputs to extract relevant values.
- Two calibration methods are proposed to help the Execution Agent invoke tools correctly and the Observing Agent handle outputs properly.

Main Contributions:
- A new cooperative agent framework that divides responsibilities across specialized agents to address challenges in using real-world tools.
- Automated calibration methods that allow agents to learn to use new tools correctly through interactions.
- Extensive experiments showing ConAgents can solve tasks with higher accuracy than single agents. It also has better sample efficiency and interpretability.
- New annotated datasets with fine-grained task solving trajectories to support training and evaluation.

In summary, the paper proposes a cooperative multi-agent approach to effectively use real-world tools by dividing up challenges across specialized agents and introducing automated calibration techniques. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the benefits of this approach over single agent methods.
