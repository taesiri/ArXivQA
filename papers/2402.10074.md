# [Class-Balanced and Reinforced Active Learning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10074)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "GraphCBAL: Class-Balanced Active Learning for Graph Neural Networks via Reinforcement Learning":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on node classification tasks. However, GNNs typically require a large amount of labeled data for training, which is expensive to obtain. 
- Active learning queries the most valuable unlabeled samples for annotation to maximize model performance with lower labeling costs. However, existing active learning methods for GNNs may select samples with a highly skewed class distribution, especially in scenarios with imbalanced classes.
- Training GNNs on such imbalanced labeled data leads to prediction bias towards majority classes and overall performance degradation. It is important for active learning to acquire class-balanced and informative labeled nodes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GraphCBAL, a novel reinforced active learning approach to select class-balanced and valuable nodes for GNNs.
- It formulates the active learning problem as a Markov Decision Process and trains a policy network with reinforcement learning to learn the optimal query strategy.
- The state space incorporates node centrality, uncertainty, class diversity, etc. to help identify valuable nodes. The reward balances model performance gain and a class diversity score.
- It further upgrades to GraphCBAL++ by adding a penalty to the reward and punishment mechanisms to enforce selecting minority class samples.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes GraphCBAL, the first reinforced active learning approach that introduces class balance for GNNs.
- Designs a class-balance aware state space and reward function to achieve trade-off between performance and class balance.
- Upgrades it to GraphCBAL++ with punishment mechanisms to obtain more balanced labeled nodes.
- Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches on both performance and class balance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a reinforced class-balanced active learning approach for graph neural networks that learns an optimal policy to acquire informative and class-balanced nodes for annotation in order to maximize model performance while maintaining class balance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing GraphCBAL, a novel class-balanced active learning approach for graph neural networks (GNNs). To the best of the authors' knowledge, they are the first to introduce class balance to reinforced active learning on graphs.

2. Designing an effective reward function that can strike the trade-off between classification performance and class balance. They also introduce class-balance-aware state space for sampling informative nodes.

3. Upgrading GraphCBAL to GraphCBAL++ by incorporating a punishment mechanism to obtain a more class-balanced labeled set. 

4. Conducting extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets to show that the proposed methods can obtain a more class-balanced labeled set, which leads to comparable or better classification results than state-of-the-art competitors.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a reinforced active learning framework for GNNs that focuses on acquiring a class-balanced and informative labeled set, in order to improve both performance and class balance in node classification.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Graph neural networks (GNNs)
- Active learning
- Class imbalance/class-imbalanced learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Markov Decision Process (MDP)
- Class balance
- Imbalance ratio
- GraphCBAL
- GraphCBAL++
- Reward function
- State space
- Actor-critic
- Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

The paper proposes a reinforced class-balanced active learning framework called GraphCBAL for graph neural networks. It formulates the active learning problem as an MDP and uses reinforcement learning with an A2C algorithm to learn an optimal policy to query valuable and class-balanced samples. The reward and state spaces are designed to achieve a trade-off between model performance and class balance. An upgraded version called GraphCBAL++ further improves class balance through a punishment mechanism. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches. So the key focus is on class-balanced active learning for GNNs using RL.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel class-balanced active learning approach for graph neural networks. Can you explain in detail the motivation behind pursuing class balance in active learning for graphs? What issues can arise with class imbalance?

2. The key innovation seems to be the design of the reward function, which incorporates both performance gain and a class diversity score. Walk through how these two components allow the method to balance performance and class balance. How is the tradeoff controlled?

3. Explain the state representation and each of the five factors that characterize it. Why are factors like centrality, uncertainty, and class diversity important for selecting valuable and class-balanced samples? 

4. The method upgrades the base model to GraphCBAL++ by adding a punishment mechanism. Explain what this mechanism is and how it results in acquiring more class-balanced labeled nodes. How is the penalty term incorporated?

5. The policy network is trained with advantage actor-critic (A2C). Walk through the actor and critic networks and how A2C allows stable optimization of the policy. What are the loss functions for the actor and critic?

6. The method mentions adopting a transferable active learning scheme. What does this mean? Why is transferability useful when training the policy network?

7. Analyze the results in Table 2. Why does the method perform particularly better on highly skewed datasets like Co-Phy and Co-CS? What metrics reflect this?

8. In the ablation study, which state features seem most important? Why does removing class diversity lead to a significant performance drop and lower class balance?

9. The method shows the impact of varying certain hyperparameters like the scaling factor alpha. Discuss the trends observed when modifying alpha and the penalty term eta.  

10. Can you think of ways the method could be extended? For example, how could the concept of class balance be incorporated into other active learning approaches for graphs?
