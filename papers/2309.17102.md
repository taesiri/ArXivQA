# [Guiding Instruction-based Image Editing via Multimodal Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17102)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can multimodal large language models (MLLMs) be leveraged to improve instruction-based image editing?

Specifically, the authors investigate using MLLMs to generate more expressive instructions that provide explicit guidance for editing an input image towards a desired goal image. The key ideas are:

- MLLMs can be used to derive more detailed and explicit instructions from brief human-provided instructions. This is done by prompting the MLLM to imagine what the edited image will look like given the instruction.

- The explicit instructions provide a clearer visual imagination of the editing goal that can guide the image manipulation model. 

- End-to-end training can be used to update both the MLLM and diffusion model jointly to perform instruction-based editing.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using MLLMs to generate expressive instructions with explicit visual guidance will improve the performance of instruction-based image editing models. The experiments aim to demonstrate this through both automatic metrics and human evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a method called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) to improve instruction-based image editing. 

The key ideas are:

- Using a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to derive more expressive and detailed instructions from ambiguous human commands. This provides better guidance for the intended editing goal.

- The MLLM learns to generate visual tokens that serve as an imagination of the editing intention. These tokens are transformed into latent guidance vectors.

- A diffusion model is trained jointly with the MLLM in an end-to-end manner. It performs the actual image editing by following the latent guidance from the MLLM.

- Comprehensive experiments show MGIE enhances various aspects of editing like Photoshop-style modification, global optimization, and local object changes over baseline methods.

In summary, the main contribution is using MLLMs to produce expressive instructions that capture visual details better. The joint training provides explicit imagination-based guidance to the diffusion model for high-quality instruction-based image editing.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate expressive instructions that provide explicit guidance for improving instruction-based image editing using diffusion models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve instruction-based image editing. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like InsPix2Pix and CLIP which use static image embeddings. Using an MLLM provides more contextual understanding.

- The idea of generating more expressive instructions from the MLLM to guide the image editing model is clever. Other methods like InsPix2Pix just take the original brief instruction which can be ambiguous. Deriving more detailed instructions helps the model capture the intended edit better.

- Evaluating on a diverse set of image editing datasets (EVR, GIER, MA5k, MagicBrush) covers a wider range of editing tasks compared to prior work that often focuses on just one dataset. This allows a more comprehensive assessment.

- Both automatic metrics and human evaluations are used to evaluate the method. Human eval is especially important for an image editing task to see if results match user intentions. Using both types of evaluation is more thorough than papers that rely on just automated metrics.

- The method seems to outperform prior state-of-the-art like InsPix2Pix fairly significantly across datasets based on the automatic metrics and human evals. This suggests the MLLM guidance is an important advancement for instruction-based editing.

- One limitation compared to some other recent work is the method still requires a single instruction for each image edit. Handling compositional instructions remains challenging.

Overall, the use of MLLMs for guided image editing and the human evaluation results seem to be important contributions over prior instruction-based editing approaches. The comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets is also notable. It advances the state-of-the-art in an important research direction of improving editing from natural language instructions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing methods to handle more complex compositional instructions that require multiple editing steps. The current approach works well for simple single-step instructions, but has difficulty following more elaborate multi-step commands.

- Improving language grounding and numerical perception in the model. This could allow for more precise targeting of specific objects or regions to edit based on their description or quantity stated in the instruction. 

- Incorporating safety checks and bias mitigation strategies into the model training and inference. Since the model builds on large pre-trained foundations, it may inherit problematic biases that should be addressed.

- Exploring different prompt formulations and summarization techniques for deriving the expressive instructions. The current "what will this look like if" prompt works well, but other phrasings could be explored.

- Training and evaluating the approach on a wider range of editing datasets and tasks beyond those studied in the paper. Expanding to additional datasets could further demonstrate the generalizability.

- Improving the inference efficiency and GPU memory requirements to make the approach more practical. Though it currently has feasible efficiency, reducing compute needs could aid adoption.

- Studying how different sizes of the foundation LM models impact performance. Larger LMs appear beneficial, but a detailed analysis would provide insight.

- Comparing to more baselines like other instruction encoders or mask-then-inpaint methods. Additional strong baselines could better highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.

In summary, the main directions are enhancing the model's compositional understanding, grounding capability, safety, generalization, efficiency, and comparability to alternative methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE), a method that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve instruction-based image editing. MGIE consists of an MLLM and a diffusion model. The MLLM learns to derive concise yet expressive instructions that provide explicit visual-related guidance for the intended editing goal. These instructions are fed to the diffusion model along with the input image, allowing the model to jointly capture the visual imagination and perform image manipulation through end-to-end training. Experiments on various editing tasks like Photoshop-style modification, global photo optimization, and local editing demonstrate that MGIE significantly strengthens instruction-based editing compared to baselines, with improved performance in automatic metrics and human evaluation. The key advantages are that MGIE can produce reasonable edits from ambiguous human instructions, while maintaining competitive efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) to improve instruction-based image editing. Instruction-based image editing allows users to edit images by providing natural language instructions, rather than requiring detailed descriptions or masks. However, current methods struggle when instructions are ambiguous or lack sufficient detail. 

MGIE addresses this by using a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to derive more expressive instructions from the original instructions. It then provides these expressive instructions as guidance to a diffusion model that performs the actual image editing. By training the MLLM and diffusion model together end-to-end, MGIE is able to produce edited images that better reflect the user's original intent, even when instructions are brief. Experiments on various image editing datasets demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The key advantages of MGIE are producing more reasonable edits from ambiguous instructions, while maintaining efficient inference.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) for improving instruction-based image editing. MGIE uses a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to take an ambiguous image editing instruction and generate a more detailed and concrete "expressive" instruction specifying how the image should be edited. This expressive instruction provides clearer guidance for the image editing model, which is a diffusion model conditioned on the input image and the derived expressive instruction. Specifically, the expressive instruction is summarized to be more concise and appended with "visual tokens" that connect the text modality of the MLLM to the image modality of the diffusion model. An editing head network transforms these visual tokens into a latent visual imagination vector that guides the diffusion model to perform the intended edit. The MLLM and diffusion model are trained end-to-end, with the MLLM learning to generate useful expressive instructions and the diffusion model learning to follow these instructions to edit the image. Experiments on various image editing datasets demonstrate that providing explicit visual guidance through expressive instructions from an MLLM significantly improves editing performance compared to directly using the original ambiguous instructions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It focuses on improving instruction-based image editing, where people can provide natural language commands/instructions to manipulate images, without needing to provide detailed descriptions or masks. 

- Existing methods have limitations in fully capturing the intended edits from brief human instructions. For example, instructions like "make the image healthier" are ambiguous.

- The paper proposes using large multimodal language models (MLLMs) to help derive more expressive and detailed instructions from the original brief instructions. 

- It introduces a framework called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) which jointly trains an MLLM model to generate expressive instructions, and a diffusion model to actually edit the images following the expressive instructions.

- Through end-to-end training, the MLLM provides explicit imagination/visualization of the editing goal to guide the diffusion model. This allows better interpreting ambiguous instructions.

- They evaluate on tasks like Photoshop-style editing, global photo enhancement, and local object changes. Results show their method outperforms baselines in automatically matching ground truth goals and in human evaluations.

In summary, the key problem is enhancing instruction-based image editing by using MLLMs to derive more expressive instructions from ambiguous human inputs, which better guide the editing model. The proposed MGIE framework addresses this effectively.
