# [Fourier Prompt Tuning for Modality-Incomplete Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16923)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of modality-incomplete scene segmentation (MISS) in multi-modal semantic segmentation systems. MISS refers to failures at both the system level (entire modality missing) and sensor level (blurry images, misalignment, etc). Current methods rely too heavily on certain predominant modalities like RGB or depth, suffering significant performance drops when those modalities are missing. The paper aims to improve robustness against MISS scenarios while maintaining efficiency.

Method: 
Two main methods are proposed - Missing-aware Modal Switch (MMS) and Fourier Prompt Tuning (FPT). 

MMS is a training strategy that randomly drops modalities using binary switches during training. This prevents over-reliance on certain modalities. Dense vs sparse modalities are handled differently - at least one dense modality is retained for segmentation.

FPT incorporates global spectral cues into prompt tokens using FFT, then propagates spectral info across all feature tokens using cross-attention. This complementary frequency-based information makes the model robust against MISS.

Main Contributions:
- Establish a new comprehensive task, MISS, covering both system-level and sensor-level failures in multi-modal segmentation
- Propose MMS to prevent predominant modality reliance during training via stochastic bit switches  
- Develop FPT to inject spectral cues into limited prompt tokens, enabling efficiency and robustness

Experiments show consistent gains over baselines in MISS scenarios, while maintaining performance on complete data. Eg. 5.84% better mIoU than state-of-the-art when predominant modality is missing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Missing-aware Modal Switch training strategy and Fourier Prompt Tuning method to improve the robustness of multi-modal semantic segmentation models against system-level modality absence and sensor-level modality failures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new comprehensive task called Modality-Incomplete Scene Segmentation (MISS) to cover both system-level modality absence and sensor-level modality errors in multi-modal semantic segmentation.

2) Introducing the Missing-aware Modal Switch (MMS) method to manage missing modalities during training using a few bits for modality dropout control. It leads to over 20% mIoU enhancement when the predominant modality is missing while maintaining performance with full modalities. 

3) Proposing the Fourier Prompt Tuning (FPT) method to incorporate representative spectral information into a limited number of learnable prompts via a frequency-spatial cross-attention mechanism. This enables efficient fine-tuning for the MISS task while maintaining robustness.

So in summary, the main contributions are: 1) defining the MISS task, 2) the MMS method for handling missing modalities, and 3) the FPT method for efficient fine-tuning against missing modalities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Modality-Incomplete Scene Segmentation (MISS) - The comprehensive task studied in the paper that covers both system-level modality absence and sensor-level modality errors in multi-modal semantic segmentation.

- Missing-aware Modal Switch (MMS) - The method proposed in the paper to manage missing modalities during training using a few bits for modality dropout control. It helps mitigate predominant modality reliance. 

- Fourier Prompt Tuning (FPT) - The method proposed to inject spectral information into soft prompts via a frequency-spatial cross-attention mechanism, enabling efficient fine-tuning for MISS while maintaining robustness.

- Multi-modal semantic segmentation - The overall field of fusing information from multiple sensor modalities (e.g. RGB, depth, LiDAR, thermal) for semantic segmentation. The paper aims to tackle robustness issues in this area.

- Parameter-efficient learning - A key focus of the methods proposed, aiming to systematically adjust model parameters with minimal computational resources added. FPT only adds 1.1% extra parameters.

- Spectral and spatial information - The key types of information encoded in the FPT prompt tokens to make them robust. The spectral information comes from Fourier analysis.

The key focus areas are handling missing modalities and lack of robustness in multi-modal segmentation networks, using parameter-efficient tuning methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Missing-aware Modal Switch (MMS) method to manage missing modalities during training. How does MMS help mitigate predominant modality reliance compared to prior works with a predetermined missing ratio?

2. The paper mentions using a few bits to govern modal dropout with MMS. How is assigning binary switches to modalities more efficient than mapping image indexes to missing conditions? Explain the difference.

3. The proposed Fourier Prompt Tuning (FPT) incorporates spectral information into prompts. Why is spectral information more suitable to encode in limited prompt tokens compared to spatial information for segmentation?

4. Explain the frequency-spatial cross-attention mechanism in FPT and how it facilitates injection of spectral information into prompts. How does this complement the spatial characteristics of feature tokens?

5. How does training with MMS ensure robustness of models when tested on datasets with and without missing modalities? Explain the differences observed.

6. Analyze the results in Table 2 and discuss why FPT with MMS outperforms other methods by a large margin when RGB is missing in Cityscapes dataset.

7. Compare the performances of models trained with complete modalities and with MMS across different sensor failure cases in Table 5. What inferences can be drawn?

8. The paper ablates FPT with only spectrum or spatiality in prompts. Analyze these results and justify the importance of both prompt spaces.  

9. Critically analyze the segmentation visualization results with missing modalities in Figure 8. Why does FPT with MMS perform better than other methods?

10. What are the limitations of the proposed methods? Suggest potential improvements or future research directions.
