# [Fine-grained Controllable Video Generation via Object Appearance and   Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02919)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FACTOR, a method for fine-grained controllable video generation that allows users to precisely control object appearances and context in generated videos. The key idea is to augment existing text-to-video models with additional control signals specifying object trajectories drawn by users and reference images defining object appearances. Specifically, FACTOR introduces a joint encoder to model interactions between text prompts and control signals, as well as adaptive cross-attention layers that are inserted into the text-to-video model to enable controllability. A key advantage is that FACTOR achieves controllable video generation without needing per-subject finetuning or optimization at test time. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT and user studies validate that FACTOR significantly improves controllability metrics by 67-73% over baselines, and generates higher-quality videos with better alignment to user-provided object trajectories and appearance references. The method brings an additional benefit of synthesizing more complex videos involving interactions between customized entities. Overall, FACTOR provides an intuitive interface for users to translate creative ideas into customized video content with precision control.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called FACTOR for fine-grained controllable video generation that allows users to precisely control object appearances and contexts, including locations and categories, in conjunction with text prompts through a unified framework of joint encoding and adaptive cross-attention layers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Targeting a new task of fine-grained controllable video generation that aims to synthesize videos via appearance and context from easy-to-give user inputs. 

2) Proposing a generic and unified framework for controllable video generation. It is achieved through adaptive training to augment text-to-video models for fine-grained control without test time optimization.  

3) Validating that their method offers better controllability compared to prior works and showing the additional benefit of their model in creating complex interactions, which is challenging for existing text-to-video models.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing an approach (FACTOR) to achieve fine-grained control over video generation through intuitive user inputs like drawing object trajectories and providing appearance examples. The method adapts an existing text-to-video model to generate videos satisfying these controls.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the motivation behind proposing a fine-grained controllable video generation model compared to existing text-to-video models? How does providing additional control signals help achieve better alignment between the generated video and user intent?

2. Explain the advantages of using sparse, user-friendly control signals like trajectory drawings and appearance images rather than dense signals like edge maps or pose extracted from reference videos. How does this reduce the effort required from users?  

3. The paper proposes a joint encoding module to model the interaction between text prompts and fine-grained control signals. What is the intuition behind this? How does joint encoding help compared to separate encoders?

4. Explain the adaptive cross-attention module in detail. Why are adaptive layers inserted into the transformer blocks rather than appending them? How does this help preserve text-to-video generation capability?

5. What are the different components for encoding the entity-level fine-grained control? Explain how the description, location, and appearance embeddings are obtained and fused to get the final entity embedding. 

6. The method relies on an object detector and tracker to obtain supervision for entity trajectories from the training videos. Discuss any limitations this may impose on the diversity and complexity of motions that can be generated.

7. Analyze the quantitative results in Table 1. Why does the model obtain lower CLIP-Text scores compared to text-only models but better trajectory and appearance alignment metrics?

8. Compare the qualitative results with state-of-the-art text-to-video models in Figs. 5 and 6. What are the key differences showcasing improved controllability?

9. Discuss some of the limitations of the current framework, especially regarding model resolution, consistency between different control signals, and amount of motion generated. 

10. Suggest possible extensions to the framework to address limitations and achieve control over additional aspects like background, camera motion, etc.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-to-video models have limited controllability over the generated videos based on user-provided text prompts. Users often face difficulties in providing detailed information to precisely control the model's output such as the movement and appearance of objects. 

Recently proposed controllable video generation models rely on dense control signals extracted from reference videos, which is impractical for users to provide. Models for appearance control require per-subject finetuning.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FACTOR, a framework for fine-grained controllable video generation to achieve detailed control over object appearances and context.  

Context control includes:
1) Precise object trajectories provided through user hand-drawing 
2) Visual appearance provided by example images

The key ideas are:
1) A joint encoder to model the interaction between text prompts and fine-grained control
2) Adaptive cross-attention layers inserted into a text-to-video model to take new control signals
   - Only inserted layers optimized to adapt model while preserving text-to-video capability

This allows control over multiple entities with intuitive user input while being finetuning-free for appearance control.

Main Contributions:
1) New task of fine-grained controllable video generation with easy-to-provide user control
2) Unified framework to augment text-to-video models for fine-grained control via joint encoding and adaptive training
3) 70% improvement in controllability metrics over baselines and ability to create complex entity interactions

The results validate that FACTOR allows better control over object appearances and trajectories compared to state-of-the-art text-to-video models.
