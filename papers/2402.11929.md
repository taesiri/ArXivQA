# [DiLightNet: Fine-grained Lighting Control for Diffusion-based Image   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion models for text-to-image generation exhibit bias in the lighting of the generated images, with lighting being highly correlated with image content. While diffusion models can generate images under different lighting conditions, there is currently no method to precisely control the lighting independently from the content in a fine-grained way using text prompts.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a 3-stage pipeline to enable fine-grained control over lighting during diffusion-based text-to-image generation:

1. Generate provisional image under default lighting using a pretrained diffusion model from text prompt.

2. Resynthesize foreground object with consistent lighting:
    - Compute radiance hints by estimating coarse depth/shape from provisional image and rendering under target lighting with canonical material
    - Pass radiance hints multiplied by encoded provisional image to refined diffusion model "DiLightNet" to generate foreground object with shape/texture from provisional image but with lighting consistent with radiance hints
    
3. Inpaint background consistent with foreground lighting

Main Contributions:

- Identify and demonstrate bias in lighting of text-to-image diffusion models
- Propose using "radiance hints" to guide diffusion process for lighting control without need for precise geometry
- Introduce DiLightNet - a refinement of diffusion model using encoded provisional image and radiance hints to exert control over lighting
- Demonstrate method producing consistent and controllable lighting across variety of shapes, materials and lighting conditions
- Enable new level of control during text-to-image generation by independently controlling lighting in a fine-grained manner

The key insight is that precise geometry is not needed to guide the diffusion process, only an approximation of lighting encoded in the radiance hints. By guiding the sampling, the generative power of diffusion models can fill in realistic details. This allows exerting more independent control over lighting during text-to-image generation.
