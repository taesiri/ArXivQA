# [MasonPerplexity at Multimodal Hate Speech Event Detection 2024: Hate   Speech and Target Detection Using Transformer Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01967)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
The paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting hate speech and identifying targets of hate speech in multimodal content - specifically text embedded images related to political events. This is an important and challenging problem as offensiveness can be conveyed in both textual and visual modalities. 

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose transformer-based models to address the two sub-tasks:

Sub-task A (Hate Speech Detection): An XLM-RoBERTa-large model is used to classify images as either containing hate speech or not.

Sub-task B (Target Identification): An ensemble approach combining XLM-RoBERTa-base, BERTweet-large and BERT-base is used to classify targets into individual, community or organization. 

To handle class imbalance, data augmentation using back-translation is employed.

Key Outcomes:
- The XLM-RoBERTa model achieves an F1 score of 0.83 on sub-task A, ranking 3rd place
- The ensemble approach achieves an F1 score of 0.67 on sub-task B, ranking 3rd place

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates transformer-based models can effectively detect hate speech and targets in multimodal politically-related images
- Shows data augmentation helps handle class imbalance 
- Compares performance of different transformer architectures (XLM-RoBERTa, BERTweet, BERT)
- Provides analysis of errors and limitations to inform future research

The paper makes a valuable contribution towards creating safer online spaces by developing automated hate speech detection for multimodal content.
