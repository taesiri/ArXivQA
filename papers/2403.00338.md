# [Semi-Instruct: Bridging Natural-Instruct and Self-Instruct for Code   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There are two main paradigms for collecting instruction tuning data for Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs): natural-instruct (NI) uses human-written code data and self-instruct (SI) automatically generates instruction-code pairs. NI provides diverse and correct codes but suffers from improper formats and lacks instruction-code alignment. SI generates aligned data but has low diversity and uncertain correctness.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Semi-Instruct (SemI) to bridge NI and SI. It first converts NI codes into aligned instruction-code pairs similarly to SI. To validate code correctness, it generates test case inputs and executes NI codes on them to obtain outputs as gold references. Only codes passing test cases are retained. The pairs are ranked by test case numbers as a measure of difficulty.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes Semi-Instruct to combine strengths of NI (diversity, correctness) and SI (alignment, format).
- Generates test cases by creating inputs and executing outputs, ensuring correctness. Uses test case numbers to estimate difficulty.
- Experiments show Semi-Instruct outperforms NI and SI. Combining Semi-Instruct and SI improves over SI alone across data scales.
- Offers new perspective on using test cases for validation and difficulty measurement. Enables performance to steadily grow with more data.

In summary, the paper bridges natural-instruct and self-instruct to derive diverse and correct instruction-code pairs for tuning Code LLMs. A novel test case generation method is proposed to validate code correctness. Experiments demonstrate clear advantages over using NI or SI solely, especially in scalability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Semi-Instruct, a novel method to generate high-quality instruction-code pairs for tuning code language models by leveraging both natural-instruct data's diversity and correctness and self-instruct data's proper format and natural alignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Semi-Instruct to bridge natural-instruct and self-instruct for collecting instruction tuning data for code language models. Specifically:

1) Semi-Instruct generates proper and aligned instruction-code pairs from the diverse but improper codes in natural-instruct data using a process similar to self-instruct. This combines the strengths of both paradigms.  

2) Semi-Instruct generates test case inputs and then executes the original natural-instruct codes on those inputs to extract correct outputs and form complete test cases. This is a more effective way to validate the correctness of the generated codes.

3) Experiments show Semi-Instruct outperforms using just natural-instruct or just self-instruct data. Combining Semi-Instruct with self-instruct also leads to better performance than self-instruct alone, with steady improvement as data scale increases.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Semi-Instruct method to effectively collect high-quality instruction tuning data by bridging natural-instruct and self-instruct.

The paper proposes a new method called "Semi-Instruct" to combine the strengths of natural-instruct data (diverse and correct codes from human written sources) and self-instruct data (automatically generated instruction-code pairs) to improve instruction tuning of code large language models. Key aspects include generating test cases by executing codes to validate correctness, using the number of test cases to rank data difficulty, and showing performance improvements over using natural-instruct or self-instruct alone.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a semi-instruct method to bridge natural-instruct and self-instruct data. Can you elaborate on the key strengths and weaknesses of natural-instruct and self-instruct data that semi-instruct aims to address? 

2. A core component of semi-instruct is the generation phase where instructions, refined code, answer type and test case inputs are generated. Can you explain the purpose and importance of each of these generated components?

3. The paper describes a novel approach for constructing complete test cases by executing original code on generated inputs to obtain outputs. Why is this more effective than generating complete test cases directly? What are the key benefits?

4. Test cases are used not only to validate refined code correctness but also to measure instruction difficulty in the ranking phase. Can you explain this new perspective in detail and why it is useful? 

5. The validation phase involves retaining only refined code that passes all test cases. Why is this an effective way to ensure functional consistency between original and refined code? What are the limitations?

6. What is the high-level intuition behind ranking semi-instruct data by number of passed test cases? Do you think this is an appropriate difficulty measure? Why or why not?

7. The paper shows combining semi-instruct and self-instruct data leads to better performance than just increasing self-instruct data. What reasons are provided in the paper for this result?

8. In the ablation study, the paper examines removing or replacing various components like instructions and refined code. What key conclusions can you draw from the results about the necessity of different semi-instruct components?

9. For program synthesis tasks, what are the key advantages and disadvantages of using semi-instruct compared to either natural-instruct or self-instruct data alone?

10. The semi-instruct method aims to take the strengths of both natural-instruct and self-instruct. In your view, does it succeed at this goal? What are some ways semi-instruct could potentially be improved or extended?
