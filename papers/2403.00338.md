# [Semi-Instruct: Bridging Natural-Instruct and Self-Instruct for Code   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There are two main paradigms for collecting instruction tuning data for Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs): natural-instruct (NI) uses human-written code data and self-instruct (SI) automatically generates instruction-code pairs. NI provides diverse and correct codes but suffers from improper formats and lacks instruction-code alignment. SI generates aligned data but has low diversity and uncertain correctness.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Semi-Instruct (SemI) to bridge NI and SI. It first converts NI codes into aligned instruction-code pairs similarly to SI. To validate code correctness, it generates test case inputs and executes NI codes on them to obtain outputs as gold references. Only codes passing test cases are retained. The pairs are ranked by test case numbers as a measure of difficulty.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes Semi-Instruct to combine strengths of NI (diversity, correctness) and SI (alignment, format).
- Generates test cases by creating inputs and executing outputs, ensuring correctness. Uses test case numbers to estimate difficulty.
- Experiments show Semi-Instruct outperforms NI and SI. Combining Semi-Instruct and SI improves over SI alone across data scales.
- Offers new perspective on using test cases for validation and difficulty measurement. Enables performance to steadily grow with more data.

In summary, the paper bridges natural-instruct and self-instruct to derive diverse and correct instruction-code pairs for tuning Code LLMs. A novel test case generation method is proposed to validate code correctness. Experiments demonstrate clear advantages over using NI or SI solely, especially in scalability.
