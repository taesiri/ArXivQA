# [An unsupervised approach towards promptable defect segmentation in   laser-based additive manufacturing by Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04063)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an unsupervised learning framework for defect segmentation in additive manufacturing using a foundation model called Segment Anything Model (SAM). The authors apply this framework to segment porosity defects from X-ray computed tomography (XCT) images of metal parts produced by laser-based powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Their approach involves using k-means clustering to generate centroid images and create point prompts by sampling defect locations from the centroids. These prompts are then fed into SAM to guide the model to focus on defects during segmentation, without needing any labels or model retraining. Experiments on two unlabeled XCT image datasets with varying porosity levels demonstrate high Dice similarity coefficients, indicating effective defect segmentation. The framework exhibits robust performance even on out-of-distribution data. Key advantages are real-time inference speeds using SAM's lightweight decoder and applicability to unlabeled industrial data. The prompt-guided SAM pipeline serves as the basis for an automated manufacturing anomaly detection system, paving the path towards zero-defect manufacturing aligned with Industry 4.0 goals. Future work focuses on specialized foundation models tailored to the intricacies of industrial defects.
