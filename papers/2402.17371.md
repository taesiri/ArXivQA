# [A Dataset for Metaphor Detection in Early Medieval Hebrew Poetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a large volume of late antique and medieval Hebrew texts that represent an important linguistic and cultural bridge between Biblical and modern Hebrew. These texts frequently use figurative language like metaphors which are important for scholars in fields like literature, linguistics, and interpretation to understand. 
- Manually identifying metaphors in these texts is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. There has been no prior work on automatically detecting metaphors in either modern or pre-modern Hebrew texts.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a new dataset of 309 medieval Hebrew poems containing expert annotations for metaphorical expressions. The dataset has over 73K words with 15-21% marked as metaphors.
- They develop several neural models based on Hebrew language models (AlephBERT and BEREL) fine-tuned for metaphor detection in a sequence labeling setup. The models substantially outperform baseline approaches.
- Using the closest language model (BEREL) and techniques like weighted loss gives the best F1 score of 48.7-49.4 on the two subsets. The models also generalize reasonably to unseen words.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset for metaphor detection in ancient Hebrew texts, with expert annotations over 73K words across 309 poems.
- Baseline neural approaches for this task far surpass naive baselines, showing the feasibility of metaphor detection in such texts. 
- Analysis of pre-trained language models reveals that adapting them to the target genre is important for better metaphor detection.
- The authors hope the dataset and initial results will facilitate more research on this task and related NLP tasks for similar texts.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel annotated dataset and metaphor detection models to automate understanding figurative language in complex, low-resource ancient Hebrew texts.
