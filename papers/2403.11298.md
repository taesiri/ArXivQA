# [Multi-Sample Long Range Path Planning under Sensing Uncertainty for   Off-Road Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of long-range motion planning under sensing uncertainty for autonomous off-road vehicles. Specifically, the robot has to plan paths through previously unobserved environments over tens of kilometers, while continuously receiving noisy local observations. This is challenging because the uncertainty in sensing can lead to false obstacles or false freespace, resulting in dangerous or inefficient paths. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an algorithm called DREAMS (Dynamic Replanning via Evaluating and Aggregating Multiple Samples) that maintains the computational efficiency of determinization (converting a stochastic problem into a deterministic one) while still reasoning about uncertainty across multiple possible worlds. 

Key ideas in DREAMS:

1) Sample multiple possible worlds from the posterior distribution over environments. Plan an optimal path on each sampled world. 

2) Evaluate each planned path by simulating its cost across many other sampled worlds, not just the one it was planned on. This estimates the distribution of costs for each plan.

3) Aggregate the distribution of costs into a summary statistic (e.g. mean, CVaR). Select the plan with the best aggregated cost.

4) Optionally evaluate multiple parameters like speed profiles during path evaluation.

Main Contributions:

- Introduce the DREAMS algorithm that plans efficiently via determinization while still reasoning about uncertainty by using multiple world samples.

- Empirically demonstrate on a large dataset of long-range off-road planning problems that DREAMS achieves lower total cost compared to prior determinization methods.

- Show the ability of DREAMS to evaluate paths under different speed profiles during path evaluation to further optimize cost.

- Analyze the effect of parameters like number of sampled worlds and plans on algorithm performance.

In summary, the key insight is to leverage multiple world samples to get the efficiency of determinization while preserving the ability to reason about uncertainty across worlds for more robust planning.
