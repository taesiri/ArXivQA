# [AutoRT: Embodied Foundation Models for Large Scale Orchestration of   Robotic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a lack of diverse, real-world data for training robotic agents to perform manipulation tasks. Existing methods either collect data autonomously in constrained lab settings or rely heavily on human demonstrations which do not scale well. The key challenge is to build a system that can drive many robots to collect manipulation data in diverse real-world environments with minimal human supervision.

Proposed Solution - AutoRT: 
The paper proposes AutoRT, a system that leverages existing vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to propose and perform manipulation tasks on a fleet of 20+ mobile robots deployed across four office buildings over 7 months. 

The key components of AutoRT are:
1) Exploration and navigation to scenes using VLMs 
2) A "Robot Constitution" LLM that specifies safety rules and embodiment constraints
3) A VLM based scene description module  
4) An LLM based task proposal module that suggests feasible tasks given the scene
5) An LLM affordance filtering module that classifies which tasks are safe vs unsafe
6) Three data collection policies - teleoperation, a learned policy, and a scripted policy

The system allows scaling up robot deployment with minimal human supervision by mixing teleoperation and autonomous policies. It uses the Robot Constitution LLM to guide task safety and handles robot failures gracefully.


Main Contributions:
1) Proposes AutoRT, an LLM-driven system for large scale robot data collection that requires no environment map or prior on objects
2) Deploys system on 20+ mobile manipulators across 4 buildings over 7 months to collect 77k episodes 
3) Demonstrates AutoRT's ability to collect more visually and linguistically diverse data compared to prior dataset collection methods
4) Shows improvements on a real-world robot learning model when trained on AutoRT data
5) Introduces alignment of LLM-based robots to human preferences via constitutional prompting  

The work is a step towards utilizing foundation models to scale up robot learning through guided data collection, while also improving safety. Key limitations exist around model failures, data sparsity, and lack of safety guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 \methodname{} is a system that uses large language models and vision-language models to propose diverse robotic manipulation tasks and determine how to execute them on a fleet of real-world robots with minimal human supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing \methodname{}, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. Specifically, \methodname{} uses vision-language models for scene understanding and language models for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots, while reasoning about autonomy tradeoffs and safety. The paper demonstrates \methodname{} on over 20 robots across multiple buildings, collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies, and shows that the data collected is more diverse and can be used to improve robot learning models. A key innovation is the idea of an LLM-controlled robot constitution to align robot behavior to human preferences.

The key focus areas are leveraging foundation AI models to scale up real-world robot data collection and deployment, while introducing techniques to encourage safety and guide task proposals.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a "robot constitution" to guide safe task generation. How was this constitution designed and validated? What process was used to determine appropriate rules for task generation?

2. The visual diversity measurement uses k-means clustering on image embeddings. What value of k was chosen and why? Was any analysis done on the sensitivity of the diversity measurement to this hyperparameter? 

3. The paper claims the method can be applied to "completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision". What exactly constitutes "minimal" human supervision here? Quantitatively, what is the amount of human effort required?

4. What specific changes were made to the RT-1 model architecture and training procedure when doing model fine-tuning experiments? Were any hyperparameters tuned or was the default setup used? 

5. The language diversity measurement uses average L2 distance between sentence embeddings. Was any other diversity metric considered or analyzed, such as vocabulary overlap, syntactic differences, etc?

6. The method description focuses on manipulation tasks, but mentions the system could generalize to other embodiments. What modifications would be needed to apply this method to a purely mobile robot for navigation tasks?

7. What safety procedures or backup systems are used during fully autonomous operation periods? What plans are in place to handle complete system failures with multiple physically embodied robots?

8. What criteria are used during the affordance step to determine which collect policy to assign to a given task? Does it simply pattern match based on the prompt examples?

9. The peak simultaneous robot load was 20 robots. What factors limited further scaling? Would the proposed system architecture allow scaling to even larger numbers of robots? 

10. For the model fine-tuning experiments, only two target skills were evaluated (picking from different heights and wiping). Why were these specific skills chosen to showcase improvement? How were these determined to be skills the RT-1 model was weak at?
