# [From Visual Prompt Learning to Zero-Shot Transfer: Mapping Is All You   Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05266)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an effective mapping strategy to better adapt large pre-trained visual models to downstream tasks through visual prompt learning?The key points are:- Previous visual prompt learning methods have focused on designing good prompts, but neglected the importance of the mapping strategy which maps the output of the pre-trained model to the target labels. - The paper argues that compared to prompt design, a good mapping strategy matters more for the performance of visual prompt learning.- They propose SemAP, a semantics-based mapping method, that explores the semantic alignment between the pre-trained and downstream tasks. This allows transferring knowledge more effectively.- SemAP is evaluated on visual prompt learning tasks and demonstrates superior performance over previous mapping strategies like random mapping and frequency mapping.- Moreover, SemAP can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer without any fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for efficient adaptation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that semantics-based mapping is crucial for visual prompt learning, and the paper aims to demonstrate this through the design and evaluation of the proposed SemAP method. The key innovation is in identifying mapping as the core challenge and leveraging semantic similarities to enable effective knowledge transfer.
