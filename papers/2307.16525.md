# [Transferable Decoding with Visual Entities for Zero-Shot Image   Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16525)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How to effectively adapt large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP and large language models (LLMs) like GPT into the generative task of zero-shot image captioning while maintaining strong generalization ability?Specifically, the authors identify two key challenges when combining VLMs and LLMs for zero-shot image captioning:1) Modality bias: The language priors in LLMs tend to dominate, resulting in generated captions that are unrelated to the image content. 2) Object hallucination: The soft visual prompts learned from limited training data cause the model to hallucinate objects that do not exist in unseen test images.To address these issues, the paper proposes an entity-aware decoding approach called ViECap that incorporates explicit entity-aware hard prompts to guide the LLM's attention to visual entities actually present in the image. This is aimed at improving the transferability and generalization ability of zero-shot captioning models to novel test images.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using entity-aware hard prompts to complement soft visual prompts can reduce modality bias and object hallucination issues in VLM+LLM based zero-shot image captioning. The proposed ViECap model is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here is a summary of the main contributions of this paper:- The paper sheds light on the underlying reasons behind the degraded generalizability when adapting pre-trained VLMs and LLMs into image-to-text generation tasks. Specifically, the authors identify two issues - modality bias and object hallucination - that appear when using CLIP and GPT for zero-shot image captioning.- To address these issues, the authors propose an entity-aware decoding approach called ViECap. The key idea is to incorporate entity-aware hard prompts, constructed using nouns extracted from text or entities retrieved from images via CLIP, to guide the language model GPT-2 during caption generation. This allows attending to both seen and unseen entities. - The authors introduce an entity masking strategy to prevent ViECap from learning a trivial copy-paste shortcut during training when integrating entity-aware hard prompts.- Extensive experiments demonstrate ViECap's state-of-the-art cross-domain transferability in zero-shot image captioning as well as competitive performance in in-domain captioning compared to previous methods. ViECap also proves to be data-efficient.In summary, the main contributions are identifying issues that limit pre-trained model adaptation, proposing entity-aware decoding to address these issues, and providing extensive empirical evidence showing ViECap's effectiveness for zero-shot image captioning across diverse scenarios.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes ViECap, a zero-shot image captioning method that leverages entity-aware decoding with hard prompts constructed using nouns extracted from text and soft prompts from the CLIP text encoder, along with an entity masking strategy, to generate more coherent and accurate image captions, especially for out-of-domain images containing novel objects.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares and contrasts with other research in the field of zero-shot image captioning:- Builds on early-guidance decoding methods like CapDec and DeCap but proposes incorporating entity-aware hard prompts to reduce object hallucination and improve transferability to novel objects/domains. Most prior work uses only soft, learned prompts.  - Achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain/transferable captioning settings while remaining competitive for in-domain captioning. Demonstrates much better generalization to unseen domains than comparable methods.- Requires only text-based training, eliminating the need for paired image-text data like many existing methods. This makes it more efficient and scalable.- Leverages CLIP's embedding space for both prompting the language model during decoding and for entity retrieval/classification. Builds on the observation that CLIP can accurately classify novel entities. - Introduces a simple but effective entity masking strategy during training to prevent the model from learning a naive copy-paste behavior and improve generalizability.- Performs extensive experiments demonstrating improvements in novelty, transferability, and low-data scenarios compared to prior arts. Sets new SOTA in the zero-shot transferable setting.- Provides analysis and insights into issues like modality bias and object hallucination that arise when adapting large pre-trained VLMs/LLMs to generative image captioning.Overall, the key novelty is the use of entity-aware hard prompts to improve generalization to new domains while retaining competitive performance in-domain. The work demonstrates state-of-the-art transferable captioning with minimal paired supervision.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more effective methods to bridge the modality gap between the text and image domains when adapting pre-trained vision-language models to generative downstream tasks. The authors note there is still room for improvement here to further reduce modality bias.- Exploring different ways to incorporate visual semantics into the decoding process for image captioning. The entity-aware hard prompts used in this work are one approach, but the authors suggest investigating other techniques as well.- Scaling up the model size and training datasets to take advantage of larger pre-trained vision-language and language models. The authors show performance gains from using larger language models, indicating there is potential for further improvement.- Extending the idea of entity-aware decoding to other multimodal generative tasks beyond image captioning, such as visual question answering, visual dialogue, etc. The concept could potentially improve coherence and reduce hallucination in those areas too.- Developing methods that can dynamically adjust the integration of visual semantics based on the image contents. This could further improve generalizability across diverse images and captioning scenarios.- Exploring unsupervised or self-supervised training techniques to reduce reliance on annotated image-text datasets. This could improve data efficiency.In general, the authors highlight the need for more research into effectively adapting large pre-trained models to multimodal generative tasks in order to improve coherence, reduce bias, and enhance generalizability - particularly in zero-shot transfer settings. Their work provides a good foundation in that direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes ViECap, a transferable decoding model for zero-shot image captioning. Recent methods combining large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP with large language models (LLMs) for image captioning suffer from modality bias (language prior dominates) and object hallucination (describing objects not in the image). ViECap addresses these issues by incorporating entity-aware hard prompts, constructed using nouns extracted from sentences, to guide the LLM's attention to visual entities actually present. A simple but effective random entity masking strategy is introduced during training to avoid a copy-paste shortcut and improve generalization. For inference, entities are detected from the image using CLIP's strong zero-shot classification capability. Experiments demonstrate ViECap significantly outperforms prior text-only methods, especially in cross-domain transfer settings with novel images. The model is also shown to be data-efficient and generate captions in diverse styles. Key advantages are strong transferability from hard prompts and entity masking enhancing generalization.
