## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Cost Aware Poisoning Attack (CA-attack) framework to improve the efficacy of graph poisoning attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs). The key insight is that existing attack losses waste budget on nodes that are already misclassified or very resilient. To address this inefficiency, the CA-attack loss dynamically reweights each node based on its classification margin, prioritizing nodes with smaller positive margins while postponing nodes with negative margins. Specifically, the attack loss applies an exponential decay function on the margins to assign higher weights to more vulnerable nodes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the CA-attack combined with common attack losses significantly enhances performance over state-of-the-art methods. The gains highlight the attack budget efficiency of the CA framework. Moreover, the proposed technique can serve as a universal boosting plugin that is broadly compatible with existing attack strategies. The computational overhead introduced is marginal compared to the performance improvements. In conclusion, the CA-attack provides an effective way to optimize the allocation of limited attack budget against GNNs.
