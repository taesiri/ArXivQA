# [Incremental hierarchical text clustering methods: a review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
With the growth of internet usage and available data, there is a need for automatic and efficient organization of text documents to facilitate search and analysis. Hierarchical and incremental clustering techniques can help organize dynamic text data into evolving hierarchical structures to meet this need. However, there are still many challenges and open questions around developing optimal techniques.

Solution:
This paper conducts a systematic literature review of recent research between 2010-2018 on incremental hierarchical text clustering techniques. 31 relevant papers are analyzed - 17 proposing new techniques and 14 applying clustering techniques in domains like news, health, and social media.

The key aspects analyzed across the 17 papers proposing new techniques include:
- Similarity measures used like cosine similarity and Euclidean distance
- Datasets used like Reuters-21578 and 20 Newsgroups
- Evaluation metrics like Overall F-Measure and F-Cubed 
- Baseline algorithms compared against like k-means and UPGMA

Contributions:
- Provides a comprehensive review of recent research in incremental hierarchical text clustering
- Summarizes and compares key aspects like similarity measures, datasets, evaluation metrics across 17 papers on new techniques
- Analyzes differences and common objectives across techniques on generating quality hierarchies, navigable hierarchies, handling dynamic data etc.
- Discusses open challenges and need for comparative studies between algorithms for this problem.

In summary, this thorough literature review structures and analyzes the latest research in incremental hierarchical text clustering to provide insights into the state of art and future research directions needed.
