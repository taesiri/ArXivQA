# [Accelerating prototype selection with spatial abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prototype selection techniques have been used to reduce dataset sizes and computational requirements for machine learning models. However, most existing prototype selection algorithms have high execution times which poses challenges for large datasets. Therefore, there is a need for approaches to accelerate prototype selection algorithms while maintaining accuracy.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel approach called PSASA (Prototype Selection Accelerator based on Spatial Abstraction) to speed up existing prototype selection algorithms. The key ideas are:

1) Spatial abstraction: Split the dataset into spatial partitions (hyperrectangles) and create a prototype (centroid) for each set of instances of the same class within each partition. This spatial abstraction efficiently reduces search space.

2) Pipeline architecture: Use PSASA for initial prototype selection, followed by a conventional prototype selection algorithm for refinement. As PSASA reduces search space, this speeds up conventional algorithms.

Main Contributions:

- Novel idea of using spatial abstraction as a pre-processing step to accelerate conventional prototype selection algorithms

- Experimental analysis with 5 prototype selection algorithms on 14 datasets showing PSASA reduces running time while maintaining accuracy and reduction rate  

- Demonstrates effectiveness as a general approach - maintains or improves accuracy for majority of datasets and algorithms

- Analysis of impact of key parameter n on accuracy, reduction rate and running time

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution by proposing an efficient way to enable conventional prototype selection algorithms to scale to large datasets by reducing their execution times. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the PSASA approach.
