# [Optimisation of photodetectors design: comparison between Montecarlo and   Genetic Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing optical detectors with stringent specifications like high signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth is challenging. Using a trial-and-error approach to select design parameter values is often not sufficient to achieve optimal performance. 

- An accurate quantitative evaluation of design performance and systematic optimisation of parameters is needed.

Solution:
- Propose a general photodetector design methodology using a merit function to evaluate performance and Monte Carlo or Genetic Algorithm optimisation. 

- Define design parameters as feedback resistance/capacitance and photodiode bias voltage. Performance variables are signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, phase margin.

- Introduce unilateral and bilateral merit functions to quantify compliance to specs for each performance variable. Global merit combines individual merits.

Optimisation Algorithms:

Monte Carlo:
- Randomly sample design parameter value combinations and select the set giving maximum global merit. 

- Monte Carlo optimisation uses far fewer evaluations than exhaustive systematic search and yet achieves merits within 10% of optimal.

Genetic Algorithm:  
- Evolves population of design parameter sets (chromosomes) over generations based on merit. Applies selection, recombination and mutation operators.

- Achieves merits within 2.4% of optimal with only 0.8% evaluations needed by systematic search. Scaling laws for convergence are superior to Monte Carlo.

Conclusion:
- Merit-based Monte Carlo or Genetic Algorithm optimisation enables efficient photodetector design automation with near globally optimal performance.

- Genetic Algorithm, though slower, outperforms Monte Carlo significantly in accuracy vs evaluations. Applicable to more complex multi-parameter optimisation problems.
