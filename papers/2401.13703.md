# [Solving Some Geometry Problems of the Náboj 2023 Contest with   Automated Deduction in GeoGebra Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Geometry problems from math contests like Náboj require symbolic computations to derive exact, non-trivial solutions. Software tools like GeoGebra provide great visualization but limited symbolic support.
- The paper explores using GeoGebra Discovery, a fork of GeoGebra with automated deduction algorithms, to solve some of the geometry problems from the Náboj 2023 contest.

Proposed Solution: 
- Demonstrate GeoGebra Discovery's capability to solve 4 of the Náboj problems that require symbolic analysis to derive exact solutions. These include problems related to squares, pentominos, triangles and circles.
- For each problem, the construction protocol in GeoGebra Discovery is provided to show the step-by-step approach to model and solve it.
- Analyze other problems from Náboj 2023 that cannot yet be fully solved by GeoGebra Discovery and propose extensions needed - including better support for angles, areas, implicit assumptions.

Main Contributions:
- Showcases the potential of using automated deduction algorithms to solve geometry problems that require symbolic computations.
- Provides constructive analysis and feedback on current capabilities and limitations of GeoGebra Discovery.
- Proposes specific improvements like angle and area computations that would allow more geometry contest problems to be tackled.
- Overall, makes a case for incorporating symbolic analysis in geometric toolkits to expand math problem-solving abilities.

In summary, the paper demonstrates using GeoGebra Discovery to solve select geometry contest problems and analyzes how to further boost its deduction capabilities to make more such problems tractable.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the Recio-Vélez method used in GeoGebra Discovery incorporate symbolic computations to derive geometrical proofs in the background? What are some of the key steps it takes to eliminate variables and arrive at solutions symbolically?

2) The paper mentions that full angle and area support is currently limited in GeoGebra Discovery. What specific symbolic computation capabilities would need to be added to enable more robust angle and area calculations? 

3) One of the goals mentioned is to make competitive math contest problems more tractable. What other symbolic computation features beyond angles and areas would be most helpful for parsing and solving additional classes of problems from contests like Náboj?

4) How does the symbolic analysis differ when constructing the three squares versus simplifying the construction to just use the reflection points in the solution for Problem 6? What are the tradeoffs?

5) For Problem 25, the paper shows how locus equations with angles could help arrive at the solution. What is the underlying challenge in incorporating angles symbolically and how might that be overcome? 

6) The incorrect conjecture for Problem 58 highlights issues with numerical approximations versus exact symbolic solutions. How can the system better detect and avoid such subtle numeric mismatches in the future?

7) What additional checks or constraints could be added to GeoGebra Discovery's symbolic engine to avoid generating false proofs or degenerate cases when problems have multiple solutions? 

8) How does the complexity of the algebraic derivations scale as constructions get more intricate? Are there opportunities to simplify or optimize the computations?

9) Could machine learning be leveraged to help auto-generate the construction steps and derive solutions more efficiently for certain problem classes?

10) The paper focuses on competitive math problems, but what other potential application domains could benefit from GeoGebra Discovery's underlying symbolic computation capabilities?
