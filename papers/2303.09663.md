# [Efficient Computation Sharing for Multi-Task Visual Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09663)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform multiple visual scene understanding tasks efficiently from a single input image or video stream. Specifically, the paper aims to reduce the computational redundancy that arises when using separate models for each task. The key hypothesis is that an efficient multi-task learning approach can be developed that balances accuracy and efficiency by:1) Leveraging individually-trained single-task models to maintain performance.2) Sharing parameters and activations across tasks using a novel computation sharing scheme to reduce redundancy.3) Exploiting sparsity in the temporal domain for video inputs to further reduce computation. The overall goal is to reduce the computational and memory costs of multi-task learning for visual scene understanding without sacrificing accuracy. The paper presents a method that shares weights and activations across tasks and time using regularization techniques to induce sparsity. This is hypothesized to significantly reduce model complexity while achieving comparable or improved accuracy over prior multi-task learning techniques.In summary, the central research question is how to develop an efficient yet accurate approach for multi-task visual scene understanding. The key hypothesis is that substantial computation and memory savings can be attained through a sparse parameter and activation sharing scheme across tasks and time while maintaining accuracy.
