# [Efficient Computation Sharing for Multi-Task Visual Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09663)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform multiple visual scene understanding tasks efficiently from a single input image or video stream. Specifically, the paper aims to reduce the computational redundancy that arises when using separate models for each task. 

The key hypothesis is that an efficient multi-task learning approach can be developed that balances accuracy and efficiency by:

1) Leveraging individually-trained single-task models to maintain performance.

2) Sharing parameters and activations across tasks using a novel computation sharing scheme to reduce redundancy.

3) Exploiting sparsity in the temporal domain for video inputs to further reduce computation. 

The overall goal is to reduce the computational and memory costs of multi-task learning for visual scene understanding without sacrificing accuracy. The paper presents a method that shares weights and activations across tasks and time using regularization techniques to induce sparsity. This is hypothesized to significantly reduce model complexity while achieving comparable or improved accuracy over prior multi-task learning techniques.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop an efficient yet accurate approach for multi-task visual scene understanding. The key hypothesis is that substantial computation and memory savings can be attained through a sparse parameter and activation sharing scheme across tasks and time while maintaining accuracy.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents an efficient multi-task learning approach that shares computations and parameters across tasks and over time for dense visual scene understanding using transformer models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to related work in multi-task learning for visual scene understanding:

- The paper builds off recent work in using transformer models like ViT and Swin for multi-task dense prediction problems. It cites several recent papers that have explored transformer-based multi-task learning, including InvPT, which serves as a strong baseline in the experiments.

- Compared to typical multi-task learning approaches that jointly optimize all tasks in a single model, this paper takes a different approach of training independent single-task models and introducing a novel computation/parameter sharing scheme. This is motivated by limitations of joint multi-task learning like task imbalance. 

- For parameter sharing, the paper adapts recent techniques like Diff-Pruning from the transfer learning literature to enable weight sharing between the base and sub-tasks models. This differs from standard multi-task learning that would fully share parameters.

- The main novelty is extending these parameter sharing ideas to also share activations/computation between tasks and temporal frames. This is achieved by learning sparse delta activation matrices.

- Most prior work has focused on architectural designs for improving multi-task interaction. This paper focuses more on the computational aspects to balance accuracy and efficiency.

- Experiments show this approach can outperform joint multi-task learning baselines like InvPT in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The FLOPs and parameters are reduced substantially compared to independent single-task models.

- The temporal extension to video frames is also novel, as most prior work has focused on single image multi-task learning. This further reduces computation by sharing across time.

In summary, the key distinction of this work is moving from joint multi-task learning to an efficient single-task based approach with intelligent sharing of parameters and computation. The results demonstrate the potential of this direction to get the best of both worlds - maintaining accuracy while improving efficiency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several potential future research directions:

- Developing a sparsity-aware transformer accelerator for quantifying the true speedup achieved by the proposed approach. Since the method relies on sparse matrix-matrix multiplications, measuring the actual runtime speedup requires specialized hardware that can exploit sparsity. The authors acknowledge that FLOPs may not fully represent the real speed gains.

- Extending the method to other vision tasks beyond semantic segmentation, depth estimation, etc. The proposed framework is generic and could likely be applied to other pixel-level prediction tasks.

- Evaluating the approach on more complex and diverse datasets. The experiments focused on NYUD-v2 and Pascal Context datasets. Testing on more challenging and varied benchmarks would better demonstrate scalability. 

- Improving the strategy for combining temporal and task domain activation sharing. The paper uses a simple heuristic based on sparsity ratios. More advanced techniques could be developed to optimize reuse across domains.

- Reducing the memory overhead of storing intermediate activations. The method requires storing activations from the base task and previous frames, which increases memory costs. Compression or approximate storage techniques could help address this.

- Applying the ideas to other model architectures besides vision transformers. The core concepts around reusing activations and weights could extend to CNNs or other backbone networks.

- Exploring multi-GPU distributed training for the approach to accelerate training time. The current training process is time-consuming, particularly on large datasets. Leveraging distributed data parallelism could help scale training.

In summary, the primary future works are developing specialized hardware accelerators for the method, expanding to more tasks and datasets, improving domain combination strategies, reducing memory costs, applying to other architectures, and distributed training. Overall, the paper sets up a solid foundation and framework for future research to build upon.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method for performing multiple visual scene understanding tasks concurrently using transformer models. It divides the tasks into a base task and sub-tasks. Then it applies a computation and parameter sharing strategy, reusing weights and activations from the base task when training the sub-tasks. This is done by learning sparse delta weight and delta activation matrices for each sub-task to remove inter-task redundancies. The approach is further extended to video inputs by sharing across temporal frames. Experiments on PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency versus prior multi-task learning techniques.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel computation- and parameter-sharing scheme for efficiently performing multiple visual tasks on the same input image using transformer models. The key idea involves splitting the desired tasks into a base task and sub-tasks. The base task model is trained independently, while the sub-task models reuse activations and weights from the base task. Specifically, the sub-task models learn sparse delta weight matrices and delta activations relative to the base task through L0 and L1 regularization. This allows most of the computation from the base task to be reused for the sub-tasks, significantly reducing overall complexity. The method is further extended to video inputs by exploiting temporal redundancy between frames to minimize computations across both task and temporal domains.

The proposed approach is evaluated on the NYUD-v2 and Pascal-Context datasets for multiple visual tasks including segmentation, depth estimation and surface normal prediction. Results demonstrate superior performance over prior multi-task learning techniques like InvPT, with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs. For example, on Pascal-Context the method reduces FLOPs by 49.4% and parameters by 74% over independent single-task models. The technique is also shown to be effective for video streams, reusing activations across frames to further reduce complexity. Overall, the paper presents an efficient yet accurate approach for multi-task visual understanding that balances performance and complexity.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for efficient computation sharing across multiple visual scene understanding tasks on the same input image or video. The key ideas are:

1) Split tasks into a base task and sub-tasks. Train a single network for the base task and reuse its weights and activations to train the sub-tasks. 

2) Represent sub-task weights as the sum of base weights and a sparse delta weight matrix. Apply L0 regularization on delta weights to encourage sparsity. 

3) Introduce a delta task activation matrix between base and sub-task activations. Apply L1 regularization on delta task activations to remove inter-task redundancies and enable activation sharing from base to sub-tasks.

4) Similarly, apply L1 regularization on delta temporal activations between consecutive frames to enable temporal activation sharing within each task. 

5) Strategically combine task and temporal activation sharing for maximum computation savings. Task activation reuse is used for initial layers while temporal activation reuse is favored for later layers.

Overall, the method achieves superior performance compared to multi-task learning baselines while significantly reducing computation and parameters by reusing activations and learning sparse weight/activation differences between tasks and across time.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper presents a method for efficient multi-task visual scene understanding. Specifically, it aims to address the following problems/questions:

- Performing multiple visual tasks (e.g. semantic segmentation, depth estimation) concurrently using individual models can be computationally expensive and memory intensive. How can we reduce this redundancy and improve efficiency?

- Multi-task learning can improve efficiency by sharing representations across tasks but often struggles to balance performance across tasks. How can we get the benefits of multi-task learning while maintaining good performance on each task? 

- Multi-task learning requires ground truth labels for all tasks on the same data, limiting flexibility. How can we make multi-task learning more flexible to add/remove tasks?

- For video inputs, how can we further reduce computation by reusing information across both the task and temporal domain?

To address these issues, the paper proposes a computation and parameter sharing approach that is motivated by transfer learning. The key ideas are:

- Split tasks into a base task and sub-tasks, train them independently.

- Also share activations from base task to sub-tasks using sparse delta activation matrices.

- Extend to video by reusing activations temporally within each (sub)task.

- Combining task and temporal activation reuse maximizes efficiency.

The approach aims to get the efficiency benefits of multi-task learning while overcoming some of its limitations by building on single-task networks. Experiments show improved efficiency and accuracy over multi-task baselines.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel computation and parameter sharing scheme for transformer-based multi-task learning in visual scene understanding. The key idea is to split the tasks into a base task and sub-tasks, then train them separately but share weights and activations between the base and sub-tasks to reduce redundancy. Specifically, the weights of the sub-tasks are represented as a sparse delta weight matrix added to the base task weights.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel computation and parameter sharing scheme for transformer-based multi-task learning of concurrent visual tasks from the same input image or video frames. The key idea is to divide the tasks into a base task and sub-tasks, where the base task is trained independently and the sub-tasks reuse the weights and activations from the base task. Specifically, the weights of the sub-tasks are represented as a sparse difference (delta) from the base task weights. The activations are also made sparse by forcing the difference between base and sub-task activations to be sparse via L1 regularization. As a result, sub-tasks can reuse activations from the base task, only requiring sparse matrix multiplications for the delta weights and activations. This significantly reduces computation and storage requirements compared to independent single-task learning. For video inputs, temporal redundancy is further exploited by reusing activations across frames. Evaluations on PASCAL Context and NYUDv2 datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency over prior multi-task learning techniques.
