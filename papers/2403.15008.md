# [Tri-Perspective View Decomposition for Geometry-Aware Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Depth completion, the task of generating a dense depth map from a sparse depth input, is important for many applications like 3D reconstruction, autonomous driving, etc. However, existing methods either rely only on 2D representations lacking precise 3D geometry or directly use raw 3D point clouds which are extremely sparse and have varying point distributions at different distances. These limitations make depth completion challenging.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called "Tri-Perspective View Decomposition (TPVD)" that decomposes the raw 3D point cloud into three 2D views - top, front and side. The key ideas are:

1) The sparse depth input is included in the front view. This allows TPVD to densify the sparse input in 2D space using 2D convolutions while retaining 3D geometry. 

2) A recurrent 2D-3D-2D "TPV Fusion" scheme is designed to leverage 3D geometric priors more effectively. The 2D views predict more valid pixels to provide denser points to the 3D process. The 3D process captures geometry using a newly proposed "Distance-Aware Spherical Convolution (DASC)" that handles varying point distributions and feeds it back to the 2D process.

3) A "Geometric Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN)" is incorporated to further improve geometric consistency by constructing affinitive neighbors simultaneously in 2D TPV spaces and their 3D projection space.

Main Contributions:

1) A new framework, TPVD, that completes depth in 2D while retaining 3D geometric priors via point cloud decomposition.

2) TPV Fusion scheme utilizing recurrent 2D-3D-2D interaction and DASC to leverage 3D geometry effectively.

3) GSPN for fine-grained 3D geometric refinement using joint 2D and 3D affinity learning.  

4) A new smartphone-based depth completion dataset, TOFDC, captured using TOF sensor and color camera.

Results:
TPVD achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, NYUv2, SUN RGBD and the new TOFDC dataset, outperforming existing 2D and 2D-3D methods. This demonstrates its ability to produce high quality dense depth with accurate 3D geometry.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel tri-perspective view decomposition framework for depth completion that effectively leverages 3D geometric information by recurrently interacting between projected 2D views and aggregated 3D representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel framework called tri-perspective view decomposition (TPVD), which decomposes the 3D point cloud into three 2D views to densify sparse depth measurements while preserving 3D geometry. 

2. It designs a TPV Fusion scheme to leverage 3D geometric priors effectively via recurrent 2D-3D-2D aggregation, where a distance-aware spherical convolution (DASC) is applied to handle the varying distributions of LiDAR points.

3. It presents a geometric spatial propagation network (GSPN) to further improve the geometric consistency by constructing affinitive neighbors simultaneously in the three decomposed 2D TPV spaces and their joint 3D projection space.

4. It builds a new smartphone-based depth completion dataset named TOFDC using time-of-flight sensors and color cameras.
