# [On Latency Predictors for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) relies on fast and accurate latency predictors to guide the search process. However, existing latency predictors have several limitations:
  - High variance and instability during few-shot transfer to new devices
  - Lack of a standardized set of hardware devices and tasks for evaluation
  - Use of cherry-picked or correlated device splits, making results less generalizable
  - Limited investigations into optimal predictor architecture and input representations

Proposed Solutions:
- Introduce an automated algorithm to partition available hardware devices into train/test sets with low correlation, enabling unbiased evaluation
- Systematically investigate design choices for latency predictors:
  - Study methods to better sample diverse NN architectures for few-shot transfer
  - Propose operation-specific hardware embeddings to capture hardware interactions
  - Evaluate multiple supplementary NN encodings (e.g. Arch2Vec, CATE) 
  - Design an end-to-end latency predictor architecture combining optimized components
- Present NAS-Flat, an improved latency predictor utilizing the best designs from the studies
  
Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of latency predictor components on a principled set of hardware tasks
- Introduction of operation-specific hardware embeddings to model hardware optimizations
- Evaluation of NN encoding techniques for few-shot transfer sample selection
- New end-to-end latency predictor NAS-Flat which achieves state-of-the-art results on 11 of 12 hardware tasks
- Demonstration of improved sample efficiency, leading to 5.8x faster NAS wall-clock time compared to prior art

In summary, the paper provides an extensive set of studies to understand and improve latency predictors for hardware-aware NAS. The optimized NAS-Flat latency predictor and general evaluation framework are key outcomes that can enable more efficient and reliable automated architecture search.
