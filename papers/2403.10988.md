# [Boosting Flow-based Generative Super-Resolution Models via Learned Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10988)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies several key challenges with existing flow-based super-resolution (SR) models:
1) Grid artifacts - Discontinuities in image textures leading to a checkerboard pattern. This is caused by adjacent image patches being sampled independently in patch-based models.  
2) Exploding inverses - Occurrence of infinite values during the inversion process of normalizing flows, leading to noisy image patches.
3) Suboptimal performance - Using a fixed sampling temperature is not optimal, as ideal settings vary across image regions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework to address these issues by introducing a "learned prior" module that predicts a latent code conditioned on the input image. This latent code is then fed to the flow model to generate the SR image. The key aspects are:

1) The module extracts features from both the image space and the latent space of an initial prior (upsampled LR image). This captures correlations between patches to reduce discontinuities.

2) The predicted latent code avoids being out-of-distribution, preventing exploding inverses in the flow model.

3) The code is generated by a model rather than random sampling, eliminating the need for a predefined temperature.

The framework can be integrated with any existing flow-based SR model without modifying weights or architectures. Experiments are shown with both fixed-scale and arbitrary-scale models.


Main Contributions:

1) Identifies three key deficiencies in flow-based SR models. 

2) Proposes a learned prior framework to address these, through a flexible latent module architecture.

3) Achieves simultaneous improvements in fidelity and perceptual quality over state-of-the-art flow-based SR models.

4) Demonstrates generalizability by enhancing both fixed-scale and arbitrary-scale models without customization.

5) Extensive ablation studies analyze design choices and quantify the sources of improvements.
