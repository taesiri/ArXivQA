# [Consistency Prototype Module and Motion Compensation for Few-Shot Action   Recognition (CLIP-CP$\mathbf{M^2}$C)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses several key challenges in few-shot action recognition:
1) Existing works rely mainly on visual mono-modal features which have limited samples to model video distribution. 
2) Multi-modal methods can use label text to enhance prototypes but cannot acquire label text for query videos during testing. This causes an information imbalance.
3) Most works ignore motion features which are essential for distinguishing actions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Consistency Prototype and Motion Compensation network (CLIP-CPM2C) to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1) Use CLIP for multi-modal learning with text-image comparison for domain adaptation from image-text to video-text.

2) Propose a Consistency Prototype Module (CPM) to generate "fake" query prompts during testing using a random vector, while still using real prompts for support set. This is enabled via a consistency loss during training to align representations. 

3) Introduce a motion compensation mechanism to explicitly model motion dynamics by using differential features between adjacent frames. CPM is applied on motion features as well.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to use fake prompt embeddings for query videos in CLIP-based few-shot action recognition. This balances information between prototype and query.

2) Novel CPM method to align representations between real and fake prompts via consistency loss. Allows compensating for missing query prompts.

3) First incorporation of motion features into CLIP-based few-shot action recognition via differential frame features.

4) State-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks (HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics, Something-Something).

In summary, the paper proposes an elegant solution using consistency learning and motion modeling to advance multi-modal few-shot action recognition. The CPM with fake prompts is a simple but powerful idea to balance prototype and query information.
