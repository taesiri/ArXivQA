# [Consistency Prototype Module and Motion Compensation for Few-Shot Action   Recognition (CLIP-CP$\mathbf{M^2}$C)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses several key challenges in few-shot action recognition:
1) Existing works rely mainly on visual mono-modal features which have limited samples to model video distribution. 
2) Multi-modal methods can use label text to enhance prototypes but cannot acquire label text for query videos during testing. This causes an information imbalance.
3) Most works ignore motion features which are essential for distinguishing actions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Consistency Prototype and Motion Compensation network (CLIP-CPM2C) to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1) Use CLIP for multi-modal learning with text-image comparison for domain adaptation from image-text to video-text.

2) Propose a Consistency Prototype Module (CPM) to generate "fake" query prompts during testing using a random vector, while still using real prompts for support set. This is enabled via a consistency loss during training to align representations. 

3) Introduce a motion compensation mechanism to explicitly model motion dynamics by using differential features between adjacent frames. CPM is applied on motion features as well.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to use fake prompt embeddings for query videos in CLIP-based few-shot action recognition. This balances information between prototype and query.

2) Novel CPM method to align representations between real and fake prompts via consistency loss. Allows compensating for missing query prompts.

3) First incorporation of motion features into CLIP-based few-shot action recognition via differential frame features.

4) State-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks (HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics, Something-Something).

In summary, the paper proposes an elegant solution using consistency learning and motion modeling to advance multi-modal few-shot action recognition. The CPM with fake prompts is a simple but powerful idea to balance prototype and query information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a few-shot action recognition model called CLIP-CPM^2C that uses a consistency prototype module and motion compensation with CLIP to effectively utilize multi-modal information and improve recognition accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Consistency Prototype Module (CPM) to generate consistent representations for support and query videos using both real and fake (random vector) prompt embeddings along with visual features. This allows utilizing prompt information for queries where real prompts are not available at test time.

2. It introduces a motion compensation (MC) mechanism to extract discriminative motion features between adjacent frames to supplement normal frame features. 

3. It applies consistency losses for both normal and motion features to bring their real and fake labeled representations closer.

4. It performs experiments on 5 datasets - HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics, Something-Something V2 (full and small) which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed CLIP-CPM^2C model compared to previous methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel CPM module along with motion compensation to effectively utilize prompt information and extract discriminative spatio-temporal representations for few-shot action recognition. The extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Few-shot action recognition - The paper focuses on few-shot action recognition, which aims to recognize novel action categories from just a few labeled video examples.

- Multi-modal - The proposed model utilizes both visual features from video frames as well as text features from action category labels/prompts, making it a multi-modal approach. 

- CLIP - The backbone of the model is the CLIP image-text matching model which provides the visual and text encoders.

- Consistency Prototype Module (CPM) - A key contribution is the proposed CPM module which uses a consistency loss to make a random vector able to effectively replace real label prompts.

- Motion Compensation (MC) - The paper also introduces motion features extracted using frame differencing as a complement to normal visual features.

- Domain Adaptation - Text-video domain adaptation is performed using CLIP's image-text matching objective.

So in summary, key terms revolve around few-shot action recognition, multi-modal learning with CLIP, the CPM and MC modules, and domain adaptation to video.
