# [Off-Policy Evaluation of Slate Bandit Policies via Optimizing   Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in slate contextual bandits, where the action space consists of multi-dimensional slates (combinations of sub-actions). This problem arises frequently in recommender systems, search engines, marketing etc. The key challenge is that existing estimators like Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) suffer from exponentially high variance due to large slate action spaces. The Pseudo-Inverse (PI) estimator reduces variance by assuming linearity of rewards, but has bias if this assumption is violated. Thus, effective OPE for slate bandits remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a novel OPE estimator called Latent IPS (LIPS), which defines importance weights in a low-dimensional latent slate space. Specifically, LIPS learns a slate abstraction mapping that aggregates slates into this lower-dimensional latent space. The importance weights are then computed between policies' distributions over this abstract slate space to enable substantial variance reduction. 

The paper shows theoretically that LIPS is unbiased under a sufficient abstraction, and establishes finite sample bounds on its bias and variance. Based on an analysis showing potential improvements from an insufficient abstraction, an optimization procedure is presented to directly minimize LIPS's MSE by balancing bias and variance. This involves learning the slate abstraction, while reconstructing original slates and rewards.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of LIPS - the first OPE estimator leveraging slate abstractions to significantly reduce variance for slate bandits
- Theoretical analysis of bias, variance and MSE tradeoff with abstraction optimization
- Fully data-driven procedure to obtain slate abstractions directly minimizing LIPS's MSE 
- Empirical evaluation demonstrating substantial improvements over IPS, PI and other baselines on real-world datasets

The main innovation is developing OPE for complex slate bandits by learning action abstractions rather than assuming reward structures. The optimization framework to strategically allow some bias while minimizing variance is also novel. By effectively tackling a challenging open problem, this work expands the applicability of OPE to complex interactive systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel off-policy evaluation method for slate bandits called Latent Inverse Propensity Scoring (LIPS), which leverages optimized slate abstractions to substantially reduce variance while minimizing bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimator called Latent IPS (LIPS) for evaluating slate bandit policies. LIPS defines importance weights in a low-dimensional slate abstraction space to reduce variance compared to standard IPS.

2. It provides theoretical analysis on the bias and variance properties of LIPS. The analysis shows that LIPS can be unbiased under a "sufficient" abstraction and demonstrates the variance reduction compared to IPS.

3. It also shows that the MSE of LIPS may be minimized by using an "insufficient" abstraction that strategically trades off some bias for greater variance reduction. 

4. The paper develops a data-driven optimization procedure to learn a slate abstraction that directly minimizes the MSE of LIPS, making it more robust than estimators like MIPS that assume useful embeddings already exist.

5. Empirical evaluation on real-world extreme classification datasets shows that LIPS outperforms existing estimators like IPS, PI, MIPS and their doubly robust variants in terms of MSE, especially for non-linear rewards and large slate spaces.

In summary, the key novelty is the LIPS estimator and its optimization framework to effectively leverage slate abstractions for variance reduction in off-policy evaluation of complex slate bandit policies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Off-policy evaluation (OPE): Estimating the performance of a new policy using data collected under a different logging policy. This is a central focus of the paper.

- Slate bandits: A multi-armed bandit setting where the agent selects a slate/set of actions at each round. The slate structure leads to a combinatorial action space. 

- Inverse propensity scoring (IPS): A standard off-policy evaluation method that uses importance sampling to correct for distribution shift. Suffers from high variance with large slate action spaces.

- Pseudo-inverse (PI) estimator: An estimator designed for slate bandits that assumes a linear reward structure. Lower variance than IPS but bias if linearity does not hold.

- Latent IPS (LIPS): The novel estimator proposed in this paper, which defines importance weights in a lower-dimensional latent slate abstraction space.

- Slate abstraction: The mapping of slates in the original action space to representations in a smaller latent space. Key to enabling lower variance in LIPS.

- Sufficient/insufficient abstraction: Whether the abstraction retains all information to characterize the expected rewards. Insufficient abstraction can further reduce variance.

- Optimizing abstraction: Proposed method to directly minimize estimator bias and variance by fitting the abstraction model.

So in summary, key concepts include off-policy evaluation, slate bandits, importance sampling estimators like IPS/PI/LIPS, slate abstraction space, and optimization of this abstraction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Latent IPS (LIPS) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes optimizing the abstraction function to directly minimize the MSE of LIPS. What are some potential challenges or limitations to this optimization procedure? For example, are there any issues with overfitting or availability of sufficient data?

2. How does the choice of parametrization for the abstraction function $p_\theta(z|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{s})$ impact the performance of LIPS? What types of parametrizations would be most suitable and why? 

3. Theoretical analysis shows that an insufficient abstraction can provide lower MSE for LIPS compared to a sufficient abstraction. What are some practical heuristics or validation methods during optimization to determine when an abstraction becomes insufficient?

4. How does the choice of discrete versus continuous abstraction space impact bias-variance tradeoffs for LIPS? What factors determine when one is preferred over the other?

5. What mechanisms allow LIPS to achieve lower variance than MIPS, which also relies on action embeddings? Is it solely the optimization procedure or are there other factors?

6. Theorem 3.3 provides an analytic expression quantifying the variance reduction achieved by LIPS. Can this result be leveraged to synthesize optimal abstractions or otherwise inform the optimization process? 

7. The loss function for optimizing abstractions includes terms for reconstruction, reward prediction, and regularization. What is the sensitivity of LIPS performance to the weighting between these terms?

8. How does the choice of logging policy $\pi_0$ impact the quality of abstractions that can be obtained from logged data? Are there assumptions on $\pi_0$ for the proposed optimization method?

9. The abstraction optimization method requires learning probabilistic models for reward and slate reconstruction. What alternative loss functions or model parameterizations could be appropriate?

10. What theoretical guarantees can be provided regarding the quality of abstractions produced by the proposed optimization technique? For example, can convergence or sample complexity results be established?
