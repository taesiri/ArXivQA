# [Leveraging Non-Decimated Wavelet Packet Features and Transformer Models   for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on improving time series forecasting performance by using wavelet analysis techniques to generate additional features, which are then fed into various machine learning models. Time series data is ubiquitous across many fields, but accurately forecasting future values is challenging, especially for non-stationary data. The authors argue that wavelets can capture useful multi-scale and temporal properties of time series that may improve forecasting accuracy when used alongside machine learning models.  

Key Contributions
The main contributions of this work are:

1) Evaluate Daubechies wavelets with different numbers of vanishing moments as features for both non-temporal (e.g. regression) and temporal forecasting models (e.g. RNNs). The wavelet is selected via cross-validation.

2) Compare using the non-decimated wavelet transform (NDWT) versus the non-decimated wavelet packet transform (NWPT) for generating wavelet features. The latter provides more coefficient vectors that may better capture signals.

3) Propose an online algorithm to compute NDWT and NWPT features that avoids leakage of future info into the features.

4) Evaluate wavelet features on a much wider range of forecasting methods than prior works, including latest deep learning models like Transformers.

5) Demonstrate improved 1-step and multi-step forecast accuracy on real and synthetic datasets when using wavelet features compared to just lags for most models.

Proposed Solution
The authors leverage NDWT and NWPT to generate multiple wavelet coefficient vectors from time series, using an online algorithm that prevents future data leakage. Dimensionality reduction via ridge regression or PCA is used to select the most relevant vectors as additional features for forecasting models like RNNs, Transformers etc. Models are trained in a rolling manner and tuned via cross-validation.

Key Results
- For 1-step forecasting, wavelet features outperform lag features for all non-temporal models, with over 30% SMAPE reduction for some datasets/models.
- For multi-step forecasting with deep models, wavelet features show modest but consistent gains over univariate models for most datasets and architectures.
- Cross-validation indicates that non-Haar wavelets often perform best, justifying selection of wavelet complexity.

In summary, the paper presents a systematic framework and empirical analysis that strongly advocates for using wavelet transforms to extract useful features from time series when building forecasting models. The results demonstrate broader applicability and superior performance compared to prior related works.
