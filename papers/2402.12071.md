# [EmoBench: Evaluating the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12071)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Research on evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is limited. 
- Existing EI benchmarks have two major shortcomings:
   1) They focus only on emotion recognition, neglecting essential EI capabilities like emotion regulation and facilitation.
   2) They use existing datasets which rely on frequent patterns and explicit information rather than reasoning and implications.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EmoBench, a comprehensive EI benchmark consisting of 400 hand-crafted questions in English and Chinese. 
- EmoBench is based on established psychological theories and defines machine EI across two dimensions:
   1) Emotional Understanding (EU): recognizing emotions and their causes
   2) Emotional Application (EA): applying the understanding to facilitate thoughts and manage emotions
- The benchmark includes emotionally sophisticated scenarios with multiple individuals and multi-label annotations across diverse social situations and relationships.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark to propose a comprehensive framework for EI evaluation including EU and EA
- Hand-crafts challenging scenarios that require reasoning and implications rather than relying on patterns
- Experiments show all LLMs find EU more challenging than EA and GPT-4 significantly outperforms other models
- GPT-4 comes close but still falls short of average human performance, highlighting gap in current LLMs' EI
- Publicly released benchmark to facilitate research on emotionally intelligent LLMs

In summary, the paper presents EmoBench, a new challenging benchmark for evaluating emotional intelligence in LLMs. Experiments show current LLMs still lag behind humans, providing promising future research directions.
