# [X-AMR Annotation Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs) are useful graph-based semantic representations that capture meaning from text. However, AMRs have limitations in linking events and entities across sentences and documents. This hinders a full understanding of narratives spanning multiple contexts.
- There is a lack of techniques to handle cross-document event coreference, where events described across documents need to be linked together for coherent understanding. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel framework called Cross-document Abstract Meaning Representation (X-AMR) to enhance AMR to overcome its limitations in cross-document entity and event coreference.

- A specialized annotation interface is developed using the Prodigy tool and a model-in-the-loop approach to collect X-AMR annotations. This focuses on easing the annotation process and creating an enhanced X-AMR dataset.

- GPT is also employed in a retrieval augmented generation methodology to further assist with cross-document argument extraction.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of the X-AMR framework to extend AMR for cross-document event semantics.

- Development of an annotation interface and methodology to collect quality X-AMR annotations leveraging machine assistance.

- Enriched X-AMR dataset generated by annotating an existing event coreference corpus.

- Analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the annotation approach and tools in improving efficiency.

- Showcasing how large language models like GPT can be utilized for complex cross-document relational tasks through prompt engineering.

In summary, the key innovation is the X-AMR framework and an annotation recipe to address limitations of AMRs in capturing cross-document event semantics.
