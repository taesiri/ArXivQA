# [Model X-ray:Detect Backdoored Models via Decision Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being increasingly deployed through cloud-based APIs in a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) paradigm. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a model functions normally on clean inputs but gets manipulated on inputs containing specific triggers. Existing backdoor detection methods have limitations in practical MLaaS settings, requiring access to training data, model internals, or soft predictions. There is a need for detection methods that rely solely on hard predictions from the model API.  

Key Idea:
The paper first makes an intriguing observation - the decision boundaries of clean and backdoored models are discernibly different. Specifically, the boundaries of a backdoored model are more "gathered", with trigger samples forming large regions dominated by the target label. Leveraging this, two detection strategies are proposed using metrics on visualized 2D decision boundaries obtained solely from hard predictions:

1) RÃ©nyi Entropy (RE) of prediction area distributions - backdoored models have lower RE
2) Area dominated by Triplet Samples (ATS) - backdoored models have lower ATS

The method can also identify the target attack label in all-to-one attacks from skewed prediction area distributions.

Main Contributions:

- Identifies a difference in decision boundaries between clean and backdoored models explainable via attack-introduced shortcuts

- Proposes a backdoor detection method called Model X-ray that relies solely on hard predictions from the model API

- Achieves state-of-the-art detection performance across diverse attacks, datasets and architectures compared to methods needing more privileged access  

- Can also identify target attack label in all-to-one attacks, a capability most methods lack

- Requires only 60 clean samples for high effectiveness and no optimization or training, making it efficient and plug-and-play

The key novelty is a detection capability rivaling methods needing greater access, relying only on hard predictions - a scenario representative of many practical MLaaS settings. By visualizing anomalies in decision boundaries, Model X-ray provides an intuitive approach to expose backdoors in black-box APIs.
