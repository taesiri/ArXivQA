# [FrameNeRF: A Simple and Efficient Framework for Few-shot Novel View   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fast high-fidelity neural radiance field (NeRF) models can generate high quality novel views, but require dense input views during training which limits their applicability for few-shot novel view synthesis with sparse inputs. 
- Regularization methods can enable few-shot novel view synthesis, but often generate artifacts and lack details compared to high-fidelity models.

Proposed Solution:
- FrameNeRF: A 3-stage training framework to leverage strengths of regularization and high-fidelity models
- Stage 1: Train regularization model (e.g. FreeNeRF) on sparse views to generate dense pseudo-views
- Stage 2: Train fast high-fidelity model (e.g. TensoRF) on dense pseudo-views from Stage 1  
- Stage 3: Fine-tune high-fidelity model on original sparse views to correct artifacts and learn more details

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a straightforward yet effective framework to apply fast high-fidelity NeRF models to few-shot tasks by generating dense views through a regularization model
- Achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis quality by combining strengths of regularization and high-fidelity models
- Provides flexibility to choose different regularization and high-fidelity models as components based on the dataset  
- Outperforms existing methods on multiple few-shot benchmark datasets like Blender, LLFF and DTU

In summary, FrameNeRF allows harnessing fast high-fidelity NeRF models for few-shot view synthesis through a simple 3-stage training approach using an off-the-shelf regularization model and fine-tuning on real data.
