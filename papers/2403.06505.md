# [Vosh: Voxel-Mesh Hybrid Representation for Real-Time View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) enable high-quality novel view synthesis, but have slow rendering speeds unsuitable for real-time applications, especially on mobile devices. 
- Voxel-based methods offer high quality but dense sampling is expensive. Mesh-based methods are fast but suffer quality issues representing complex regions.
- There is a need for a hybrid representation balancing quality and speed for real-time rendering on mobiles.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Vosh, a novel voxel-mesh hybrid representation for NeRF, combining the strengths of voxels and mesh.
- A voxel grid is first trained. Then a subset of voxels with simple geometry/textures is converted to mesh via differentiable rendering.
- Hybrid rendering is performed by integrating volumetric and surface rendering. Dynamic voxel adjustment further optimizes the balance.
- This allows quality preservation in complex areas via voxels, and acceleration in simple areas via mesh.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneering voxel-mesh hybrid scene representation for NeRF optimized for quality and speed.
- Flexible voxel adjustment to control voxel-mesh ratios catering to different devices. 
- First NeRF method to achieve real-time high-quality rendering on mobiles.
- Extensive experiments validate rendering quality and speed superior to state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the key innovation is the strategically constructed voxel-mesh hybrid representation that unlocks real-time high-quality view synthesis on resource-constrained mobile devices. The flexibility in voxel-mesh ratios provides versatility across devices and usage needs.
