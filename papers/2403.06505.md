# [Vosh: Voxel-Mesh Hybrid Representation for Real-Time View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) enable high-quality novel view synthesis, but have slow rendering speeds unsuitable for real-time applications, especially on mobile devices. 
- Voxel-based methods offer high quality but dense sampling is expensive. Mesh-based methods are fast but suffer quality issues representing complex regions.
- There is a need for a hybrid representation balancing quality and speed for real-time rendering on mobiles.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Vosh, a novel voxel-mesh hybrid representation for NeRF, combining the strengths of voxels and mesh.
- A voxel grid is first trained. Then a subset of voxels with simple geometry/textures is converted to mesh via differentiable rendering.
- Hybrid rendering is performed by integrating volumetric and surface rendering. Dynamic voxel adjustment further optimizes the balance.
- This allows quality preservation in complex areas via voxels, and acceleration in simple areas via mesh.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneering voxel-mesh hybrid scene representation for NeRF optimized for quality and speed.
- Flexible voxel adjustment to control voxel-mesh ratios catering to different devices. 
- First NeRF method to achieve real-time high-quality rendering on mobiles.
- Extensive experiments validate rendering quality and speed superior to state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the key innovation is the strategically constructed voxel-mesh hybrid representation that unlocks real-time high-quality view synthesis on resource-constrained mobile devices. The flexibility in voxel-mesh ratios provides versatility across devices and usage needs.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a new hybrid representation namely \emph{Vosh} (VOxel-meSH), by combing voxels and mesh for NeRF-based real-time view synthesis. Specifically, Vosh seamlessly combines both voxel and mesh components in hybrid rendering for view synthesis, excelling in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in intricate regions by leveraging voxel component.
