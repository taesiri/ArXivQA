# [Receding Horizon Re-ordering of Multi-Agent Execution Schedules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04190)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an optimization-based receding horizon feedback control scheme to dynamically re-order fleets of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) executing multi-agent path finding (MAPF) plans in environments with unpredictable delays, such as warehouses with human workers or other dynamic obstacles. The key innovation is the introduction of the Switchable Action Dependency Graph (SADG), which extends prior work on Action Dependency Graphs (ADGs) by modeling allowed reorderings of AGVs at roadmap intersections while maintaining collision avoidance and deadlock avoidance guarantees. Based on the SADG, the authors formulate a mixed-integer linear program to find optimal reorderings in real-time that minimize the cumulative completion time of all AGVs' routes. This approach is evaluated in simulation across a variety of roadmaps, AGV fleet sizes, and delay conditions, reducing completion times by 8-25% compared to a baseline ADG method and state of the art robust MAPF solver. The method guarantees persistent collision and deadlock avoidance for AGVs during execution and can utilize any existing MAPF solver during initial planning. Overall, it enables more efficient coordination of AGV fleets experiencing frequent delays in unpredictable environments.
