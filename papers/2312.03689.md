# [Evaluating and Mitigating Discrimination in Language Model Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03689)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method to proactively evaluate the potential for discrimination in language model decisions across a wide range of hypothetical use cases. The authors use language models to generate 70 decision scenarios covering areas like finance, government, and culture. They compose prompts emulating how users might query models to make decisions in these scenarios, systematically varying only demographic information about the subject. Applying this methodology to the Claude 2.0 model reveals both positive and negative discrimination in select settings when no interventions are used. Specifically, the model exhibits higher likelihood of positive outcomes for women, non-binary individuals, and non-white groups, while exhibiting lower likelihood for older individuals. The authors demonstrate techniques involving careful prompt engineering, like stating discrimination is illegal, that can significantly reduce both positive and negative discrimination. While not endorsing deployment in high-risk settings, the authors provide tools for developers and policymakers to anticipate and mitigate harms as language model capabilities expand. The work enables evaluation of societal impacts prior to real-world use through model-generated, human-validated evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a methodology for proactively evaluating potential discrimination in language model decisions across a wide range of hypothetical societal applications, finding patterns of positive and negative discrimination in an unnamed model, and demonstrating prompt-based techniques to mitigate such biases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method to proactively evaluate the potential for discrimination in language model decisions across a wide range of hypothetical use cases. Specifically:

1) The authors generate 70 diverse decision scenarios where language models could potentially be used to make or influence decisions about people. These scenarios span areas like business, finance, government, science, arts, and personal decisions.

2) For each scenario, they generate prompts that emulate how people might query a language model to help automate such decisions. The prompts contain placeholders for the age, race, and gender of the subject of the decision.  

3) By filling these placeholders with different demographic groups and asking language models to make decisions, they evaluate differences in decision outcomes across groups to measure discrimination, without needing to deploy models in sensitive real-world settings.

4) Applying this methodology to the Claude 2.0 model reveals patterns of both positive and negative discrimination in select hypothetical settings when no prompt interventions are applied.

5) They demonstrate techniques to significantly decrease discrimination through careful prompt engineering, providing pathways to mitigate issues before models are deployed.

In summary, the key contribution is a scalable method to anticipate and measure language model discrimination risks across a diverse set of potential applications, enabling developers and policymakers to address issues proactively.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper generates hypothetical decision scenarios using language models. What are some of the potential limitations or biases that could be introduced in the decision scenarios and questions through this generative process? How could the methodology be improved to address these issues?

2. The paper evaluates discrimination primarily through differences in probability of positive outcomes across groups. What are some alternative metrics or analyses that could provide additional insights into model behavior? For example, exploring uncertainty estimates or rationale texts.  

3. What mechanisms in the model training process might lead to the observed patterns of discrimination found in the results? How might the training methodology be adapted to directly address potential issues?

4. The paper explores the impact of various prompt-based interventions on mitigating discrimination. What are some of the potential downsides or limitations of relying solely on prompts? How could more robust architectural or training interventions complement prompt engineering?  

5. How well would the methodology explored generalize to evaluating potential discrimination in interactive settings where models engage in multi-turn dialogues? What adaptations would be necessary?

6. The paper acknowledges the complexity in choosing names associated with certain demographics in audit studies. What steps could be taken to construct a more representative and unbiased set of names for such evaluations?  

7. What would a user study look like that evaluates whether similar patterns of discrimination hold when real users query models compared to the automated evaluations conducted here? What additional insights could such a study provide?

8. The paper does not analyze intersectional impacts between multiple attributes like race and gender. How could the analysis approach be extended to uncover such intersectional effects? What results might we expect?

9. Are there alternative statistical models besides the mixed effects model used that could provide additional insights into discrimination patterns and their variability across prompts and groups?

10. How well do the patterns of discrimination found generalize to language models besides Claude? What steps could be taken to benchmark discrimination across a representative set of models?
