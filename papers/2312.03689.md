# [Evaluating and Mitigating Discrimination in Language Model Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03689)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method to proactively evaluate the potential for discrimination in language model decisions across a wide range of hypothetical use cases. The authors use language models to generate 70 decision scenarios covering areas like finance, government, and culture. They compose prompts emulating how users might query models to make decisions in these scenarios, systematically varying only demographic information about the subject. Applying this methodology to the Claude 2.0 model reveals both positive and negative discrimination in select settings when no interventions are used. Specifically, the model exhibits higher likelihood of positive outcomes for women, non-binary individuals, and non-white groups, while exhibiting lower likelihood for older individuals. The authors demonstrate techniques involving careful prompt engineering, like stating discrimination is illegal, that can significantly reduce both positive and negative discrimination. While not endorsing deployment in high-risk settings, the authors provide tools for developers and policymakers to anticipate and mitigate harms as language model capabilities expand. The work enables evaluation of societal impacts prior to real-world use through model-generated, human-validated evaluations.
