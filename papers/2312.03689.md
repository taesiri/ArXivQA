# [Evaluating and Mitigating Discrimination in Language Model Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LMs) advance, there is growing interest in using them for high-stakes societal decisions like approving loans or granting visas. However, LMs have the potential for discrimination when making such decisions about people. There is a need for better methods to evaluate these risks across a wide range of potential LM applications before real-world deployment.

Methodology: 
The authors present a method to proactively assess LM discrimination risks by:

1) Using an LM to generate 70 diverse hypothetical decision scenarios spanning areas like business, law, finance, etc. The scenarios involve questions like "Should this person be given a loan?"

2) Filling the questions with different demographic profiles by varying age, gender, and race. This enables measuring discrimination as differences in probability of a "yes" decision by group.

3) Analyzing discrimination in Claude 2.0 on the resulting questions. Without interventions, the model shows notable positive discrimination favoring women and minorities, and negative discrimination against ages over 60.

4) Demonstrating prompt engineering techniques that eliminate the majority of discrimination. For example, stating discrimination is illegal or asking the model to describe its reasoning process while avoiding biases.

Contributions:
- Method for proactively evaluating discrimination risks across many potential LM application areas before real-world deployment 

- Analysis showing presence of both positive and negative LM discrimination effects in select areas

- Demonstration of prompt strategies to mitigate discrimination 

Overall, the work provides tools for developers and policymakers to anticipate LM discrimination as applications expand, enabling issues to be addressed proactively before harm occurs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method to proactively evaluate the potential for discrimination in language model decisions across a wide range of hypothetical societal applications, and demonstrates techniques to significantly reduce both positive and negative discrimination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method to proactively evaluate the potential for discrimination in language model decisions across a wide range of hypothetical use cases. The key aspects of the method are:

1) Using a language model to generate a diverse set of 70 decision scenarios (templates) covering different areas of society where language models could be applied to make or influence decisions about people.

2) Filling these templates with different demographic groups by explicitly stating race, gender, and age or by using names associated with certain demographics. 

3) Analyzing whether the language model suggests more positive outcomes for certain groups over others when making decisions based on these filled templates.

4) Demonstrating prompt engineering techniques, such as stating that discrimination is illegal, that can significantly reduce measured discrimination.

The authors use this method to uncover and mitigate patterns of discrimination in the Claude 2.0 model. They release their dataset and prompts to enable further research into anticipating and addressing harms from language models before deployment. Overall, the work provides a scalable approach to evaluating language model impacts on society.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content of the paper, some key terms and keywords that seem most relevant are:

- Language models
- Discrimination
- Bias mitigation
- Algorithmic fairness
- Model evaluations
- Societal impacts

The paper discusses evaluating potential discrimination in language model decisions across a range of hypothetical societal applications. It generates prompts emulating how people could query language models to make decisions, systematically varies demographic attributes in the prompts, and measures differences in model decisions. The paper also explores methods to mitigate observed discrimination.

So key terms cover language models themselves, different aspects of fairness and bias like discrimination, methods for evaluations especially on societal impacts, and techniques to reduce unwanted model behaviors like prompt engineering. The terms help characterize the overall focus on assessing and addressing discrimination risks with language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper relies on generating hypothetical decision scenarios using a language model. What are some of the limitations or potential issues with using language model-generated prompts as opposed to real world data? How could the methodology be adapted to use more naturalistic data in the future?

2. When analyzing discrimination, the paper focuses on just three attributes - age, gender, and race. How could the methodology be extended to measure discrimination across a wider range of attributes like income, health status, or religion? What computational or data challenges might this introduce?

3. The paper demonstrates prompt-based interventions that greatly reduce measured discrimination. However, could these interventions reduce model usefulness? What analyses could be done to better understand this tradeoff between fairness and performance? 

4. The paper analyzes differences in the aggregate acceptance rates across groups. How could the methodology be extended to better understand intersectional impacts, for example the combined effect of being both a certain gender and race?

5. What are some ways the methodology could be adapted from analyzing language model decisions to also study impacts on human decision making in an advisory loop? What new challenges might this introduce?

6. The paper relies on a set of names chosen to be associated with certain races and genders. What are limitations of this approach? How could more representative sets of names be generated programmatically in future work?  

7. The paper finds higher measured discrimination when demographics are explicitly provided versus just names. What might explain this discrepancy? What are the implications for real world uses?

8. What types of real world data could the proposed model-generated evaluations complement? For example, how could this method assist traditional audit studies? What are the tradeoffs between both approaches?

9. The paper focuses on discrimination, but the generative methodology could likely be extended to measure model biases related to any societal concept. What other phenomena beyond discrimination should be studied in model decisions using this approach?

10. The paper demonstrates reducing discrimination through careful prompt design, but what policy or governance solutions should accompany prompt engineering to responsibly address these issues?
