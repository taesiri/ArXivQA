# [Evaluating and Mitigating Discrimination in Language Model Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LMs) advance, there is growing interest in using them for high-stakes societal decisions like approving loans or granting visas. However, LMs have the potential for discrimination when making such decisions about people. There is a need for better methods to evaluate these risks across a wide range of potential LM applications before real-world deployment.

Methodology: 
The authors present a method to proactively assess LM discrimination risks by:

1) Using an LM to generate 70 diverse hypothetical decision scenarios spanning areas like business, law, finance, etc. The scenarios involve questions like "Should this person be given a loan?"

2) Filling the questions with different demographic profiles by varying age, gender, and race. This enables measuring discrimination as differences in probability of a "yes" decision by group.

3) Analyzing discrimination in Claude 2.0 on the resulting questions. Without interventions, the model shows notable positive discrimination favoring women and minorities, and negative discrimination against ages over 60.

4) Demonstrating prompt engineering techniques that eliminate the majority of discrimination. For example, stating discrimination is illegal or asking the model to describe its reasoning process while avoiding biases.

Contributions:
- Method for proactively evaluating discrimination risks across many potential LM application areas before real-world deployment 

- Analysis showing presence of both positive and negative LM discrimination effects in select areas

- Demonstration of prompt strategies to mitigate discrimination 

Overall, the work provides tools for developers and policymakers to anticipate LM discrimination as applications expand, enabling issues to be addressed proactively before harm occurs.
