# [A Unified Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation based on Instance   Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05024)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unified framework called LIWUDA for addressing four distinct unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) settings: closed set domain adaptation (CSDA), partial domain adaptation (PDA), open set domain adaptation (OSDA), and universal domain adaptation (UniDA). The key innovation is the use of a weight network to assign instance weights denoting the probability of instances belonging to common classes across domains. This allows LIWUDA to effectively handle negative transfer caused by domain-specific private classes in the various UDA settings. Three main components are then introduced on top of the weight network: (1) Weighted Optimal Transport (WOT) to align the weighted source and target distributions while minimizing negative transfer; (2) A Separate and Align (SA) loss based on WOT cost to separate dissimilar instances and align similar instances across domains; (3) An Intra-domain Optimal Transport (IOT) loss to provide auxiliary information to guide the training of the weight network. By integrating these components, LIWUDA offers a unified solution for all four UDA settings. Experiments conducted on the Office-31, Office-Home and VisDA datasets demonstrate that LIWUDA achieves state-of-the-art performance under the UniDA, PDA and OSDA settings, verifying its effectiveness.
