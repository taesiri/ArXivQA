# [Algorithms for Caching and MTS with reduced number of predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06280)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies online algorithms for caching and metrical task systems (MTS) that utilize predictions to guide their decisions. Producing high-quality predictions can be computationally expensive. Therefore, the paper explores algorithms that use predictions more parsimoniously while still achieving strong performance guarantees. Specifically, the paper focuses on two parameters: (1) limiting the total number of predictions the algorithm can request, and (2) enforcing a minimum time separation between prediction requests.

Proposed Solution:
For caching, the paper presents an algorithm called F&R that switches between a "follower" mode and a "robust" mode. In follower mode, the algorithm requests predictions from a cache simulator at page faults and follows the predictions when they are accurate. If a prediction is detected to be inaccurate, the algorithm switches to a robust marking-style algorithm for the duration of one phase. The robust mode bounds the impact of inaccurate predictions while limiting further prediction requests. By carefully distributing the allowed prediction budget across robust phases, F&R achieves a smooth tradeoff between performance with perfect and imperfect predictions.

For MTS, the paper gives an algorithm called FtSP that requests predictions periodically and uses work functions to map the predicted states to actual algorithm states. FtSP is O(a)-competitive if predictions are provided only once every a steps. This matches the known advice complexity lower bounds.

Main Contributions:
- New prediction-efficient algorithms F&R and FtSP for caching and MTS respectively that carefully manage the prediction budget to achieve smooth robustness.
- F&R achieves O(1) consistency and O(log k) robustness while using only O(âˆšk) OPT predictions. In contrast, previous algorithms require predictions every step.
- FtSP achieves O(a) consistency and robustness with 1 prediction every a steps. This matches known lower bounds for this sparse advice setting.
- Experiments showing F&R has empirical performance matching algorithms with unrestricted prediction access.

The key ideas are gracefully handling phases with few/no predictions and precisely allocating the prediction budget to maximize impact. The paper initiates the study of prediction parsimony, an important consideration given the computational expense of state-of-the-art predictors.
