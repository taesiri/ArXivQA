# [MvKSR: Multi-view Knowledge-guided Scene Recovery for Hazy and Rainy   Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
High-quality imaging is crucial for intelligent imaging systems (IIS) used in transportation and industry for real-time monitoring, early warning and data analysis. However, adverse weather conditions like haze and rain can degrade image quality, causing blurring, low contrast and incorrect assessments by IIS. Existing methods either rely on physical models which fail in complex unpredictable conditions, or learning-based methods which lack generalizability across conditions. There is a need for efficient and robust methods that can restore images degraded by haze, rain and mixed conditions within a single framework.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Multi-View Knowledge-Guided Scene Recovery Network (MvKSR) to address this problem. The key aspects are:

1) Use guided filtering to separate degraded image into high and low frequency components containing textures and structure respectively.

2) A Multi-View Feature Coarse Extraction (MCE) module with an en-decoder network extracts features from multiple views - degraded image and high/low frequencies.  

3) A Multi-View Feature Fine Fusion (MFF) module guides image restoration through mixed supervision of grayscale and RGB domains under different views. It uses full supervision of output vs ground truth and self-supervision between views.

4) Atrous residual blocks handle both global and local restoration. 

5) Training uses multi-scale structural similarity and contrastive regularization losses.

Main Contributions:

- A novel framework MvKSR that can jointly restore hazy, rainy and mixed degraded images using a single network, through multi-view learning.

- A mixed supervision strategy with full and self-supervision between views to improve generalization.  

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance across hazy, rainy and mixed conditions compared to prior works.

- More efficient computation than prior methods, enabling suitability for IIS edge devices.

In summary, the paper proposes an end-to-end network MvKSR that leverages multi-view learning and mixed supervision to achieve robust performance across diverse degradation conditions for IIS applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-view knowledge-guided scene recovery network (MvKSR) that restores hazy, rainy, and mixed degraded images in intelligent imaging systems by separating high/low-frequency components, extracting multi-view features, and fusing them using mixed supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a novel multi-view knowledge-guided scene recovery network (MvKSR) to achieve hazy, rainy, and mixed scene recovery in intelligent imaging systems (IIS). Specifically, MvKSR can learn different imaging degradations from multiple views through multi-view coarse and fine feature extraction modules to obtain performance gains in complex degraded scene restoration. 

2. It proposes a mixed supervision strategy with full supervision and self-supervision losses calculated in the grayscale domain. This greatly improves the generalization ability of the network.

3. It demonstrates through quantitative and qualitative experiments that MvKSR has the capacity to significantly improve the visual quality of images under different weather conditions. It also shows efficient computation time compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for industrial application in IIS.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a specialized network architecture and training strategy for enhanced performance in hazy, rainy and mixed weather image restoration targeted for intelligent imaging systems. The efficiency and versatility of MvKSR are validated through extensive experiments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes guided filtering to decompose the degraded image into high and low frequency components. What is the motivation behind separating these components and processing them individually? How does this approach help improve the overall restoration performance?

2. The paper proposes a Multi-view Feature Coarse Extraction Module (MCE) using an encoder-decoder network architecture. What is the rationale behind adopting a multi-view learning approach? How does learning from different "views" of the degraded image help the model generalize better?  

3. The paper suggests using a Mixed Residual Block (MRB) with both standard and atrous convolutions. Why is atrous convolution preferred over regular convolution in later layers? How does it help retain more fine-grained spatial details?

4. The Multi-view Feature Fine Fusion Module (MFF) employs a cross-supervision strategy with both full and self-supervision losses. What specific benefits does this mixed supervision provide over regular supervision alone?

5. What is the motivation behind performing supervision in the grayscale domain rather than RGB? What perceptual advantages does grayscale space offer for degraded image restoration?  

6. The paper uses MS-SSIM and Contrastive Regularization losses. Why are these losses preferred over simpler losses like MSE or L1? What specific traits do they enforce in the restored images?

7. How does the proposed method handle the joint restoration of hazy, rainy and mixed degradation scenarios using a single model? What architectural components allow it to generalize across multiple weather conditions?

8. The high/low frequency analysis in Table 3 shows improved performance from utilizing both components. What complementary information does each component provide to facilitate better restoration?

9. Loss function analysis in Table 4 indicates better results from additional self-supervision. How exactly does self-supervision complement full supervision to improve model generalization? 

10. The paper demonstrates lower computational requirements than prior arts in Table 5. What specific architectural modifications and design choices contribute to the improved efficiency of the proposed method?
