# [Opera Graeca Adnotata: Building a 34M+ Token Multilayer Corpus for   Ancient Greek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Opera Graeca Adnotata (OGA), a new 34+ million token multilayer corpus for Ancient Greek. OGA contains 1,687 literary works ranging from 800 BCE to 250 CE. The texts are sourced from the PerseusDL and OpenGreekAndLatin GitHub repositories and converted to standoff PAULA XML/LAULA XML format to allow scalability and reusability.  

OGA contains seven annotation layers: (1) Tokenization, (2) Sentence segmentation, (3) Lemmatization, (4) Morphological analysis, (5) Dependency parsing, (6) Dependency functions, and (7) CTS citations to identify passages. Layers 1-2 were created with rule-based algorithms. Layers 3-6 were generated automatically using the COMBO parser trained on the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank.

A key contribution is the conversion of complex TEI-encoded texts to cleaner base texts that can be referenced by annotation layers. Preprocessing steps include: normalization of character encodings, separation of text vs paratext content, tokenization handling phenomena like crasis.  

The paper examines the limitations of the inline PAULA XML format for scalability, leading to the creation of the more lightweight standoff LAULA XML format. LAULA XML retains the graph model of PAULA but with shortened element names and added ability to encode comments, enabling faster parsing.

Overall, OGA represents the largest open-access multilayer corpus created so far for Ancient Greek. Its standoff architecture allows new layers to be added, supporting future expansion. The availability of morphological and syntactic analyses over such a large collection of literary works can benefit a wide range of classical scholarship.
