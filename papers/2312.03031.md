# [Is Ego Status All You Need for Open-Loop End-to-End Autonomous Driving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent end-to-end autonomous driving models rely heavily on ego vehicle status (velocity, acceleration, etc) for decision making when evaluated on the nuScenes dataset. This leads to underutilization of perception information from sensors.

- Existing metrics like L2 distance and collision rate do not comprehensively assess planning quality. Models can achieve good scores without necessarily making safe driving decisions.

- Over 73% of nuScenes data is simple straight line driving scenarios. This allows models to rely predominantly on ego status for planning.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new metric - intersection rate with road boundaries to evaluate if predicted trajectories adhere to roads.

- Design a simple baseline (BEV-Planner) that achieves competitive results without perception modules or ego status, highlighting issues.

- Conduct analyses on influence of ego status vs perceptual information using image corruptions and ego status noise.

Main Contributions:
- Show models rely excessively on ego status due to nuScenes distribution and limitations of existing metrics. Perception modules are underutilized.

- Propose new intersection rate metric to better capture planning performance. Baseline model highlights current benchmark limitations.  

- Comprehensive analyses and visualizations demonstrating the disproportionate influence of ego status on model predictions.

- Identify multiple issues with current open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving evaluations - biased datasets, incomplete metrics, model overreliance on ego status. 

- Suggest community reassess progress in light of these issues before claiming convincing conclusions on model performance.
