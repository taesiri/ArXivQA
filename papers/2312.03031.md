# [Is Ego Status All You Need for Open-Loop End-to-End Autonomous Driving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent end-to-end autonomous driving models rely heavily on ego vehicle status (velocity, acceleration, etc) for decision making when evaluated on the nuScenes dataset. This leads to underutilization of perception information from sensors.

- Existing metrics like L2 distance and collision rate do not comprehensively assess planning quality. Models can achieve good scores without necessarily making safe driving decisions.

- Over 73% of nuScenes data is simple straight line driving scenarios. This allows models to rely predominantly on ego status for planning.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new metric - intersection rate with road boundaries to evaluate if predicted trajectories adhere to roads.

- Design a simple baseline (BEV-Planner) that achieves competitive results without perception modules or ego status, highlighting issues.

- Conduct analyses on influence of ego status vs perceptual information using image corruptions and ego status noise.

Main Contributions:
- Show models rely excessively on ego status due to nuScenes distribution and limitations of existing metrics. Perception modules are underutilized.

- Propose new intersection rate metric to better capture planning performance. Baseline model highlights current benchmark limitations.  

- Comprehensive analyses and visualizations demonstrating the disproportionate influence of ego status on model predictions.

- Identify multiple issues with current open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving evaluations - biased datasets, incomplete metrics, model overreliance on ego status. 

- Suggest community reassess progress in light of these issues before claiming convincing conclusions on model performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper argues that in current open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving benchmarks, models tend to overly rely on ego vehicle status due to limitations of the datasets and metrics, creating a misleading impression about the state of research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It points out several issues with current open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving models and benchmarks, including the over-reliance on ego status, limitations of existing datasets and metrics, etc. 

2. It analyzes the roles of ego status and perceptual information in end-to-end models, showing that ego status tends to dominate decision making while perceptual information is underutilized.

3. It proposes a new metric to evaluate whether predicted trajectories adhere to the road, providing a more comprehensive assessment of planning quality. 

4. It designs a simple baseline model without perception modules that can achieve competitive results, further demonstrating the issues with prevailing approaches.

5. It suggests the community reassess relevant research directions and be cautious in pursuing state-of-the-art scores, as current benchmarks may yield misleading conclusions on model capabilities.

In summary, this paper contributes by comprehensively analyzing limitations of current open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving research, proposing improvements, and urging more rigorous methodology and benchmarks to advance progress in this area. The analyses and findings help demystify the state of the field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving: Evaluating autonomous driving models by replaying sensor data logs without a closed-loop simulator.

- Ego vehicle status: Information about the ego vehicle's own state, including velocity, acceleration, yaw angle. 

- Over-reliance on ego status: The paper argues that current open-loop benchmarks over-utilize ego status, resulting in models that depend too much on it rather than perception.

- Imbalanced datasets: The nuScenes dataset used in many benchmarks has a high portion of simple straight driving scenarios, which makes over-reliance on ego status more likely.

- Evaluation metrics: The paper argues that metrics like L2 distance and collision rate used in current benchmarks are not comprehensive enough to evaluate planning behaviors. 

- Intersection rate: A new metric proposed to measure if predicted trajectories adhere to road boundaries.

- Role of perception: Analyses in the paper suggest perception currently plays a diminished role compared to ego status in many open-loop end-to-end models.

- Misleading benchmarks: Due to the limitations above, the paper argues that current open-loop benchmarks may present an overly-optimistic view of progress in end-to-end autonomous driving.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper points out several limitations of current open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving benchmarks. What are some of the key dataset imbalances and evaluation metric issues highlighted? How could these be addressed?

2. The paper introduces a new metric - intersection rate with road boundaries. What is the motivation behind this metric and what aspect of planning behavior does it aim to capture that existing metrics fail to measure effectively?  

3. The paper proposes a simple baseline model called BEV-Planner. What is the architecture and objective behind this baseline model? What role does it play in the analyses conducted in the paper?

4. A key finding is that ego status plays a dominant role in influencing planning trajectories, even outweighing perceptual inputs. What evidence supports this conclusion in the paper? How could this issue be mitigated?

5. The paper points out that ego status is often neglected in the perception stage of existing end-to-end AD pipelines. How exactly does this occur and why does this matter when evaluating planning performance?

6. For models without ego status inputs, the paper finds that simpler baselines can outperform more complex pipelines. What explanations are provided for this counterintuitive observation?

7. The paper shows the VAD model is remarkably robust to image corruptions but highly sensitive to ego status noise. What implications does this have on the safety and reliability of such end-to-end AD systems?

8. Is excluding ego status altogether a viable solution based on the analyses provided? What are some of the challenges and open questions around evaluating planning without ego status? 

9. The paper mentions issues around trajectory post-optimization in existing methods. What specific problems are highlighted and how could these be addressed?

10. For challenging scenarios like continuous cornering, all methods are shown to fail. What limitations of the open-loop evaluation paradigm does this reveal? How could progress be made in modeling planning behavior for such complex cases?
