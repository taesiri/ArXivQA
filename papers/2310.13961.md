# [Ensemble-Instruct: Generating Instruction-Tuning Data with a   Heterogeneous Mixture of LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13961)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate high quality instruction tuning data using medium-sized language models rather than very large proprietary models? 

The key points are:

- Existing techniques like Self-Instruct use huge proprietary LMs (175B parameters) to generate instruction tuning data via in-context learning. This paper explores doing it with smaller, openly licensed LMs.

- The authors propose Ensemble-Instruct, an approach with two main ideas: (1) Simplifying the in-context learning prompts to make it easier for smaller LMs, (2) Ensembling outputs from multiple LMs to improve quality. 

- Experiments show Ensemble-Instruct outperforms Self-Instruct when using smaller LMs. Data generated with it improves both vanilla and instructed base models.

- So the central hypothesis is that with prompt simplification and output ensembling, high quality instruction data can be generated even with medium-sized LMs. The results validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a technique to generate high-quality instruction-tuning data using smaller, openly accessible language models. The key ideas are:

- Categorizing tasks into those needing an input vs only output, and using simplified prompts tailored to each type during in-context learning. This makes it easier for the LM to learn the prompts.

- Ensembling outputs from multiple language models and selecting the best output using a consensus algorithm. This helps improve the accuracy and diversity of the generated data. 

- The proposed Ensemble-Instruct technique outperforms existing methods like Self-Instruct when using smaller LMs, while still improving performance of both vanilla and instruction-tuned LMs on benchmarks.

- The results show that good quality instruction-tuning data can be generated using smaller (10B-40B parameter) openly available LMs, without needing proprietary 175B+ models like in prior work.

- The paper releases the generated dataset of 45k instruction-tuning examples along with code to reproduce the technique.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating a practical technique to generate synthetic instruction-tuning data that works well even with smaller, openly available language models. This could make instruction tuning more accessible to researchers and developers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel technique called Ensemble-Instruct for generating high-quality instruction tuning data using smaller, openly accessible language models through categorization and simplification of prompts and ensembling outputs, outperforming prior work like Self-Instruct.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in the field of synthetic instruction data generation:

- Focuses on using smaller, more accessible language models (10-40B parameters) compared to very large proprietary models used in other work like Self-Instruct, Alpaca, etc. (175B+ parameters). This allows more researchers access to the techniques.

- Introduces categorization and simplification of prompts to make learning easier for smaller models during instruction generation. Other techniques like Self-Instruct used more complex prompts even for smaller models. 

- Uses ensemble techniques over outputs from multiple models to select high-quality examples. Related work has typically used a single model for generation. Ensemble provides accuracy and diversity.

- Shows strong results on SuperNI and user-oriented benchmarks, outperforming Self-Instruct and getting close to GPT-3 performance, despite using a much smaller 7B parameter model. Demonstrates effectiveness of techniques. 

- Provides an open source implementation and dataset release to enable reproducibility. Related work often relies on proprietary models.

- Analyzes efficacy of techniques deeply through ablation studies. Shows individual impact of simplification, ensembling, etc.

In summary, the key novelty is in making instruction data generation more accessible by using smaller models, but still achieving strong performance through prompt engineering and ensembling. The techniques help address limitations around model scale and availability in related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions are:

- Exploring how to further improve the quality and diversity of the generated instruction tuning data. The paper mentions some limitations around shorter outputs being preferred and potential issues with bias/incorrect outputs. Additional techniques could be developed to address these issues.

- Experimenting with different model architectures and sizes as the base learner. The current work focuses on decoder-only and sequence-to-sequence models in the 10B-40B parameter range. Testing on other model types and sizes could provide more insights.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of downstream tasks beyond just the SuperNI and user-oriented datasets. Assessing the benefits on tasks like classification, summarization, etc. would be useful.

- Combining self-supervised instruction tuning data with human-labeled data in a semi-supervised framework. The balance and techniques for fusing both data sources could be explored.

- Developing theoretical understandings around model inductive biases for instruction following. Quantifying these biases and relating them to model architecture choices.

- Deploying the approach to train models that can then be evaluated by real users interacting with an application. Moving beyond offline metrics to human-in-the-loop evaluation.

- Comparing to other instruction tuning data generation methods like Evol-Instruct, Dromedary etc. in terms of data efficiency and model performance.

So in summary, further work on data quality, model variations, task breadth, semi-supervised learning, theoretical analysis, human evaluation, and comparison to other instruction tuning techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Ensemble-Instruct, a technique for generating high-quality synthetic instruction tuning data using medium-sized language models (40 billion parameters or less). The method builds on self-instruct but addresses limitations when using smaller models as generators. Ensemble-Instruct simplifies the instruction creation process by categorizing tasks into those needing input-output instances and those needing just output instances, and using separate tailored prompts for each. It also ensembles outputs from multiple LMs, both to increase diversity and improve accuracy through majority vote filtering. Experiments show Ensemble-Instruct outperforms self-instruct for various LMs, improves both vanilla and instructed base models significantly, and that smaller instructed LMs can surpass larger vanilla LMs for this task. The method also seems to produce more sample-efficient data than self-instruct. Key ideas are prompt simplification to ease few-shot learning and output ensembling over diverse models to boost quality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Ensemble-Instruct, a technique for generating high-quality instruction tuning data using medium-sized language models (less than 40 billion parameters). The method builds on in-context learning (ICL) and has two main components: simplifying ICL prompts to reduce the burden on the language model, and ensembling outputs from multiple language models to select high-quality examples. 

The authors evaluate Ensemble-Instruct using various base models like Falcon, UL2, and FLAN for generation, and MPT-7B and GPT-JT-6B for fine-tuning. Key results show that Ensemble-Instruct outperforms the prior Self-Instruct method, improves both vanilla and instructed base models significantly, and allows smaller instructed models to surpass larger vanilla models in utility. For instance, MPT-7B tuned on Ensemble-Instruct data beats GPT-3 despite being much smaller. Overall, the method demonstrates the feasibility of generating useful instruction data without large proprietary models like GPT-3.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents Ensemble-Instruct, a technique for generating high-quality instruction tuning data using medium-sized language models (10B-40B parameters). The key ideas are:

1) Categorizing tasks into those requiring an input and those that don't, and using separate pipelines tailored to each type. This simplifies the few-shot learning problem for the LM. 

2) Generating instructions and input-output instances using the same LM. Additional outputs for each example are then generated from other LMs. 

3) Ensembling the multiple outputs using a greedy consensus algorithm based on Rouge-L scores. This helps select the most accurate and coherent output as the final synthetic example.

Experiments show Ensemble-Instruct outperforms prior work like Self-Instruct on the SuperNI benchmark when using smaller LMs for generation. It also improves the performance of both vanilla and instruction-tuned base models significantly when used for fine-tuning. Overall, it demonstrates the feasibility of high-quality instruction data generation without large proprietary LMs.
