# [Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with   synthetic boundary cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are very sensitive to the prompt provided to them, and small changes in the prompt can significantly impact performance. This makes prompt engineering very challenging. 
- Recent work has shown that LLMs can optimize prompts themselves using meta-learning, but this requires a large, high-quality benchmark to evaluate prompts. Such benchmarks are expensive and don't exist for many real-world use cases.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new system called Intent-based Prompt Calibration (IPC) which calibrates prompts by iteratively generating synthetic challenging examples and optimizing the prompt on them. 
- The system has four main components:
   1) A dataset manager 
   2) Estimators for getting predictions/annotations
   3) An evaluator for scoring prompt performance
   4) An optimizer that handles the iterative prompt improvement process
- For generative tasks, they first optimize a prompt ranker on synthetic data and then use that ranker to optimize the generative prompt. This allows optimizing generative tasks with minimal human annotation effort.

Main Contributions:
- A new approach to optimize prompts iteratively on synthetic boundary case data generated specifically to "break" the current prompt.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on tasks like moderation and text generation using very limited real data.
- A modular system architecture that can be adapted for other use cases like prompt distillation.
- A method to extend meta-prompt based optimization to generative tasks by first optimizing a prompt ranking function.

The proposed system outperforms prior meta-learning methods for prompt optimization, especially when real-world benchmark data is limited. By constructing tailored synthetic datasets, it can effectively calibrate prompts to user intent with fewer samples.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Intent-based Prompt Calibration, a new method for automatically refining prompts for large language models by iteratively generating challenging synthetic examples and optimizing the prompt using the generated data to calibrate it to the user's intent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for automatic prompt engineering called Intent-based Prompt Calibration (IPC). The key ideas of IPC are:

1) It iteratively builds a small benchmark dataset of challenging boundary cases tailored to the user's task, as part of the optimization process. This generated dataset is used to optimize the prompt.

2) It extends prompt optimization to generative tasks by first fitting a ranking prompt and using the learned ranker to optimize the generative prompt. This allows optimizing generative tasks with minimal human annotation effort.

3) The system components like synthetic data generation and prompt optimization are implemented by prompting large language models (LLMs). The modules iteratively refine each other until the prompt converges.

4) The method is evaluated on real-world use cases like moderation and generation. It shows improved performance over prior arts when using a small number of samples.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an iterative prompt calibration process that jointly generates synthetic boundary case data and optimizes prompts tailored to the user's intent, demonstrating effectiveness on tasks like moderation and generation. The system is built in a modular and flexible way to enable easy adaptation.
