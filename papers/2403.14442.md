# [RoDLA: Benchmarking the Robustness of Document Layout Analysis Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The robustness of Document Layout Analysis (DLA) models remains underexplored, even though real-world documents often contain noise, distortions, and other perturbations that can degrade model performance. Existing benchmarks focus on clean documents and do not systematically evaluate model robustness.   

Solution:
The paper introduces the first robustness benchmark for evaluating DLA models, consisting of:

1) A taxonomy of 12 common document perturbations across 5 groups, each with 3 severity levels, covering 450K images across 3 datasets.

2) Two new metrics - Mean Perturbation Effect (mPE) to quantify image perturbations and Mean Robustness Degradation (mRD) to evaluate model robustness. 

3) A novel model called Robust Document Layout Analyzer (RoDLA) that enhances attention mechanisms to capture perturbation-insensitive features.

Key Contributions:  

- Comprehensive benchmark with real-world perturbations for testing DLA robustness 

- Taxonomy of 12 perturbation types and 36 severity levels inspired by document image challenges

- New metrics mPE and mRD to separate perturbation impacts from model robustness  

- RoDLA model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on clean data and robustness benchmarks, improving mAP by up to 12.1% on perturbed data

The benchmark and RoDLA model significantly advance research into DLA model robustness against noise and distortions, enabling more reliable document analysis in the real world.
