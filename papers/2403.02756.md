# [Role Prompting Guided Domain Adaptation with General Capability Preserve   for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to experience catastrophic forgetting of their general capabilities when specialized to specific domains.  
- Training a single LLM for multiple domains simultaneously can cause inter-domain confusion which negatively impacts performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a strategy called Role Prompt Guided Multi-Domain Adaptation (REGA) to balance domain specialization and preservation of general capabilities in LLMs.

Key Components of REGA:
1) Self-Distillation: Uses the LLM itself to generate responses to diverse general domain instructions before adaptation. These serve as exemplars during training to retain generic abilities.

2) Role Prompting: Assigns the LLM a central prompt for general domain and unique role prompts for each specialty domain. This allows clear distinction between domains.  

3) Role Integration: Reuses a fraction of domain data with central prompt to facilitate transfer of specialty knowledge into central role. Allows streamlined inference without prompt switching.

Main Contributions:  
- Demonstrates REGA enhances domain performance of LLMs while alleviating catastrophic forgetting and confusion.
- Provides strong empirical evidence for effectiveness of each REGA component.  
- Shows central prompt successfully acquires and integrates abilities from specialty prompts.
- Establishes REGA allows models to smoothly process diverse instructions without prompt selection burden.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions regarding effectively adapting LLMs for multiple domains while retaining critical general skills through a well-designed training strategy.
