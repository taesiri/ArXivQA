# [Match-Stereo-Videos: Bidirectional Alignment for Consistent Dynamic   Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10755)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of dynamic stereo matching - estimating consistent disparity maps from stereo video sequences, especially for dynamic scenes with moving objects. Most existing learning-based methods apply per-frame matching and window-based cost aggregation across time, which leads to temporal inconsistencies and flickering disparities. The key challenges are effectively utilizing cross-frame information and propagating consistency globally across the sequence.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes BiDAStereo, a novel framework for consistent dynamic stereo matching based on bidirectional alignment. The key ideas are:

1) Develop a bidirectional alignment mechanism between adjacent frames as a fundamental operation for enforcing temporal consistency. This is applied in two modules:

- Triple-Frame Correlation Layer: Align features of adjacent frames and construct cost volumes to expand local temporal receptive field.

- Motion-Propagation Recurrent Unit: Align hidden motion state features between adjacent frames and recurrently update them to propagate global consistency information.

2) Adopt a paradigm of local matching and global aggregation, in contrast to existing per-frame matching and window-based aggregation schemes.

Main Contributions:

- Propose bidirectional alignment as an effective technique for dynamic stereo matching to improve temporal consistency.

- Develop a Triple-Frame Correlation layer to leverage local temporal information via adjacent frame alignment and cost volume construction.

- Design a novel Motion-Propagation Recurrent Unit to recursively propagate global consistency by aligning and fusing motion features across the whole sequence. 

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple dynamic stereo benchmarks in terms of accuracy and temporal consistency.

The experiments demonstrate that bidirectional alignment and the proposed local-global information utilization paradigm are effective for dynamic stereo matching.
