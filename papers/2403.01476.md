# [CCC: Color Classified Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic colorization of grayscale images with objects of varying colors/sizes is challenging due to inter- and intra-object color variations and small area of key objects compared to backgrounds. 
- Learning process favors dominant features, causing biased models. Similar to class imbalance, using a weighted function to give higher priority to minority features can help.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate colorization as a multinomial classification by proposing formulas to transform continuous color values into discrete color classes and vice versa. 
- Optimize class levels and balance feature distribution in a data-driven manner through analysis of real images. Propose 215 color classes for task.
- During training, propose class-weighted function based on true class appearance in each batch to ensure proper color saturation of individual objects. Establish trade-off between major and minor classes.
- Propose SAM-empowered object-selective color harmonization to refine edges.

Main Contributions:
1) Formulas to transform between continuous color values and discrete color classes  
2) Optimization of colorization class levels based on analysis of real images
3) Class re-weighting formula to balance contributions of all classes
4) SAM-based edge refinement 
5) New evaluation metric, Chromatic Number Ratio, to quantify color richness
6) Results showing proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on multiple datasets for visualization, CNR measurement, while maintaining performance on other criteria

In summary, the paper formulates colorization as a classification task, handles feature imbalance through optimized classes and re-weighting, refines edges, and proposes a new metric to evaluate color diversity. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
