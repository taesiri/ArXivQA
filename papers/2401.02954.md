# [DeepSeek LLM: Scaling Open-Source Language Models with Longtermism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02954)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Rapid development of closed-source large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has raised expectations for capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, prior work on scaling laws for open-source LLMs shows varying conclusions, creating uncertainties around efficiently scaling these models.

Proposed Solution 
- Authors conduct comprehensive studies on scaling laws relating model performance, compute budget, model scale and data scale. New model scale representation using non-embedding FLOPs better captures compute requirements.
- Discover that higher data quality allows more compute budget allocation to model scale rather than data scale. Fit equations for optimal hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate.
- Use findings to develop DeepSeek LLMs - open-source LLMs trained from scratch on 2 trillion multilingual tokens. Release 7B and 67B parameter base models and corresponding chat models via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Main Contributions
- Establish clear scaling laws and model/data allocation strategies for efficiently developing larger open-source LLMs. New model scale representation using FLOPs.
- Show quality of data significantly impacts optimal scaling. Higher quality data allows more model scaling.
- Release full details and evaluation results of DeepSeek LLMs. 7B and 67B base models competitive or superior to prior best open-source LLMs. 67B chat model beats GPT-3.5 in evaluations.

In summary, the paper delivers scaling laws to guide development of ever-larger open-source LLMs, introduces DeepSeek LLMs as new SOTA models, and shares details to advance community progress. The results validate efficiency of proposed scaling strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces DeepSeek LLM, a series of open-source language models trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens, studies scaling laws to guide model development, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks as well as superior conversational ability over GPT-3.5 in open-ended evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1. The authors delved into the study of scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) and presented findings to facilitate scaling LLMs to large scales (e.g. 7B and 67B parameters) for two prevalent open-source configurations. Specifically:

- They studied the scaling laws for batch size, learning rate, data scale, and model scale, and derived formulas to determine near-optimal hyperparameters and predict model performance. 

- They found the choice of pre-training data significantly impacts the optimal allocation between data scale and model scale. Higher quality data allows more compute budget to be allocated to model scale.

2. Guided by the scaling laws, the authors built the DeepSeek LLM models from scratch, currently consisting of 7B and 67B parameter models. They collected a 2 trillion token multilingual dataset for pre-training.

3. The authors fine-tuned the DeepSeek LLM models into DeepSeek Chat models using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive evaluations showed the 67B chat model surpasses models like GPT-3.5 in open-ended chat evaluations.

In summary, the key contributions are around studying scaling laws to guide the training of large open-source LLMs from scratch, along with releasing the models and evaluation results to serve as a reference.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper introduces a new model scale representation called "non-embedding FLOPs/token" (M). How is this representation more accurate than using non-embedding parameters (N1) or complete parameters (N2) to represent model scale? What are the key differences between M, N1, and N2?

2. The paper discovers that the optimal model/data scaling allocation strategy varies significantly across datasets of differing quality. What explanations are provided for why higher quality data tends to favor allocating more compute budget to model scaling versus data scaling?

3. The multi-step learning rate scheduler is chosen over the typical cosine annealing schedule. What motivations and tradeoffs factored into this design choice? In what ways can the multi-step schedule benefit continual training of larger models in the future?

4. During the staged fine-tuning process, why does excluding certain data (e.g. math, code) in the second stage reduce repetition rates and maintain benchmark performance? Does this indicate potential issues with the model's understanding of certain concepts?

5. The inclusion of instruction data during pre-training is analyzed. How does this compare to incorporating the same data during fine-tuning? What factors determine whether instruction data should be included in pre-training versus fine-tuning stages?

6. Why does adding a system prompt during inference degrade performance for the 7B model but improve performance for the 67B model? What does this suggest about the model's comprehension of the prompt's intent and meaning?

7. The paper observes that held-out testing reveals greater performance gaps between large versus small models, even when benchmark scores are comparable. What explanations are provided? How do the held-out results characterize model intelligence?

8. How reasonable are the scaling laws for optimal batch size and learning rate fitted in this work? Over what range of compute budgets were experiments conducted? What limitations exist in the current formulation?

9. The safety evaluation methodology utilizes a diverse, expert-curated testset spanning various formats. In what ways could this approach be expanded upon to more rigorously ensure model safety? What additional techniques could complement this evaluation?

10. How do the differences observed between model performance on benchmark tasks versus open-ended evaluations characterize the impacts of supervised fine-tuning? What risks does optimization on certain benchmarks pose?
