# [From Understanding to Utilization: A Survey on Explainability for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the emerging research area of explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs). As LLMs continue to advance in scale and performance across various natural language processing tasks, their complexity makes them increasingly opaque or behaved as "black boxes". This lack of transparency raises valid concerns regarding ethics, fairness and trust in deployment. 

The authors categorize existing explanation methods into two main approaches: local analysis and global analysis. Local analysis focuses on explaining individual model predictions by attributing relevance to input features or analyzing operations within transformer blocks. This includes perturbation-based methods, gradient-based feature attribution, as well as analyzing attention heads and feedforward layers. Global analysis aims to elucidate the linguistic knowledge encapsulated within LLMs using probing classifiers or by reverse engineering model representations and parameters. 

The paper also discusses applications leveraging insights from explainability to enhance LLMs. This includes efficient handling of long text, improving in-context learning, reducing hallucinations, and mitigating social biases. Finally, the authors highlight the need for tailored evaluation methods and datasets to properly assess explanation quality and downstream performance improvements attributed to explainability.

Overall, this paper provides a structured categorization of the emerging field of LLM explainability and its applications. It highlights open challenges around developing explainability methods suitable for large models and using explanations to make LLMs more transparent, fair and trustworthy. The authors bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical usage of explainability in LLMs through this comprehensive literature review.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes local analysis methods into feature attribution and analyzing individual Transformer components. How do these two categories of methods provide complementary insights into model behaviors? What are some limitations of only using one approach?

2. For perturbation-based attribution methods like LIME and SHAP, what assumptions do they make about input features that limit their applicability to large language models? How do gradient-based and vector-based attribution methods address some of these limitations?

3. When analyzing the MHSA and MLP sublayers of Transformers, what specific metrics or analyses have been commonly used to elucidate the roles of attention weights versus feedforward layers? What opportunities exist for better understanding the interactions between these components?

4. The paper discusses three main approaches under the umbrella of mechanistic interpretability - circuit discovery, causal tracing, and vocabulary lens. How does each approach offer a distinct perspective into demystifying the inner workings of language models? What are some challenges unique to each method?

5. Probing classifiers are often used to analyze the linguistic knowledge encapsulated within language model representations. What are some pros and cons of linear probes versus more complex nonlinear probes? When might simpler probes still provide valuable insights?

6. For the application of improving in-context learning, the paper highlights phenomena like overthinking, false induction heads, task vectors, and function vectors as explainability-driven discoveries. How do these concepts relate to each other and collectively improve few-shot performance? What gaps exist in fully unraveling the mechanisms of in-context learning?

7. When using explainability to edit language models, what are some key differences between memory-based editors versus locate-then-edit approaches? What challenges exist in scaling these editing techniques to larger models while preserving overall performance?

8. For evaluating explanation plausibility, the paper suggests metrics based on removing tokens and measuring downstream editing performance. What other evaluation approaches could complement these metrics to provide a more holistic assessment? What calibrated datasets are needed?

9. When evaluating truthfulness, using fine-tuned judge models can be an inexpensive alternative to human evaluation. What are some potential pitfalls when relying entirely on judge model scores? How can human judgment still play an important role?

10. Overall, what do you see as the most significant open challenges in developing explainability methods that can scale to the cutting edge of language model design advances while also proving useful for practical applications?
