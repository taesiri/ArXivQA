# [LLM+P: Empowering Large Language Models with Optimal Planning   Proficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11477)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and classical planners to solve long-horizon robot planning problems posed in natural language?

The key hypothesis is that by using LLMs to translate natural language planning prompts into a structured planning domain definition language (PDDL) format, and then leveraging efficient classical planners to find solutions, the resulting system (called LLM+P) will be able to reliably solve more complex planning problems compared to using LLMs alone.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates LLM+P, a novel framework to empower LLMs with optimal planning capabilities by connecting them with classical planners. The central hypothesis is that this approach will outperform LLMs on long-horizon planning tasks described in natural language.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of LLM+P, a framework that incorporates classical planners into large language models (LLMs) in order to enable LLMs to solve planning problems correctly and optimally. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- LLM+P takes a natural language description of a planning problem as input, and outputs a correct or optimal plan for solving that problem, also in natural language. 

- It does this by first converting the natural language description into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) file, which is then solved by a classical planner to generate a plan. 

- The LLM is used to translate between the natural language and PDDL representations.

- LLM+P is evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark planning problems taken from robotics scenarios. It is able to find optimal solutions for most problems, while LLMs alone fail to find even feasible solutions.

- LLM+P enables a home robot to efficiently solve a complex real-world manipulation task specified in natural language by a user.

In summary, the key contribution is using LLMs and classical planners together to effectively solve planning problems posed in natural language, taking advantage of the language capabilities of LLMs and the planning capabilities of classical planners. This improves on using LLMs alone, which struggle with long-horizon reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework called LLM+P that combines large language models with classical planners, enabling the language model to produce correct and optimal plans for solving planning problems specified in natural language.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on integrating large language models with planning:

- Scope: This paper focuses specifically on integrating LLMs with classical planners to enhance their long-horizon reasoning and planning capabilities. Much other related work looks at more general ways to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities, not focused on planning in particular.

- Approach: The proposed LLM+P method uses the LLM mainly for translating natural language to PDDL, without modifying the LLM architecture. Other papers have explored approaches like prompting, fine-tuning, or iteratively querying the LLM. This translational approach is quite novel.

- Evaluation: The authors do a rigorous evaluation on a diverse benchmark of planning domains from past competitions. This is more comprehensive than evaluations in some related works, which tend to use more limited proof-of-concept examples.

- Assumptions: The authors clearly state their assumptions, like having the domain PDDL provided. Other papers are sometimes less explicit about their setup.

- Integration: Rather than training the LLM to plan, this keeps the classical planner separate. This modular approach allows taking advantage of the strengths of both technologies.

- Optimality: A key contribution is enabling optimal planning, whereas most LLMs struggle with any long-horizon planning. This focus on guaranteeing correctness is important.

- Limitations: The authors honestly discuss limitations like not handling when to invoke LLM+P. Related concurrent works have similar limitations.

Overall, this paper carves out a novel approach in this emerging research area of empowering LLMs with reasoning skills. The integration with classical planning in particular, with rigorous benchmarking, helps advance the state-of-the-art. The modular design and emphasis on optimality also differentiates this work from much related literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Enabling the LLM to auto-detect when and how to apply LLM+P. The paper notes that currently they do not ask the LLM to recognize when a prompt is suitable for processing with the LLM+P pipeline. A valuable direction is to explore how the LLM could learn to automatically determine when to trigger LLM+P.

- Reducing LLM+P's dependency on human-provided information, potentially involving finetuning. The proposed LLM+P method relies on humans providing the domain PDDL, example problem, etc. The authors suggest exploring ways to reduce this dependency, such as through finetuning techniques.

- Applying the LLM+P methodology to other problem classes beyond planning. The paper notes this approach could work for any problem with a sound/complete solver, like arithmetic problems using calculators. Extending LLM+P to additional areas is suggested.

- Exploring alternate ways to integrate external solvers beyond the specific LLM+P framework. While LLM+P uses a pipeline of LLM to PDDL to planner and back, other integration approaches could be studied.

- Improving the planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs directly through methods like prompt engineering. Rather than rely on external solvers, advances could focus on enhancing LLMs' own capabilities.

- Studying how to enable LLMs to recognize when integration with an external module is needed. Making the LLM aware of when to trigger the pipeline could make the system more autonomous.

So in summary, some key directions mentioned are improving the autonomy of LLM+P, reducing dependence on human input, applying the methodology to new problem classes, alternate integration techniques, and directly improving LLMs' reasoning skills.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces LLM+P, a framework that incorporates classical planners into large language models (LLMs) in order to empower the LLMs with the ability to solve planning problems optimally. LLM+P takes a natural language description of a planning problem as input, converts it to a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) file using the LLM, solves the problem optimally using a classical planner, and converts the planner's solution back to natural language using the LLM. The authors evaluate LLM+P on a diverse benchmark of robot planning problems and find it is able to produce optimal solutions for most problems, while LLMs alone fail to produce even feasible plans. They also show LLM+P enables a home robot to efficiently solve a complex manipulation task specified in natural language by the user. Overall, the paper demonstrates that combining classical planners with LLMs can overcome the lack of long-horizon reasoning ability in LLMs while leveraging their strengths in natural language processing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper introduces LLM+P, a framework that incorporates classical planners into large language models (LLMs) in order to enable LLMs to solve planning problems correctly. LLM+P takes a natural language description of a planning problem and converts it to a PDDL file, leverages a classical planner to find a solution, then translates the solution back to natural language. The authors define benchmark robot planning problems and show through experiments that LLM+P can provide optimal solutions to most problems, while LLMs fail on their own. LLM+P enables a home robot to efficiently solve a complex manipulation task specified in natural language.

Paragraph 2: The key to LLM+P is focusing the LLM on translating the natural language prompt to a PDDL file. Providing the LLM an example problem-PDDL pair greatly helps through in-context learning. Without this context, LLM+P fails. Classical planners provide guaranteed logical correctness and optimality that LLMs lack in long-horizon reasoning. While demonstrated on planning, LLM+P could connect LLMs to any problem with a sound, complete solver. Limitations include the LLM not recognizing when to trigger LLM+P. Future work includes auto-detecting when to use LLM+P and reducing dependence on human-provided information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a framework called LLM+P that incorporates classical planners into large language models (LLMs) in order to enable LLMs to solve planning problems correctly. The key idea is that the LLM is used to convert a natural language description of a planning problem into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) file, which is then solved using a classical planner. The LLM is also used again at the end to translate the planner's solution back into natural language. Specifically, the LLM is prompted with an example problem and solution pair to provide context. Then, given a new problem description, the LLM leverages this context to generate the corresponding PDDL problem file. This PDDL file, together with a domain PDDL file provided by a domain expert, is input to the classical planner to find an optimal solution plan. Finally, the raw PDDL plan is translated back to natural language using the LLM. In this way, the strengths of the LLM and classical planner are combined - the LLM provides a natural language interface while the planner guarantees optimal solutions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the challenge of enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve planning problems correctly. Specifically, LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT have shown impressive ability to generate fluent text, but struggle with long-horizon reasoning and planning tasks. 

On the other hand, classical planners can efficiently find optimal plans if given a formal problem description, but require the problem to be encoded in a structured format like PDDL. 

The key insight of the paper is that LLMs are good at natural language tasks like translation, so they can be used to translate a natural language planning problem description into the required PDDL format. The PDDL can then be solved using an classical planner, with the LLM also translating the plan back into natural language.

In summary, the paper introduces a framework called LLM+P that combines the strengths of LLMs and classical planners to allow LLMs to solve planning problems correctly. The framework does not require fine-tuning the LLMs, just providing an example problem as context. Experiments show LLM+P can solve more planning problems correctly compared to LLMs alone.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes connecting large language models (LLMs) with classical planners to enable correct and optimal planning. However, the methodology seems to rely heavily on the classical planners for generating the actual plans. Why not focus research efforts on improving the planning capabilities of LLMs directly rather than relying on external modules? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

2. The LLM is used for translating natural language to PDDL and back to natural language. However, producing the valid PDDL itself appears to be a challenging task. How robust is the LLM at generating correct PDDL across a wide variety of planning domains? What techniques could be used to improve the LLM's PDDL generation capabilities?

3. The paper assumes the planning domain and a simple example problem/solution pair are provided upfront. In practice, how feasible is it to obtain this information, especially the domain PDDL? Could the methodology be extended to learn the domain and generate the PDDL in an unsupervised manner from numerous problem examples?

4. The methodology relies on the LLM choosing to invoke the \lmp{} pipeline based on detecting that a prompt requires planning. How well does this work in practice? Could the model be improved to better recognize when to trigger the planning module?

5. Evaluation is performed on 7 planning domains with 20 tasks each. How likely is this methodology to scale up to more complex real-world planning problems? What challenges might arise in more open-ended domains?

6. The robot tidying demonstration showcases the approach on a real robotic system. However, it is still a fairly simple scenario. How difficult would it be to apply this technique to complex robotic platforms working in unstructured environments?

7. The approach does not alter the underlying LLM, even through finetuning. How might incorporating planning-specific finetuning impact the performance? Could an end-to-end differentiable version allow joint training of the LLM and planner?

8. The methodology could likely be applied to other reasoning tasks beside planning. What other domains might benefit from connecting LLMs with formal solvers in this manner? What challenges arise in extending this beyond planning?

9. The paper focuses on optimal planning. However, humans often satisfice and use heuristics rather than optimal planning. Could this approach be modified to allow efficient satisficing in some domains rather than optimal planning?

10. What ethical considerations arise from using this methodology? Does relying on LLMs for the natural language interfacing while leveraging classical planners internally raise any risks or challenges compared to pure LLM or classical planning approaches?
