# [MM-Soc: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Social Media   Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social media platforms contain multimodal information (text, images, videos) that is challenging for machines to comprehend, especially complex tasks like understanding human emotions, memes, and detecting misinformation. 
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution but still struggle with accurately interpreting such complex social media content.
- There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multimodal social media tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MM-Soc, a novel benchmark with 10 carefully designed tasks using prominent datasets plus a new large-scale YouTube tagging dataset. 
- The tasks cover diverse domains including misinformation detection, hate speech detection, sentiment analysis, humor detection, image description etc. aimed at thoroughly assessing MLLMs.
- The paper conducts comprehensive evaluation of 10 size variants from 4 major open-source MLLMs: LLaVA, BLIP2, InstructBLIP and LLaMA.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of MM-Soc, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on understanding multimodal social media content.
- Extensive benchmarking of 10 leading open-source MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in handling social tasks.  
- LLaVA is identified as the current best open-source MLLM, but still falls short of specialized fine-tuned models.
- Analysis showing instruction following improves with model size, but MLLMs struggle to self-improve iteratively. 
- Demonstration that fine-tuning with explanations significantly boosts MLLM performance across multiple tasks.

In summary, the paper presents MM-Soc to highlight limitations of current MLLMs on social reasoning tasks to guide future research towards more capable and reliable models for social media platforms.
