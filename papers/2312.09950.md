# [Peer Learning: Learning Complex Policies in Groups from Scratch via   Action Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Peer Learning: Learning Complex Policies in Groups from Scratch via Action Recommendations":

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically learn in isolation through trial-and-error. This is different from how humans learn, where we often learn complex skills in groups through instruction, demonstration and collaboration. The paper explores the concept of "peer learning", where a group of RL agents learn a task together by exchanging action recommendations, with the goal of understanding if and how peer learning can improve performance over single agent learning.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a novel "peer learning" framework that allows a group of RL agents ("peers") to train together on the same task. Peers operate independently in separate instances of the same environment. They can communicate by asking other peers for action recommendations based on their current state, and decide whether to follow the advice using learned trust mechanisms. Trust is modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem to highlight the need for evaluating peers. Three trust mechanisms are proposed - Critic, Trust Values and Agent Values. Experiments use SAC and DQN agents on MuJoCo and gridworld tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the novel concept of "peer learning", where RL agents learn complex policies together in groups via action recommendations
- Peer learning works for discrete and continuous action spaces with different RL algorithms 
- Implements trust mechanisms based on multi-armed bandits to model motivation and identify reliable/adversarial peers
- Shows improved performance over single agent learning in MuJoCo control tasks and navigation domains
- Learns complex policies directly from peer recommendations, not just simple imitation
- Trust mechanisms prevent poisoning attacks from adversarial peers
- Performance scales with number of peers, unlike prior collaborative learning work

The paper introduces a way for RL agents to learn together in groups much like humans, with results showing both improved performance and robustness to unreliable peers. This opens interesting research directions in social learning for AI.
