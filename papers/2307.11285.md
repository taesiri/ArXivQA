# [MAS: Towards Resource-Efficient Federated Multiple-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11285)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to effectively coordinate and train multiple simultaneous federated learning (FL) tasks under resource constraints?The key points are:- The paper proposes the first FL system, called MAS (Merge and Split), to address the challenge of training multiple concurrent FL tasks efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. - Existing methods either train FL tasks sequentially, overlooking synergies among tasks, or simply combine all tasks into one model, overlooking differences among tasks. - MAS aims to optimize training of multiple FL tasks by considering both their synergies and differences.- It first merges tasks into one model, then splits tasks into groups based on measured affinities, and finally trains each task group with initialization from the merged model.- Experiments show MAS achieves superior performance over baselines with significantly less training time and energy.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by merging and splitting FL tasks in a principled way during training, MAS can optimize performance of concurrent FL tasks under resource constraints. The paper presents empirical validation of this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes MAS (Merge and Split), the first federated learning system to effectively coordinate and train multiple simultaneous federated learning (FL) tasks under resource constraints. 2. It introduces task merging and task splitting in MAS to consider both the synergies and differences among multiple FL tasks. Specifically, it first merges the multiple FL tasks into an all-in-one FL task. After training the all-in-one task for a number of rounds, it splits the tasks into groups based on their affinities measured during training. 3. It conducts extensive empirical studies on three different sets of computer vision FL tasks. The results demonstrate that MAS can elevate performance while significantly reducing training time and energy consumption compared to other methods. For example, it achieves over 40% energy consumption reduction while obtaining superior performance.4. The paper formalizes the problem of training multiple simultaneous FL tasks, which is rarely explored in prior federated learning research. It establishes baselines and benchmarks for further research in this direction.In summary, the key innovation is the proposed MAS system that leverages both task merging and splitting to effectively coordinate multiple simultaneous FL tasks. The empirical results validate that it navigates an optimized trade-off between performance and resource consumption.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes MAS, a federated learning system that combines multiple simultaneous federated learning tasks into a single multi-task model to utilize synergies, measures task affinities to split tasks into groups, and continues training task groups to optimize overall performance and resource usage.
