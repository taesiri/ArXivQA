# [Shortcut Partitions in Minor-Free Graphs: Steiner Point Removal,   Distance Oracles, Tree Covers, and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0555)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can shortcut partitions be constructed for minor-free graphs, beyond just planar graphs? 

The notion of shortcut partitions was recently introduced by Chang et al. (2022). They showed how to construct shortcut partitions for planar graphs and gave several applications, including improved tree covers. However, their construction relied heavily on planarity.

This paper shows how to construct shortcut partitions for the more general class of minor-free graphs, thereby overcoming the "planarity barrier." The main result is:

Theorem 1.1: Any edge-weighted Kr-minor-free graph admits an (ε,2O(r log r)/ε)-shortcut partition for any ε∈(0,1).

This resolves the open question of whether shortcut partitions can be constructed for minor-free graphs. The techniques involve a novel deterministic variant of the cop decomposition for minor-free graphs. 

The shortcut partition construction then enables several applications for minor-free graphs, including:

- Optimal distance oracles (resolving an open problem)
- Improved tree covers
- Resolving the Steiner Point Removal problem for minor-free graphs

So in summary, the central research question is whether shortcut partitions can be constructed beyond planar graphs, and this paper provides an affirmative answer by devising a construction for general minor-free graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is constructing a shortcut partition for minor-free graphs, in particular $K_r$-minor-free graphs. The notion of shortcut partition was recently introduced by Chang et al. (2022). Roughly speaking, a shortcut partition is a clustering of the vertices where between any pair of vertices u and v, there exists a low-hop path in the cluster graph. 

The key highlights are:

- The authors construct an (ε, 2^{O(r log r)}/ε)-shortcut partition for any edge-weighted $K_r$-minor-free graph. This resolves an open question of extending the shortcut partition framework beyond planar graphs. 

- The construction breaks away from previous planarity-exploiting techniques for planar graphs. Instead, it is based on a novel deterministic buffered cop-decomposition for minor-free graphs.

- Using the new shortcut partition, the authors resolve the Steiner Point Removal problem for minor-free graphs, by providing a general reduction from shortcut partitions to SPR.

- The shortcut partition yields several other applications including: the first optimal distance oracle for minor-free graphs, improved tree covers, and additive embeddings for apex-minor-free graphs.

Overall, this paper makes significant progress on constructing and applying shortcut partitions to minor-free graphs. The buffered cop-decomposition technique is an important contribution for tackling these non-planar graphs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of a shortcut partition, which is a graph partitioning technique that guarantees low-hop paths in the cluster graph, and uses it to construct tree covers, distance oracles, and embeddings for minor-free graphs.

In more detail, the paper makes the following contributions:

- Defines the notion of shortcut partition, which is a partitioning of a graph into low-diameter clusters that also guarantees short hop paths in the cluster graph between clusters intersecting any shortest path. 

- Constructs an optimal shortcut partition for minor-free graphs, with hop length 2^{O(r log r)}/ε for K_r-minor-free graphs.

- Shows this implies the first optimal distance oracle for minor-free graphs with O(1) stretch, space, and query time. 

- Resolves the open Steiner Point Removal problem by reducing it to finding shortcut partitions.

- Obtains the first constant-sized tree covers for minor-free graphs, improving prior size O(log^2 n).

- Gives the first deterministic constant distortion embeddings into bounded treewidth graphs for apex-minor-free graphs.

So in summary, the key innovation is the shortcut partition technique for minor-free graphs, which allows extending many planar graph algorithms to the broader minor-free graph family.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on shortcut partitions in minor-free graphs compares to other related research:

- It provides the first construction of shortcut partitions for the broad class of $K_r$-minor-free graphs. Prior work by Chang et al. only gave a construction for planar graphs, exploiting planarity in multiple steps of the construction. This paper takes a completely different approach based on buffered cop decompositions that works for minor-free graphs.

- The shortcut partition construction allows the authors to resolve the longstanding open problem of whether every $K_r$-minor-free graph admits a constant distortion distance-preserving minor when removing Steiner points. This positively resolves a question that had only been answered for a few restricted graph classes before.

- The paper obtains several other applications of shortcut partitions to minor-free graphs, including the first optimal distance oracle, first tree cover of constant size, and first deterministic additive embeddings into bounded treewidth graphs. These significantly improve prior bounds that depended on the Robertson-Seymour structure theorem.

- The hop length of the shortcut partition constructed is optimal up to constant factors. Prior work gave larger hop lengths even for planar graphs.

- The reduction from shortcut partitions to the Steiner Point Removal problem is novel. It adapts prior work on scattering partitions using a relaxed notion of approximate scattering partitions. This allows shortcut partitions to imply Steiner Point Removal despite providing weaker guarantees.

Overall, this paper makes significant progress on longstanding open problems by developing a new approach to constructing shortcut partitions in minor-free graphs. It resolves the Steiner Point Removal problem in full generality and obtains optimal distance oracles and other applications by circumventing inherent limitations of prior techniques. The results are a definitive advance for partitioning and optimization problems in minor-free graphs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest a few potential directions for future research:

1. Generalizing the shortcut partition framework to other graph families beyond planar graphs. The authors specifically mention minor-free graphs as an interesting next step. Constructing shortcut partitions for broader classes of graphs could allow their techniques to be applied more widely. 

2. Improving the parameters of the shortcut partition construction. For planar graphs, they achieve hop length $O(1/\epsilon^2)$, so reducing this dependency or getting tighter bounds would be useful.

3. Exploring additional applications of shortcut partitions. The paper focuses on a few specific applications like tree covers and distance oracles. The authors suggest investigating what other algorithmic problems could benefit from shortcut partitions.

4. Deriving lower bounds on the hop length of shortcut partitions. The paper only provides constructions achieving certain hop lengths, but does not rule out the possibility of improved constructions. Proving lower bounds on the hop length required would help characterize the optimality of shortcut partitions.

5. Developing distributed and dynamic algorithms for constructing/maintaining shortcut partitions. The paper focuses on centralized static constructions. Designing efficient distributed or dynamic algorithms for shortcut partitions could make them more practical in real-world settings.

In summary, the main suggestions are to generalize shortcut partitions to broader classes of graphs, optimize the parameters, find more applications, prove lower bounds, and develop distributed/dynamic algorithms. The shortcut partition is presented as a new framework with many potential research directions to explore.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of a shortcut partition, which is a new type of graph partitioning into clusters with small diameter. A shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices u and v, there exists a path between u and v that intersects only a small number of clusters. The authors construct a shortcut partition for planar graphs and demonstrate several applications, including building a tree cover with stretch 1+ε using a small number of trees. A key contribution is a construction of shortcut partitions for planar graphs with hop length O(1/ε^2). The authors exploit properties of planar graphs to recursively partition the graph into columns and build a grid-tree hierarchy, which is then used to construct the shortcut partition. The shortcut partition for planar graphs enables new results for planar graphs such as compact distance oracles, emulators, and routing schemes. However, the reliance on planarity appears to preclude extending the approach to general minor-free graphs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of a shortcut partition, a new type of graph partitioning scheme. The shortcut partition provides a guarantee that for any two vertices u and v in the graph G, there exists a path between u and v in the cluster graph that intersects only a small number of clusters. This is a useful primitive with applications in areas like metric embeddings, distributed computing, and network design. 

The authors construct a shortcut partition for minor-free graphs, specifically showing that any K_r-minor-free graph admits an (ε,2^{O(r log r)}/ε) shortcut partition. Using this result, they are able to resolve an open problem on the Steiner Point Removal problem, showing that any K_r-minor-free graph admits a constant distortion distance preserving minor when Steiner points are removed. Additional applications of the shortcut partition for minor-free graphs include improved distance oracles, tree covers, and embeddings into bounded treewidth graphs. Overall, the shortcut partition framework breaches the "planarity barrier" and enables extending algorithmic techniques from planar graphs to the broader class of minor-free graphs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of a shortcut partition, which is a graph partitioning scheme that guarantees for every two vertices u and v, there exists a low-hop path in the cluster graph between the clusters containing u and v. The authors construct a shortcut partition for planar graphs by first finding a set of subgraphs called columns that contain vertices near the outerface. They then recursively construct a structure called a grid-tree hierarchy on the remaining vertices, which induces the shortcut partition. The construction exploits planarity at multiple steps, using the fact that columns split the graph into subgraphs based on Jordan curve theorem. To construct a shortcut partition for minor-free graphs, the authors take a different approach based on a modified cop decomposition. They add a layer of recursion to enforce a buffer property between clusters, allowing them to bypass complex potential function analysis required in prior cop decomposition algorithms. This results in a deterministic construction of shortcut partitions for minor-free graphs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of constructing shortcut partitions in minor-free graphs and using them to obtain improved algorithms for several problems on minor-free graphs. Some key questions and problems addressed in the paper are:

- Can we construct shortcut partitions for broader classes of graphs beyond planar graphs, such as minor-free graphs? Shortcut partitions were previously only known for planar graphs.

- Can shortcut partitions for minor-free graphs be used to resolve the Steiner Point Removal (SPR) problem and obtain a constant distortion SPR solution for minor-free graphs? The SPR problem has been open even for planar graphs. 

- Can shortcut partitions for minor-free graphs lead to improved distance oracles and tree covers for minor-free graphs compared to prior work? Prior constructions relied on heavy tools like Robertson-Seymour decomposition.

- Can shortcut partitions give the first deterministic low-distortion embeddings of apex-minor-free graphs into bounded treewidth graphs? Prior results only gave high polynomial treewidth.

So in summary, the key focus is on constructing shortcut partitions for minor-free graphs and leveraging them to obtain several improved algorithmic results for minor-free and apex-minor-free graphs. The paper makes progress on long-standing open problems like the SPR problem by devising a novel shortcut partition construction.
