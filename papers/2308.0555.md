# [Shortcut Partitions in Minor-Free Graphs: Steiner Point Removal,   Distance Oracles, Tree Covers, and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0555)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can shortcut partitions be constructed for minor-free graphs, beyond just planar graphs? The notion of shortcut partitions was recently introduced by Chang et al. (2022). They showed how to construct shortcut partitions for planar graphs and gave several applications, including improved tree covers. However, their construction relied heavily on planarity.This paper shows how to construct shortcut partitions for the more general class of minor-free graphs, thereby overcoming the "planarity barrier." The main result is:Theorem 1.1: Any edge-weighted Kr-minor-free graph admits an (ε,2O(r log r)/ε)-shortcut partition for any ε∈(0,1).This resolves the open question of whether shortcut partitions can be constructed for minor-free graphs. The techniques involve a novel deterministic variant of the cop decomposition for minor-free graphs. The shortcut partition construction then enables several applications for minor-free graphs, including:- Optimal distance oracles (resolving an open problem)- Improved tree covers- Resolving the Steiner Point Removal problem for minor-free graphsSo in summary, the central research question is whether shortcut partitions can be constructed beyond planar graphs, and this paper provides an affirmative answer by devising a construction for general minor-free graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is constructing a shortcut partition for minor-free graphs, in particular $K_r$-minor-free graphs. The notion of shortcut partition was recently introduced by Chang et al. (2022). Roughly speaking, a shortcut partition is a clustering of the vertices where between any pair of vertices u and v, there exists a low-hop path in the cluster graph. The key highlights are:- The authors construct an (ε, 2^{O(r log r)}/ε)-shortcut partition for any edge-weighted $K_r$-minor-free graph. This resolves an open question of extending the shortcut partition framework beyond planar graphs. - The construction breaks away from previous planarity-exploiting techniques for planar graphs. Instead, it is based on a novel deterministic buffered cop-decomposition for minor-free graphs.- Using the new shortcut partition, the authors resolve the Steiner Point Removal problem for minor-free graphs, by providing a general reduction from shortcut partitions to SPR.- The shortcut partition yields several other applications including: the first optimal distance oracle for minor-free graphs, improved tree covers, and additive embeddings for apex-minor-free graphs.Overall, this paper makes significant progress on constructing and applying shortcut partitions to minor-free graphs. The buffered cop-decomposition technique is an important contribution for tackling these non-planar graphs.
