# [We Choose to Go to Space: Agent-driven Human and Multi-Robot   Collaboration in Microgravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Future space exploration requires effective collaboration between humans and robots to carry out missions under microgravity conditions. However, acquiring robot skills and collaboration strategies for microgravity is challenging to simulate on Earth. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors develop a system called SpaceAgents-1 to learn robot skills and human-multi-robot collaboration (HMRC) for tasks inside a space station cabin under microgravity conditions. The key components are:

- SpaceSim: A simulation platform with microgravity physics, 3 types of robots (free-flying, rail, dexterous), and an interface for real-to-sim human control using computer vision.

- SpaceAgents: A hierarchical multi-agent system for HMRC, consisting of a Decision-Making Agent (DMA) that handles high-level planning and collaboration, and Skill-Expert Agents (SEAs) that manage embodied control for each robot type. The agents utilize foundation models for planning, memory, action selection etc.

- Working flow: DMA performs collaborative task planning and allocation using generated collaboration graphs. SEAs decompose subtasks into executable skill chains. Actors invoke RL-learned skills to control robots. Discriminators evaluate task completion.

Demonstrations:
The system is shown capable of long-horizon HMRC tasks like rearranging floating objects and transporting objects across modules using human-robot teams. Comparisons to human teleoperation show the benefits of learned microgravity skills.

Main Contributions:
1) SpaceSim platform for microgravity robotics simulation
2) Hierarchical multi-agent HMRC system driven by foundation models 
3) Demonstrations of long-horizon human-robot team manipulation tasks under simulated microgravity conditions

The proposed system aims to explore a potential approach to enable more effective human-robot collaboration for future space exploration tasks under microgravity conditions.
