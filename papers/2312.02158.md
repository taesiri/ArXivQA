# [PaSCo: Urban 3D Panoptic Scene Completion with Uncertainty Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02158)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes the novel task of Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC), which aims to jointly predict the complete geometry, semantics, and instances of a 3D scene from a sparse observation. The authors introduce a method called PaSCo that employs an efficient ensemble approach inspired by multi-input multi-output (MIMO) techniques to boost both PSC performance and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, PaSCo utilizes multiple subnets that take different augmented versions of the input point cloud and output multiple PSC variations. These are combined using a custom permutation-invariant mask ensembling strategy to produce the final PSC with uncertainty information. Experiments on three large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PaSCo achieves state-of-the-art PSC performance and provides valuable voxel-wise and instance-wise uncertainty estimates. The method is shown to surpass existing SSC techniques adapted with 3D panoptic segmentation across almost all metrics. Overall, this work presents the first formulation and method for the task of PSC, while concurrently assessing predictive uncertainty through an efficient ensembling approach using minimal additional computation.
