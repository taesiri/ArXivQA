# [Pushing Mixture of Experts to the Limit: Extremely Parameter Efficient   MoE for Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05444)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research goal of this paper is to explore how Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can be applied in an extremely parameter-efficient setting for instruction tuning of large language models. The key research questions seem to be:

1) Can MoE models be effectively used for instruction tuning when only a very small subset of parameters (less than 1%) are trainable? 

2) How do extremely parameter-efficient MoE models compare to standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like (IA)^3 and LORA in an instruction tuning setting across various model scales?

3) Can these lightweight MoE models match the performance of full fine-tuning of all parameters on unseen evaluation tasks?

4) What are the best practices and design choices for building parameter-efficient MoEs, in terms of routing mechanisms, number of experts, adapter types, etc.?

The central hypothesis appears to be that a mixture of lightweight adapters/experts can capture specialized skills and routing can effectively combine their outputs to yield strong performance, even when only a tiny fraction of parameters are updated. The paper seems to systematically evaluate this hypothesis through extensive experiments and ablations.

In summary, the core research focus is on pushing MoE architectures to an extreme level of parameter-efficiency for instruction tuning and evaluating whether they can match or exceed standard methods despite only updating less than 1% of parameters. The paper examines this question thoroughly through empirical analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an extremely parameter-efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that can achieve competitive performance to full fine-tuning while only updating a tiny fraction of parameters (less than 1%) of large language models. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing Mixture of Vectors (MoV) and Mixture of LORA (MoLORA), which are lightweight and modular MoE architectures that leverage parameter-efficient adapters like (IA)^3 vectors and LORA as experts.

- Demonstrating that MoV and MoLORA consistently outperform standard parameter-efficient methods like (IA)^3 and LORA across diverse unseen tasks, while being far more parameter-efficient. For example, MoV with 30 experts improves over (IA)^3 by 14.57% on average while only using 0.68% parameters on a 3B model.

- Showing that MoV and MoLORA can match the performance of full fine-tuning of large models (e.g. 11B T5) on unseen tasks by only updating less than 1% of parameters. This makes training computationally efficient.

- Conducting extensive ablations on model sizes, routing mechanisms, number of experts etc. to provide insights into optimizing MoE architectures in limited parameter settings.

Overall, the paper pushes MoE architectures to an extreme level of parameter efficiency and demonstrates their viability for instruction tuning of large language models in practical settings with constrained compute. The proposed methods enable strong performance on diverse unseen tasks through lightweight mixture of experts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes extremely parameter-efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models for instruction tuning of large language models. By using lightweight adapter modules as experts and soft routing, the method achieves strong performance on unseen tasks while only updating a tiny fraction of parameters (less than 1%) compared to full fine-tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other research on Mixture of Experts and parameter-efficient fine-tuning:

\begin{itemize}
\item This paper focuses on pushing MoE to an extreme degree of parameter efficiency by using lightweight adapter-based experts. Most prior work on MoE uses full replicas of model layers/blocks as experts, which incurs a large increase in parameters. Using lightweight adapters makes the proposed MoE framework very practical.

\item The paper shows strong results by fine-tuning only <1\% of parameters on large 11B models. This demonstrates that MoE can work well even under severe parameter constraints. Most prior MoE papers focus on adding experts during pretraining rather than fine-tuning.

\item The instruction tuning setup with multiple diverse tasks helps improve generalization and stability compared to single-task fine-tuning common in many prior adapter papers. The authors show consistent gains over dense adapters by using MoE, highlighting the benefits of mixtures in multi-task learning.

\item The token-based routing strategy removes the need for explicit task-ids during training. Many prior MoE and adapter methods rely on task-specific routing. The proposed token routing seamlessly generalizes to unseen tasks.

\item The paper provides extensive ablations on adapter types, number of experts, routing methods, etc. This gives useful insights into making MoE work under low-resource constraints, an under-explored area.

\item The proposed methods are compatible with other efficiency techniques like pruning, distillation, quantization for further gains. Many papers focus exclusively on a single efficiency approach. The flexibility of this work is a notable advantage.

\end{itemize}

In summary, this paper pushes MoE research in a very practical direction through rigorous experimentation under parameter and compute constraints. The consistent gains over dense adapters and generalization to unseen tasks are useful contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing the mixture of experts (MoE) approach on decoder-only models like GPT, as the current work focused only on encoder-decoder models like T5.

- Exploring the efficacy of MoE during pre-training, as the current work only studied MoE for fine-tuning. 

- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of tasks beyond text-to-text.

- Combining the proposed MoE methods with other efficiency techniques like model compression, quantization, etc. to further reduce computational costs.

- Studying how to stabilize the training of MoEs, as they are known to be sensitive to hyperparameters. More investigation is needed into techniques like batch size, learning rate schedules, etc.

- Analyzing in more depth how the experts specialize, such as through visualization of attention patterns, probing tasks, etc. This could provide more insight into the model behaviors.

- Scaling up the studies to even larger models beyond 11 billion parameters, to continue pushing the limits of efficient MoEs.

- Comparing to other related methods like adapter fusion, prompt tuning, etc. to better understand tradeoffs.

Overall, the authors propose an extensive research agenda around pushing mixture of experts to greater efficiency and broader applicability across models, tasks, and techniques. Their work opens up many exciting avenues for follow-on research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes extremely parameter-efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures by combining MoE with lightweight parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Specifically, they introduce Mixture of Vectors (MoV) and Mixture of LoRA (MoLORA) which use very small trainable vectors or low-rank matrices as experts in the MoE framework. This allows the model to leverage the benefits of conditional computation from MoE while only updating a tiny fraction of parameters (less than 1%) during fine-tuning. The methods are evaluated on instruction tuning using tasks from the P3 dataset and consistently outperform standard PEFT techniques like (IA)^3 and LoRA across various model sizes up to 11B parameters. Remarkably, with less than 1% parameter updates, the MoV and MoLORA architectures match or exceed the performance of full fine-tuning of the entire model. Benefits in terms of training and inference efficiency are also highlighted. Overall, the work underscores the effectiveness of MoE even under extreme parameter constraints and the versatility of the MoE architecture for delivering robust performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes extremely parameter-efficient Mixture of Experts (MoEs) for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to combine MoE architecture with lightweight parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like (IA)^3 vectors or LORA adapters as the experts. This allows leveraging the benefits of MoEs like conditional computation and inference efficiency while overcoming the huge parameter overhead of traditional MoEs that make them impractical for most users. The proposed methods called Mixture of Vectors (MoV) and Mixture of LORA (MoLORA) are evaluated on instruction tuning using the P3 dataset across various T5 model sizes. The results show they consistently outperform the baseline PEFT methods like (IA)^3 and LORA by a significant margin while updating less than 1% of parameters of a 11B model. Remarkably, with only 0.3-0.9% parameter updates, MoV and MoLORA reach performance on par with full fine-tuning across diverse unseen tasks. Extensive ablations analyze the impact of various design choices like routing mechanisms, number of experts, token vs sentence level routing.

In summary, the key contributions are i) introducing extremely lightweight and practical MoEs by combining MoE architecture with PEFT methods ii) showing strong performance of these methods for instruction tuning across model sizes iii) extensive analysis to develop insights about how to effectively design and optimize such systems. The proposed recipe pushes MoEs to realistic limited computational budgets without compromising performance, highlighting their versatility even under strict constraints. This can expand the applicability of conditional computation with MoEs to everyday practitioners working with large pre-trained LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper presents an extremely parameter-efficient approach to apply Mixture of Experts (MoE) for instruction tuning of large language models. The key contributions are:

1) They introduce lightweight parameter-efficient adapters called Mixture of Vectors (MoV) and Mixture of LoRA (MoLORA) as experts in the MoE architecture. Unlike standard MoE which uses full feedforward networks as experts, their method only updates a small fraction of parameters (less than 1% of a 11B model).

2) They demonstrate strong performance of MoV and MoLORA on a diverse set of 12 unseen tasks, consistently outperforming standard parameter-efficient methods like (IA)^3 and LORA across varying model sizes from 770M to 11B parameters. Using just 30 vector experts, MoV improves 14.5% over (IA)^3 on T5-3B model.

3) Their extremely parameter efficient MoE achieves competitive performance to full fine-tuning of all parameters, despite updating less than 1% parameters. MoV with just 10 experts matches full fine-tuning of T5-3B model on 8 unseen tasks.

4)They present in-depth ablation studies analyzing the effect of different design choices like token vs sentence embeddings for routing, soft vs hard expert selection, number of experts etc. to provide insights into optimizing MoE in constrained settings.

Overall, the key novelty is successfully applying MoE for instruction tuning in a severely parameter-limited environment through lightweight mixture of adapters, and showing strong generalization ability to diverse unseen tasks. The method enables MoE-style conditional computation at a fraction of typical resource costs.
