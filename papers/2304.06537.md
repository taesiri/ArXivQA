# [Transfer Knowledge from Head to Tail: Uncertainty Calibration under   Long-tailed Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06537)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to calibrate classification models trained from long-tailed distributions when the test data follows a balanced distribution. 

Specifically, the paper explores the problem of calibration under long-tailed distributions, where the training and validation data follow a long-tailed distribution but the test data is balanced. This causes issues for traditional calibration methods like temperature scaling, which assume the validation and test data come from the same distribution. 

The key hypothesis is that transferring knowledge from head (majority) classes to tail (minority) classes can help estimate the balanced distribution of tail classes for calibration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel importance weight-based strategy for calibrating models trained under long-tailed distributions. The key points are:

- The paper explores the problem of calibration under long-tailed distributions, where the training and validation data follow a long-tailed distribution but the test data is balanced. This is an important but rarely studied problem. 

- To tackle the distribution mismatch between training/validation and test data, the paper applies an importance weighting strategy to re-weight the instances from tail classes. This helps enhance the estimation of tail classes for more accurate calibration.

- The paper proposes to model the distribution of each class as a Gaussian and transfer knowledge from head classes to tail classes to estimate the target probability density of tail classes. This allows estimating importance weights for tail class instances.

- Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, MNIST-LT and ImageNet-LT show the proposed method outperforms existing calibration techniques under long-tailed distributions.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an importance weighting based calibration method that transfers knowledge from head to tail classes to deal with the long-tailed distribution mismatch, which is shown to be effective through experiments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for calibrating classification models trained on long-tailed datasets by estimating importance weights to rebalance the validation set distribution before temperature scaling, where the weights are computed by modeling each class distribution as a Gaussian and transferring knowledge from head to tail classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of model calibration under long-tailed distributions:

- This paper focuses specifically on the problem of calibrating models trained on imbalanced, long-tailed datasets, where the training data follows a long-tailed distribution but the test data is balanced. This is an important practical problem, but most prior work on calibration assumes balanced training and test data. So this paper addresses an underexplored problem setting.

- The proposed method uses importance weighting to rebalance the validation set used for calibration, by estimating target densities for tail classes based on head classes. This is a novel approach compared to prior calibration methods like temperature scaling or binning, which do not account for distribution differences.

- The idea of transferring knowledge from head to tail classes has been explored for improving long-tailed classification accuracy. But this paper is one of the first to adapt that idea specifically for calibration. The use of Wasserstein distance to measure tail/head similarity is also novel.

- Experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR, MNIST, ImageNet) and models demonstrate strong improvements in calibration metrics like ECE over baselines. The most comparable baselines are standard calibration methods like temperature scaling, which perform much worse on this problem.

- Most related domain adaptation calibration methods require some unlabeled target domain data, which is unavailable in this problem setting. So those cannot be applied. This work solves calibration without needing any target domain labels.

In conclusion, this paper makes both a problem statement contribution by studying an underexplored practically relevant setting, as well as a methodological contribution with the proposed knowledge transfer calibration approach. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate clear benefits over natural baselines. This work advances the state-of-the-art in calibration under distribution shift.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The main future research directions suggested in the paper are:

- Exploring regularization methods to compensate for the imbalanced influences of head and tail classes when training calibrated models under long-tailed distributions. The current work focuses on post-processing calibration, but the authors suggest also looking into modifying the training objective to get calibrated models directly.

- Applying the proposed calibration method to other tasks with long-tailed distributions, such as object detection and segmentation. The current work focuses on image classification, but the calibration issue also exists in other vision tasks.

- Estimating the optimal temperature in a parameter-efficient way. The current method requires searching for the best temperature on a held-out validation set. More efficient approaches could be explored. 

- Developing calibration techniques that do not rely on held-out validation sets. The distribution shift issue arises because current methods use a separate validation set that does not match the test distribution. Methods that are less reliant on validation sets could help.

- Evaluating the proposed method on larger scale and more complex datasets. The current experiments are on relatively small image classification datasets. Testing on larger and more complex datasets like ImageNet could reveal further challenges.

In summary, the main future directions are applying the calibration method to other tasks and setups, developing more efficient calibration techniques, and reducing reliance on validation sets. Exploring calibrated training is also suggested as an important direction for future work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for calibrating classification models trained on long-tailed datasets, where a few head classes dominate the training data while tail classes have very few examples. Traditional calibration techniques treat all classes equally, but fail to generalize from long-tailed training data to balanced test data. The proposed method uses importance weighting to rebalance tail classes for calibration. Specifically, it models class distributions as Gaussians, estimates balanced target densities for tail classes by transferring knowledge from head classes, and computes importance weights as the ratio of target to source densities. 

Experiments on CIFAR-10-LT, MNIST-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT show the method effectively calibrates various models including ResNet, DenseNet, VGG, and LeNet. It reduces calibration error metrics like ECE substantially compared to prior art. Ablation studies verify the importance of transferring knowledge from multiple similar head classes rather than just the most similar one. The method is also analyzed theoretically using Renyi divergence. In summary, the paper presents a novel knowledge transfer approach to address the challenging problem of uncertainty calibration under long-tailed distributions.
