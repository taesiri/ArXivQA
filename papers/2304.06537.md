# [Transfer Knowledge from Head to Tail: Uncertainty Calibration under   Long-tailed Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06537)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to calibrate classification models trained from long-tailed distributions when the test data follows a balanced distribution. 

Specifically, the paper explores the problem of calibration under long-tailed distributions, where the training and validation data follow a long-tailed distribution but the test data is balanced. This causes issues for traditional calibration methods like temperature scaling, which assume the validation and test data come from the same distribution. 

The key hypothesis is that transferring knowledge from head (majority) classes to tail (minority) classes can help estimate the balanced distribution of tail classes for calibration.
