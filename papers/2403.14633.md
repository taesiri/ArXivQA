# [Born With a Silver Spoon? Investigating Socioeconomic Bias in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14633)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Socioeconomic bias is a major issue in society that exacerbates inequalities and hinders inclusive progress. However, socioeconomic bias in large language models (LLMs) is an under-explored area of research. 

- This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit socioeconomic bias and if they are able to empathize with the struggles of the socioeconomically underprivileged.

Methodology:
- The authors introduce a new dataset called SilverSpoon containing 3,000 samples of hypothetical scenarios involving underprivileged people taking ethically questionable actions out of necessity. 

- The samples are annotated by people on opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum to get dual perspectives.

- Several LLMs of varying sizes are evaluated on SilverSpoon in a zero-shot setting to analyze their degree of socioeconomic bias.

Key Findings:
- Most LLMs fail to understand the challenging conditions faced by the underprivileged and do not empathize with them.

- Alpaca exhibits disagreement with annotations from the lower end of the spectrum.

- Larger models like GPT-3 exhibit slightly more empathy than smaller models. But model size alone does not determine degree of bias.

Main Contributions:
- First dual-perspective annotated dataset SilverSpoon to analyze socioeconomic bias in LLMs

- First comprehensive analysis showing LLMs' inability to empathize with the underprivileged

- Analysis of impact of model size on degree of socioeconomic bias

The paper provides a starting point for further research on an important but under-explored area regarding bias in LLMs.
