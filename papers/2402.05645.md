# [Investigating Reproducibility in Deep Learning-Based Software Fault   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05645)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the increasing adoption of complex deep learning models in software engineering research, concerns have been raised about the reproducibility of published results. Recent studies have shown issues with reproducing results in AI research in general. This paper investigates the reproducibility of research applying deep learning for software fault prediction in particular. Fault prediction is an essential software engineering task and many deep learning techniques have been proposed for it recently. 

Methodology:
The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 56 papers on deep learning for software fault prediction published at top software engineering conferences between 2019-2022. They extracted information from the papers related to key aspects that impact reproducibility: availability of source code, details on hyperparameter tuning, availability of datasets, and documentation of evaluation procedures.

Key Findings:
- 73% of papers provide links to source code repositories, but only 64% link to accessible repositories with model code.
- Crucially, 75% of papers with code repositories are missing code for baseline models used in evaluation.
- Only 14% provide code for hyperparameter tuning and tuning details for baselines are largely undocumented. 
- 70% rely on public datasets, but links are provided in only 60% of cases. Dataset preprocessing details are incomplete in many cases.
- All papers describe evaluation methodology, but only 15% provide statistical significance testing.

Conclusions:
The analysis reveals some positive trends regarding awareness of reproducibility, with most papers sharing model code. However, critical gaps exist regarding artifacts needed to reproduce key aspects of the experimental evaluation, especially details on baselines and tuning. This hampers exact reproducibility and measuring true progress. The authors conclude that further awareness and explicit incentives are needed to improve reproducibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the reproducibility of deep learning-based software fault prediction research by systematically reviewing 56 papers from top software engineering conferences published between 2019-2022 and finds major gaps in sharing artifacts to enable independent verification of reported results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the current state of reproducibility of scientific research in the domain of deep learning-based software fault prediction. Specifically, the authors reviewed 56 research articles published between 2019-2022 in top software engineering conferences and recorded various aspects related to reproducibility such as availability of source code, hyperparameters, datasets, evaluation details, etc. Their analysis revealed that while around two-thirds of papers provide code for the proposed models, crucial elements for reproducibility are missing in most cases, such as code for data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, baseline models, etc. The paper calls for improved research practices to ensure reproducibility of machine learning-based research in the software engineering domain.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic assessment of the reproducibility level of current research on deep learning-based software fault prediction, which highlights major gaps that need to be addressed, combined with recommendations on how to improve the situation.

The paper conducts a systematic review to investigate the reproducibility of deep learning-based research in the field of software fault prediction. It examines aspects like the availability of source code, details related to hyperparameter tuning, datasets, and evaluation procedures reported in recent papers. The goal is to analyze if enough information is provided to reproduce the results claimed in these papers. So the main focus is on reproducibility in the context of deep learning and software fault/defect/bug prediction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper conducts a systematic literature review to analyze the reproducibility of deep learning based software fault prediction techniques. What are some limitations of using a systematic literature review for this purpose compared to other methods like surveys or interviews with researchers?

2) One of the inclusion criteria is that papers must be published between 2019-2022 in selected top software engineering conferences. What is the rationale behind only considering recent papers? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of focusing the analysis only on top venues?  

3) The authors identify and define 16 different reproducibility variables that capture different aspects like code availability, hyperparameters, datasets etc. On what basis were these variables selected? What principles or frameworks from the literature guided the selection process?

4) The authors only consider the explicit documentation provided in the papers and code repositories when measuring the reproducibility variables. What are some potential issues with relying only on explicit documentation without actually attempting to reproduce the results?

5) The analysis reveals major gaps in reproducibility, especially regarding baseline models and hyperparameter tuning. To what extent could these gaps be due to authors following problematic practices like insufficient tuning or copying baseline results? What evidence exists to support or refute this?

6) The authors discuss various measures like reproducibility guidelines and checklists to improve reproducibility. What are some challenges and open research questions regarding the feasibility and efficacy of such guidelines in practice? 

7) The analysis focuses exclusively on code and artifacts shared by authors and does not evaluate intrinsic model factors affecting reproducibility. What are some examples of such factors and what methods can be used to analyze them?

8) One of the major findings is that only one paper conducts online experiments with human subjects. What unique reproducibility challenges exist with online evaluation compared to offline experiments?

9) The sample contains 56 papers on deep learning based software fault prediction. Is this sample size sufficient to reliably characterize and make generalizable conclusions about the entire subfield? What analyses could strengthen the conclusions?

10) The authors identify gaps in reproducibility and argue progress is hindered without it. To what extent is lack of reproducibility actually indicative of or caused by lack of progress? What evidence can disentangle or relate these two aspects?
