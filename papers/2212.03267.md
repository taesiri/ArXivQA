# [NeRDi: Single-View NeRF Synthesis with Language-Guided Diffusion as   General Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03267)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we synthesize novel views of a 3D scene from a single input image, without requiring multi-view supervision?

The key hypothesis is that leveraging general image priors from large-scale 2D image datasets, in the form of diffusion models, can help address the ill-posed and ambiguous nature of novel view synthesis from a single image. 

Specifically, the paper proposes to optimize a neural radiance field (NeRF) to match the distribution of views rendered from it to the distribution captured by the diffusion model, while constraining it to match the input view. It introduces techniques like textual inversion and depth regularization to narrow down the image prior distribution based on the input image, so the novel views remain coherent.

The overall goal is to develop a framework that can generate realistic and consistent novel views for arbitrary in-the-wild images in a zero-shot generalized manner, without needing multi-view supervision. Experiments on DTU and internet images seem to validate their approach and show advantages over existing supervised techniques.
