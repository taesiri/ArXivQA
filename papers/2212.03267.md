# [NeRDi: Single-View NeRF Synthesis with Language-Guided Diffusion as   General Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03267)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we synthesize novel views of a 3D scene from a single input image, without requiring multi-view supervision?

The key hypothesis is that leveraging general image priors from large-scale 2D image datasets, in the form of diffusion models, can help address the ill-posed and ambiguous nature of novel view synthesis from a single image. 

Specifically, the paper proposes to optimize a neural radiance field (NeRF) to match the distribution of views rendered from it to the distribution captured by the diffusion model, while constraining it to match the input view. It introduces techniques like textual inversion and depth regularization to narrow down the image prior distribution based on the input image, so the novel views remain coherent.

The overall goal is to develop a framework that can generate realistic and consistent novel views for arbitrary in-the-wild images in a zero-shot generalized manner, without needing multi-view supervision. Experiments on DTU and internet images seem to validate their approach and show advantages over existing supervised techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel framework for zero-shot single-view NeRF synthesis for in-the-wild images without 3D supervision. 

2. Leveraging general image priors from pre-trained 2D diffusion models and applying them to 3D NeRF generation conditioned on a single input image.

3. Designing a two-section semantic guidance (image caption + textual inversion embedding) to narrow down the image prior distribution based on the input image, enforcing semantic and visual coherence between synthesized views. 

4. Introducing a geometric regularization term based on estimated depth maps to facilitate NeRF optimization.

5. Demonstrating high-quality novel view synthesis results on the DTU dataset, outperforming existing supervised methods. Also showing generalization capability to diverse in-the-wild images.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage powerful image priors from 2D diffusion models for 3D NeRF synthesis from a single image, by properly conditioning the diffusion process on semantic and visual features from the input via a two-section text embedding. This allows high-quality novel view rendering without 3D supervision. The estimated depth map provides additional geometric regularization.
