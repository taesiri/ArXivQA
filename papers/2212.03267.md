# [NeRDi: Single-View NeRF Synthesis with Language-Guided Diffusion as   General Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03267)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we synthesize novel views of a 3D scene from a single input image, without requiring multi-view supervision?

The key hypothesis is that leveraging general image priors from large-scale 2D image datasets, in the form of diffusion models, can help address the ill-posed and ambiguous nature of novel view synthesis from a single image. 

Specifically, the paper proposes to optimize a neural radiance field (NeRF) to match the distribution of views rendered from it to the distribution captured by the diffusion model, while constraining it to match the input view. It introduces techniques like textual inversion and depth regularization to narrow down the image prior distribution based on the input image, so the novel views remain coherent.

The overall goal is to develop a framework that can generate realistic and consistent novel views for arbitrary in-the-wild images in a zero-shot generalized manner, without needing multi-view supervision. Experiments on DTU and internet images seem to validate their approach and show advantages over existing supervised techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel framework for zero-shot single-view NeRF synthesis for in-the-wild images without 3D supervision. 

2. Leveraging general image priors from pre-trained 2D diffusion models and applying them to 3D NeRF generation conditioned on a single input image.

3. Designing a two-section semantic guidance (image caption + textual inversion embedding) to narrow down the image prior distribution based on the input image, enforcing semantic and visual coherence between synthesized views. 

4. Introducing a geometric regularization term based on estimated depth maps to facilitate NeRF optimization.

5. Demonstrating high-quality novel view synthesis results on the DTU dataset, outperforming existing supervised methods. Also showing generalization capability to diverse in-the-wild images.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage powerful image priors from 2D diffusion models for 3D NeRF synthesis from a single image, by properly conditioning the diffusion process on semantic and visual features from the input via a two-section text embedding. This allows high-quality novel view rendering without 3D supervision. The estimated depth map provides additional geometric regularization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for zero-shot single-view NeRF synthesis of in-the-wild images without 3D supervision by leveraging general image priors from 2D diffusion models, using a two-section semantic text guidance and geometric regularization to enforce semantic, visual, and geometric coherence between views.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to related work:

- This paper presents a novel method for single-image novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Most prior work on single-view NeRF relies on learning strong priors from datasets of matched multi-view images. In contrast, this paper uses general image priors from an image diffusion model to optimize the NeRF, requiring only a single input view.

- The key idea is to use the pre-trained image diffusion as an unsupervised loss to optimize the NeRF parameters, by enforcing that renderings of the scene at novel views follow the distribution captured by the diffusion model. This is a clever way to leverage powerful generative image models to guide 3D scene optimization.

- The authors design a two-part conditioning input to the diffusion model that combines an image caption for overall semantics with a text embedding from textual inversion to capture visual details. This helps ensure consistency between views. Most prior work does not consider fusing semantic and visual guidance.

- Additional novelty comes from using estimated depth regularization, while properly accounting for ambiguity in monocular depth estimation. This improves geometry coherence.

- Compared to ShapeNet-trained models, this approach generalizes better by leveraging generic image priors. Compared to adversarial training methods, it provides more control via the textual guidance. The results demonstrate high visual quality even without 3D training data.

- Limitations include reliance on pre-trained components, difficulty modeling complex scenes, and bias from the image diffusion model. But overall, the work presents a unique approach to single-image NeRF synthesis with tangible benefits over existing methods. It opens interesting research directions in combining generative image models with 3D representations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different conditioning inputs besides text for the image diffusion model. The authors mainly use text captions and embeddings in this work, but suggest trying other modalities like sketches or spatial layouts as conditioning. This could help provide additional constraints for the diffusion model.

- Extending the framework to larger scenes with more complex image configurations. The current method works well for object-centric images but may face challenges when applied to scenes with greater view dependencies and occlusions. Modifications may be needed to handle more complex scene semantics. 

- Incorporating camera intrinsics into the geometric regularization. The authors note that camera intrinsics like focal length can impact the 3D geometry prediction, so calibrating for intrinsics could improve results. 

- Adding more rigorous geometric constraints like parallelism, orthogonality, and symmetry. The depth correlation loss provides some geometric regularization but more explicit constraints may further improve multiview consistency.

- Addressing model biases inherited from the pretrained components. Any biases in the image diffusion model, depth estimator, etc. can propagate errors in the NeRF synthesis. Mitigation strategies could help increase robustness.

- General training improvements like using larger NeRF network capacity, bigger diffusion models, multi-stage training procedures, and more training data. Scaling up various components could potentially improve results.

So in summary, the main directions are exploring alternative conditioning modalities, extending to more complex scenes, incorporating more rigorous geometry, addressing model biases, and scaling up the various components involved. The framework offers a lot of potential for future work to build on.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for single-view novel view synthesis of 3D scenes using neural radiance fields (NeRF). The key idea is to leverage large-scale 2D image diffusion models as priors to guide the optimization of NeRF parameters from a single input view. Specifically, the method represents the 3D scene as a NeRF and optimizes its parameters to match the input view while minimizing a diffusion model loss on renderings from arbitrary novel views. To narrow down the broad image prior distribution, a two-section text prompt is generated from the input - an overall caption plus a text embedding that captures fine details via textual inversion. This semantic conditioning focuses the diffusion model on views coherent with the input. Additionally, a depth correlation loss is used to regularize the geometry. Experiments on the DTU dataset show higher quality results than supervised baselines despite no dataset training. The method also demonstrates generalizable novel view synthesis on diverse in-the-wild images. The main contributions are using image diffusion priors for single-view 3D generation, designing an input-specific text conditioning approach, and incorporating geometric regularization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a method for single-view novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs). The key idea is to leverage general image priors from pretrained 2D image diffusion models to optimize the NeRF representation for an input image, without requiring multi-view supervision. 

Specifically, the method represents the 3D scene underlying an input image as a NeRF. It then optimizes the NeRF parameters by minimizing a diffusion loss that pushes novel view renderings to follow the distribution of a pretrained image diffusion model. To relate the generic image prior to the input, it extracts a two-part semantic conditioning input using the image caption and textual inversion of the input image. This provides overall semantics as well as visual cues to shape the image distribution prior. Additionally, a depth correlation loss on an estimated depth map of the input view acts as a geometric regularizer. Experiments on the DTU dataset show the method synthesizes higher quality novel views than existing supervised methods. It also demonstrates realistic novel views for diverse in-the-wild images.
