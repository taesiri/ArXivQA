# [HumanoidBench: Simulated Humanoid Benchmark for Whole-Body Locomotion   and Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10506)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper introduces HumanoidBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating whole-body control algorithms on simulated humanoid robots. The key motivation is that despite the promise of humanoid robots to assist humans across diverse environments, progress has been hindered by costly and unsafe real-world experimental setups. 

To accelerate research, the authors present a high-dimensional simulated environment featuring a humanoid robot equipped with two dexterous Shadow Hands. The benchmark consists of 15 whole-body manipulation tasks like unpacking a truck, wiping windows, playing basketball, and 12 locomotion tasks like walking, crawling, traversing slides. The tasks are designed to require sophisticated coordination of the robot's body parts over long time horizons.

The benchmarking results demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms struggle to solve most of the tasks. This poor performance is attributed mainly to the complexity induced by high-dimensional state and action spaces representing the humanoid and its hands. An additional challenge is the need for long-term planning. To mitigate these issues, the authors demonstrate a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach, where a high-level policy leverages pretrained robust low-level policies for skills like walking and reaching. This scheme achieves significantly improved performance on manipulation tasks.

In conclusion, the HumanoidBench simulator and task suite provide the research community an invaluable testbed for identifying challenges and developing new algorithms tailored to whole-body control problems unique to humanoid robots. The open-source platform facilitates prompt verification of ideas to unlock the immense potential of humanoids in real-world human environments.
