# [TVQA: Localized, Compositional Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01696)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on presenting a new video question answering (VQA) dataset called TVQA and providing baseline experiments and models for this new dataset. Specifically:

- The paper introduces the TVQA dataset, which contains over 150K question-answer pairs on 21K video clips from 6 popular TV shows. The key features of TVQA highlighted are:

1) It is large-scale and contains natural videos with rich dynamics and social interactions. 

2) The video clips are relatively long (60-90 secs) with associated dialogues.

3) The questions are compositional, requiring localization of relevant moments as well as multimodal understanding.

- The paper analyzes the dataset statistics and properties. It also compares TVQA to other existing VQA datasets.

- The paper proposes two VQA tasks on this dataset - QA on grounded clips and QA on full clips. It provides several baseline methods and a multi-stream end-to-end neural network model.

- Experiments are presented comparing the baselines and the proposed model. The best result is achieved by the multi-stream model jointly using subtitles, regional visual features, and visual concept features.

In summary, the central research contribution is the introduction and analysis of the new TVQA dataset for multimodal video QA, along with baseline experiments and models as a benchmark for future work. The paper focuses on dataset construction and empirical methodology more than novel technical contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the TVQA dataset, which is a large-scale video question answering dataset based on 6 popular TV shows. The key advantages of TVQA highlighted in the paper are:

- It contains 152,545 human-written QA pairs from 21,793 video clips spanning over 460 hours of video. This makes it a large-scale and natural video QA dataset.

- The video clips are relatively long at 60-90 seconds, containing more social interactions and activities compared to previous video QA datasets. 

- The questions are compositional, consisting of a main question and a temporal grounding part (e.g. "before", "after"). This encourages questions that require temporal reasoning and moment localization within the clips.

- The dialogue (character names + subtitles) is provided for each clip. Understanding the relationship between the dialogue and the questions/answers is crucial for answering many questions correctly.

- Timestamps are provided to localize the moments relevant to answering each question.

In addition to introducing the dataset, the paper also provides benchmark experiments and propose a multi-stream end-to-end neural network model for the video QA task on this dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of the large-scale, natural, temporally compositional, and multimodal TVQA dataset to spur further research progress in video question answering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces TVQA, a new large-scale video question answering dataset based on 6 popular TV shows, containing over 150K human-written QA pairs from 21K video clips, designed to require compositional understanding of both video and subtitle content in order to answer questions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research in video question answering:

- The paper introduces a new large-scale video QA dataset called TVQA, which is one of the largest to date with over 150K QA pairs from 21K clips spanning 460 hours of video. Other major video QA datasets are generally smaller in scale.

- TVQA uses natural videos from 6 popular TV shows across 3 genres. Other datasets often use movies, cartoons, or less natural video sources. Using realistic videos is advantageous for developing algorithms that can work in the real world.

- The questions in TVQA require understanding both the visual content in the videos as well as the dialogue subtitles. Many other datasets focus more on just visual or just textual reasoning. TVQA aims to be truly multimodal.

- The paper proposes a compositional question format with a main question and a temporal grounding part. This encourages complex questions requiring visual localization. Other datasets tend to have simpler question formats.

- The paper provides localization supervision with start/end timestamps for each question. Some other datasets like TGIF-QA also provide this, but many don't have temporal localization.

- The paper gives benchmark results for baselines as well as a multi-stream neural network model. Many other papers introduce a new dataset but do not thoroughly evaluate strong baselines on it.

Overall, the key distinguishing factors of this paper seem to be the scale, realism and multimodality of the TVQA dataset, as well as the effort to provide thorough analysis and baselines for the new dataset. The compositional questions are also an innovative component.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Enhancing the interactions between videos and subtitles to improve multimodal reasoning ability. They note that there is still a gap between the proposed models and human performance on QA accuracy, and improving video-subtitle interactions could help close this gap.

- Exploiting human-object relations in the videos and subtitles, as many of the questions involve such relations. 

- Integrating better temporal reasoning, as temporal cues are crucial for answering many of the compositional questions in the dataset.

- Exploring the question-driven moment localization task that is enabled by the timestamp annotations in the dataset, but not directly tackled in their experiments.

- Developing models that can better handle the variable-length answers in the dataset, as understanding these long answers is key.

- Incorporating more common sense knowledge and reasoning into models, as some errors seem to be due to the lack of general common sense.

- Exploring different multimodal fusion techniques to better leverage the different video, subtitle, and language modalities.

In summary, the key future directions focus on improving multimodal reasoning, temporal reasoning, variable-length answer modeling, common sense knowledge integration, and moment localization. Advancing models in these areas could significantly improve performance on this challenging video QA dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces TVQA, a new large-scale video question answering dataset built on 6 popular TV shows spanning 3 genres (sitcoms, medical dramas, crime dramas). The dataset contains 21,793 60-90 second video clips taken from 925 episodes and 461 hours of video. Each clip is associated with 7 freeform compositional questions, where the first part asks a question about the clip and the second part temporally grounds the question in the clip. In total there are 152,545 question-answer pairs collected. The authors argue previous video QA datasets have limitations in either relying too much on just visual or just textual information, using unrealistic video sources, or not requiring joint reasoning over vision and language. In contrast, TVQA requires understanding both the visual content of videos as well as the subtitle-based dialogue to answer many questions. The authors introduce tasks of QA on the full clips as well as the temporally localized segments, and provide baseline experiments using variants of a multi-stream end-to-end neural network model. When using the full context, the best model achieves 66.46% accuracy on the test set. The dataset and leaderboard are publicly available to encourage further research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces TVQA, a large-scale video question answering dataset based on 6 popular TV shows spanning 3 genres: sitcoms, medical dramas, and crime shows. The dataset contains 152,545 QA pairs from 21,793 video clips, totaling over 460 hours of video. The questions are designed to be compositional, requiring systems to jointly localize relevant moments within a clip, comprehend subtitle-based dialogue, and recognize relevant visual concepts in order to answer. Each question consists of two parts - a main question and a grounding part that localizes the relevant moment. Timestamps for start and end times are provided for each question. 

The paper presents analyses of the dataset, baselines, and a multi-stream end-to-end trainable neural network framework. Experiments demonstrate that both visual and textual understanding are necessary for the TVQA task. Results show the best performance is achieved by a model jointly taking videos, subtitles, and questions/answers as input. However, there is still a significant gap compared to human performance, indicating room for improvement. The paper concludes that future work could focus on enhancing video-text interactions for better multimodal reasoning and incorporating temporal reasoning. The new multimodal QA dataset provides a benchmark for developing stronger models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents TVQA, a large-scale video question answering dataset based on 6 popular TV shows spanning over 460 hours of video. The key aspects of the dataset are:

- It contains 152,545 QA pairs from 21,793 long video clips (60-90 secs). Each clip has 7 questions written by humans after watching the videos. 

- The questions are compositional, consisting of a main question and a temporal grounding part (e.g. before/after/when) to localize the relevant moment. Timestamps are provided for each question.

- The videos come with aligned subtitles containing character names and dialogues. Understanding both the visual content and dialogues is key to answering many questions.

- The questions are multiple choice with 1 correct and 4 human-written wrong answers.

The authors introduce a multi-stream end-to-end neural network model to utilize different context sources - video frames, subtitles, detected objects/attributes. These are encoded using LSTMs and jointly modeled with the question and answers using context matching. Experiments show combining both subtitles and videos leads to the best performance of 66.46% on the test set, demonstrating the multimodal nature of the dataset. Overall, the TVQA dataset provides a challenging and more realistic video QA benchmark requiring joint language and vision understanding.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are trying to address is the lack of large-scale, realistic video question answering datasets that require multimodal understanding. Specifically:

- Most existing video QA datasets are limited in scale and focus on short video clips. This paper introduces a large-scale video QA dataset based on long video clips from TV shows. 

- Many existing video QA datasets rely on unrealistic videos like cartoons or overly simplistic questions. This paper collects QA pairs by having real people ask questions while watching TV shows, resulting in more natural and complex questions requiring multimodal reasoning.

- Previous datasets tend to focus on either visual or textual reasoning alone. This paper aims to create a dataset requiring understanding and reasoning over both visual content in videos and textual content in subtitles/dialogues. The compositional question format encourages multimodal questions.

- The paper argues existing video QA datasets lack comprehensiveness in the types of reasoning skills needed to answer the questions. Their goal is to create a dataset that tests a diverse range of question types beyond basic recognition, tapping into abilities like temporal reasoning, causal relations, social dynamics, etc.

In summary, the main problem is the lack of a large, naturalistic video QA dataset requiring complex multimodal reasoning, and this paper introduces the TVQA dataset to fill that gap. The compositional questions, rich contexts, scale, and diversity aim to push multimodal understanding.
