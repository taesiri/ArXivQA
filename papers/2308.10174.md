## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we design an end-to-end neural network model that allows efficient human-AI interaction for accurate multi-person 2D keypoint annotation?The key hypothesis appears to be:By incorporating pose error modeling and an interactive human feedback loop into the training and inference of a end-to-end keypoint detection model, it can enable efficient annotation of accurate 2D human poses with minimal manual efforts.Specifically, the paper proposes two main technical contributions:1. Pose error modeling during training to make the decoder robust to typical pose errors and learn to self-correct based on correct keypoints.2. An interactive human feedback loop that allows users to correct predicted keypoints during inference, and iteratively updates the pose estimates based on the corrections.The overall goal is to develop an interactive framework called Click-Pose that integrates human inputs with an end-to-end deep model for efficient and accurate multi-person keypoint annotation. The experiments aim to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Click-Pose for in-domain, out-of-domain, and new keypoint annotation scenarios.In summary, the core research question is about designing an interactive neural framework for efficient 2D human pose annotation by combining human intelligence with machine learning models. The key ideas are pose error modeling and an interactive feedback loop to enable minimal manual correction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a novel framework for interactive keypoint detection called Click-Pose. The main contributions are:1. It proposes the new task of interactive keypoint detection, which aims to obtain accurate keypoint annotations with minimal user interaction. This can significantly reduce the time and cost of annotation compared to manual labeling.2. It introduces two key techniques: pose error modeling and an interactive human-feedback loop. Pose error modeling enhances the decoder's robustness by training it to correct typical pose errors. The human-feedback loop allows users to correct predicted keypoints, and the model refines other keypoints based on this feedback.3. Extensive experiments validate Click-Pose's effectiveness for efficient annotation. It achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end keypoint detection and requires much fewer user clicks to reach target precision compared to prior methods. It reduces annotation time by over 10x versus manual labeling.4. Click-Pose shows advantages for in-domain, out-of-domain, crowded scene, and new keypoint annotation. It also enables adapting the model to new keypoints with minimal labeled data.In summary, this paper presents a novel interactive framework that combines human feedback with an end-to-end keypoint detector for faster, cheaper, and more flexible annotation. The introduced techniques improve the model's robustness and interactivity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of this interactive approach over prior annotation strategies.
