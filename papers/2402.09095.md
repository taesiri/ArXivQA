# [FedSiKD: Clients Similarity and Knowledge Distillation: Addressing   Non-i.i.d. and Constraints in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) faces challenges with non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) client data, which can reduce model performance and convergence. 
- Clients or edge devices also have hardware and computational constraints that limit their ability to train complex models locally.
- Existing FL methods take many communication rounds to reach good accuracy, posing bandwidth overhead and greater risk of model exploitation.

Proposed Solution:
- FedSiKD -  A framework that incorporates similarity-based clustering of clients with knowledge distillation (KD) within a federated learning setting. 
- Clients initially securely share data distribution statistics like mean, standard deviation, and skewness to the server.
- Server uses k-means clustering to group clients into clusters based on dataset similarity.
- Within each cluster, a leader "teacher" client is selected to train a complex model. Other "student" clients train smaller models using KD to transfer knowledge from the teacher model while avoiding heavy compute requirements. 
- Cluster models are aggregated to update the global model.

Contributions:
- Clients share data stats instead of raw data to preserve privacy and tackle non-i.i.d challenges.
- Similarity-based clustering enhances intra-cluster data distribution homogeneity.  
- Knowledge distillation allows teacher-student model paradigm within clusters to address client computational constraints.
- Convergence analysis proves faster model convergence. 
- Experiments show high performance gains over baselines, especially in highly skewed non-i.i.d settings. 25\% and 18\% accuracy gains on HAR and MNIST datasets respectively.
- 17-20\% higher accuracy than baselines in first 5 rounds, indicating early-stage learning proficiency.
