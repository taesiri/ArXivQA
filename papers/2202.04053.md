# [DALL-Eval: Probing the Reasoning Skills and Social Biases of   Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04053)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper appears to be introducing a new benchmark dataset called PaintSkills for evaluating visual reasoning skills in text-to-image generation models. 

The key contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a set of 3 visual reasoning skills that are important for text-to-image generation: object recognition, object counting, and spatial relation understanding.

- Creating a simulated 3D environment and generating a new dataset called PaintSkills with over 50K images to evaluate these skills. The images are generated from textual prompts describing the visual reasoning skills.

- Evaluating several recent text-to-image models like DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion on this PaintSkills benchmark and analyzing their abilities and limitations in the visual reasoning skills.

So in summary, the paper introduces a new benchmark and methodology for systematically evaluating and analyzing visual reasoning in text-to-image models, rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The key research question seems to be: How well do current text-to-image models exhibit visual reasoning abilities like object recognition, counting, and spatial relations when evaluated on this new PaintSkills benchmark?
