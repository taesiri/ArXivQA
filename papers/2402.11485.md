# [LEIA: Facilitating Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in Language Models   with Entity-based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adapting large English language models (LLMs) to other languages via continued pretraining (language adaptation) is becoming popular, but knowledge transfer from English is limited.
- Existing language adaptation methods overlook the benefits of cross-lingual supervision to facilitate better knowledge transfer.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce LEIA, a lightweight language adaptation method that utilizes Wikipedia entity names aligned across languages.  
- Augment the target language Wikipedia corpus by inserting English entity names next to hyperlinks.
- Fine-tune LLM on this corpus with left-to-right language modeling objective.
- The English names provide cross-lingual supervision, enabling the model to apply its English knowledge about entities to the target language.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate LEIA enhances cross-lingual transfer and significantly improves performance of 7B parameter LLMs on question answering in diverse non-English languages.
- Show gains over fine-tuning on plain Wikipedia, confirming benefits of inserted English entity names.
- Show that even a massively bilingual LLM can further benefit from LEIA.
- Analyze that gains are mainly from English names providing informative context rather than just targets to predict.

In summary, the paper introduces a lightweight yet effective language adaptation method called LEIA that leverages cross-lingually aligned Wikipedia entity names to better facilitate knowledge transfer from English to other languages. Experiments across various languages and models demonstrate clear performance improvements in question answering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LEIA, a method to facilitate cross-lingual knowledge transfer in language models by augmenting the target language corpus with English entity names aligned via Wikipedia inter-language links and fine-tuning the model using left-to-right language modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LEIA, a lightweight fine-tuning method that facilitates cross-lingual knowledge transfer in language models. Specifically, it involves augmenting the target language corpus (such as Wikipedia) with English entity names aligned via inter-language links, and training the language model using this augmented corpus. Evaluations on question answering datasets across several languages demonstrate that models fine-tuned with LEIA significantly outperform baseline models, showcasing the effectiveness of cross-lingual knowledge transfer through the proposed method.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Language adaptation tuning - The paper focuses on methods for adapting pretrained language models to new languages.

- Cross-lingual knowledge transfer - A key goal is facilitating knowledge transfer from a source language (English) to target non-English languages.  

- Entity-based data augmentation - The proposed LEIA method augments text with English entity names to enable better cross-lingual transfer.

- Wikipedia - Wikipedia text and hyperlinks, along with inter-language links, are used as a source of data augmentation and evaluation.

- Question answering - Performance is evaluated on a diverse set of question answering datasets in multiple languages.

- Multilingual language models - Experiments leverage the English LLaMA 2 model and English-Japanese Swallow model to demonstrate LEIA's language adaptation capabilities.

- Commonsense knowledge transfer - One hypothesis is that inserting entity names allows transfer of commonsense and world knowledge across languages.

In summary, key terms cover language adaptation, cross-lingual transfer, data augmentation, Wikipedia, question answering, multilingual models, and commonsense knowledge. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does LEIA leverage inter-language links in Wikipedia to facilitate cross-lingual knowledge transfer? Explain the data augmentation process.

2. What are the two ways in which the inserted English entity names can enhance training - as labels to predict or as contexts? How did the authors determine which one was more impactful?

3. What was the motivation behind using left-to-right language modeling as the training objective? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? 

4. The authors test LEIA on top of two base models - LLaMA 2 and Swallow. What are the key differences between these models in terms of architecture, training data and objectives?

5. How does the performance of LLaMA 2 + LEIA compare to Swallow + LEIA? What inferences can be made about the extent of cross-lingual transfer facilitated by LEIA?

6. For low-resource languages like Hindi and Swahili, LEIA shows enhanced performance on X-CODAH but not on X-CSQA. What could be the reasons behind this?

7. The authors mention applicability of their approach to other forms of cross-lingual supervision besides Wikipedia. What are some options and how can the framework be extended?

8. What downstream tasks beyond question answering could potentially benefit from cross-lingual transfer facilitated by LEIA? What evaluations could be done to test this?

9. Error analysis: On which languages and datasets does LEIA underperform base models or show negligible improvements? What could be the reasons?

10. The paper focuses only on knowledge transfer from English to other languages. How can bidirectional transfer between multiple languages be enabled through this framework?
