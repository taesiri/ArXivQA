# [Rethinking Mobile Block for Efficient Attention-based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01146)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is:"Can we build a lightweight Inverted Residual Block (IRB)-like infrastructure for attention-based models with only basic operators?"The key points are:- Inverted Residual Blocks (IRBs) are recognized as the core infrastructure for lightweight CNN models. However, there is no counterpart for attention-based models. - The paper aims to develop a lightweight IRB-like block for attention-based models, using only basic operators like depthwise convolutions and multi-head self-attention.- The goal is to integrate the efficiency of lightweight CNNs like MobileNet with the modeling capability of Transformers, resulting in an easy-to-use and high-performance mobile-friendly model.- To achieve this, the paper inductively abstracts a Meta Mobile Block that can instantiate IRB, Transformer blocks, etc. based on two parameters. - It then deduces an Inverted Residual Mobile Block (iRMB) from this meta block using efficient operators like depthwise conv and improved multi-head attention.- Finally, a lightweight attention-based model called Efficient MOdel (EMO) is built using only the iRMB blocks in a ResNet-like architecture.In summary, the core research question is about developing a MobileNet IRB-like infrastructure for attention models using basic building blocks, in order to get an efficient yet accurate mobile-friendly model. The iRMB and EMO are proposed to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new building block called the Meta Mobile Block (MMB) for designing lightweight and efficient models. The MMB is an abstraction and unification of the Inverted Residual Block from MobileNets and the MHSA/FFN modules from Transformers. 2. Using the MMB, the authors deduce a novel Inverted Residual Mobile Block (iRMB) that only uses depthwise convolutions and an improved efficient window multi-head self-attention (EW-MHSA). 3. The iRMB is used to build a new lightweight model called Efficient MOdel (EMO) for computer vision tasks. EMO uses only iRMBs in a ResNet-like architecture.4. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show EMO variants (EMO-1M to EMO-5M) achieve excellent performance compared to other lightweight CNN and Transformer models, with fewer parameters and FLOPs.5. The paper provides detailed ablation studies and analysis, offering insights into designing efficient attention-based models.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the MMB abstraction to unify efficient blocks from CNNs and Transformers, enabling the design of the new high-performance EMO model using only iRMBs. The simplicity yet effectiveness of EMO demonstrates the power of the MMB design principle.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a lightweight Meta Mobile Block infrastructure for attention-based models by extending the idea of CNN's efficient Inverted Residual Blocks, and uses it to build a simple yet effective Efficient MOdel (EMO) that achieves strong performance on image classification and dense prediction tasks with low parameters and FLOPs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work in efficient vision models:- It proposes a new Meta Mobile Block that unifies inverted residual blocks from CNNs and the MHSA/FFN blocks from Transformers into a common framework. This is a novel contribution not explored in prior work. - The paper builds lightweight models called EMOs using only the deduced inverted residual mobile blocks (iRMBs). Many recent papers use more complex or heterogeneous modules, while EMO sticks to a simple uniform building block.- Experiments show EMO models surpass or match state-of-the-art efficient CNN and Transformer models. For example, EMO-1M outperforms MobileNetV3 and MobileViT despite using simpler blocks.- The inverted residual design in EMO allows it to be more hardware friendly and achieve higher throughput compared to models like EdgeNeXt. The paper demonstrates big speedups on mobile hardware.- The approach focuses on designing from first principles rather than using techniques like distillation or neural architecture search. This sets it apart from many concurrent works.- For downstream tasks, EMO integrated with detectors and segmentors continues to show advantages over other mobile-friendly models. This underscores the general effectiveness of the approach.In summary, the paper makes both novel inductive modeling contributions and demonstrates competitive empirical performance versus related work on efficient vision models. The simplified and uniform design based on iRMBs differentiates EMO from many existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my understanding of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring more complex operators like transposed channel attention, multi-scale Res2Net, and efficient Performer to further improve model effectiveness and push the limits of efficient model design. The authors mention these operators may help but need more thorough experimentation.- Training the models on higher resolution inputs, larger datasets like ImageNet-21K, and incorporating stronger training strategies like distillation from heavy models and advanced augmentations. The authors state this could lead to further performance improvements.- Applying neural architecture search to automatically find optimal model configurations rather than relying on manual design. - Deploying the models on more downstream tasks beyond image classification, object detection and segmentation to expand their application.- Further improving the mobile runtime efficiency and reducing latency through optimizations like quantization, pruning, and compiler-based methods.- Exploring attention mechanisms beyond the window-based multi-head self-attention used in this work to see if other attention variants can work well.- Studying how to better incorporate inductive biases like convolution into the attention-based models to ease optimization.- Comparing the inverted residual mobile blocks proposed to other MobileNet-like architectures to analyze tradeoffs.In summary, the main future directions are pushing the accuracy and efficiency of the attention-based mobile models further through architecture advances, training improvements, and additional applications. The simple yet effective approach proposed provides a strong baseline for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes an efficient inverted residual mobile block (iRMB) for attention-based models by unifying ideas from convolutional neural networks and Transformers. It inductively abstracts a Meta Mobile Block that can describe inverted residual blocks, multi-head self-attention, and feedforward networks using parametric arguments. Based on this, the iRMB is deduced which contains depthwise convolution and an expanded window multi-head self-attention module. Using only iRMBs, an Efficient MOdel (EMO) is designed for dense prediction tasks. Experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show EMO variants achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency trade-offs compared to other lightweight CNN and Transformer models. The simple yet effective design provides insights into building powerful and efficient attention-based models.
