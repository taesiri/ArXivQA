# [Forensic Iris Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04125)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes the first conditional StyleGAN-based model for synthesizing realistic forensic iris images exhibiting post-mortem interval (PMI)-specific iris texture deformations. Trained on over 8,000 images from 338 subjects, the model can generate full-resolution synthetic images matched to statistics of authentic post-mortem samples, including ISO/IEC iris image quality metrics and comparison score distributions produced by a state-of-the-art forensic iris recognition method. Notably, the model can generate same-identity samples from the StyleGAN latent space to mimic genuine score distributions. The synthetic images capture intricate iris texture and cornea deformations across various PMIs, offering applications in advancing iris recognition and presentation attack detection research. The paper shares the trained model, codes, and a dataset of 180,000 synthetic post-mortem iris images with 18 PMI ranges. Key capabilities include controlling identity (same or different) and synthesis of images exhibiting statistically representative forensic iris traits and comparison scores for a given PMI. This promises to greatly facilitate future research by alleviating the challenge of scarce post-mortem iris data.
