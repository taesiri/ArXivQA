# [Respect the model: Fine-grained and Robust Explanation with Sharing   Ratio Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing XAI methods lack faithfulness to the model and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, questioning their reliability in explaining model decisions. 
- They analyze models at the neuron level, overlooking intricate nonlinear interactions between neurons to form concepts. 
- They focus on post-activation values, overlooking inactive neurons that also provide information.

Proposed Solution:
- Present Sharing Ratio Decomposition (SRD) method to decompose relevance of a pointwise feature vector (PFV) comprising preactivation neurons sharing a receptive field.  
- Derive high-resolution effective receptive fields (ERFs) at any layer by recursive decomposition of a PFV into constituent PFVs.
- Handle contributions to both active and inactive neurons by using preactivation values. 
- Rely solely on model-generated information without any corrections to enhance robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce novel concepts of PFV and ERF for vector perspective to account for nonlinear neural interactions.
- Discover Activation-Pattern-Only Prediction showing significance of inactive neurons.  
- Propose SRD for recursive PFV decomposition to obtain ERFs and relevance at any layer.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance across localization, complexity, faithfulness and robustness metrics.
- Enable local to global explanation spanning model's decision process.
- Enhance robustness by purely reflecting model's inference without any corrections.

In summary, the paper presents SRD for faithful and robust explanation via recursive vector decomposition. By deriving high-resolution ERFs, it also enables comprehensive local to global explanation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "Pointwise Feature Vector (PFV)". What is a PFV and why does analyzing models at the PFV level rather than individual neurons better account for nonlinear interactions between filters?

2. The paper proposes a new metric called "Sharing Ratio (SR)". What exactly is the SR quantifying in the context of PFVs between layers? How is it used to decompose relevance scores between layers? 

3. The paper mentions an "Activation-Pattern-Only Prediction (APOP)" phenomenon. What is APOP and what implication does it have on what kinds of information are important for a model's predictions?

4. How exactly does the proposed SRD method calculate effective receptive fields (ERFs) for PFVs? What is the significance of having high resolution ERFs?

5. What is the equivalence proof between the forward and backward passes of the SRD method showing? Why is it important to show this equivalence?

6. How does the recursive decomposition process of PFVs across layers provide hints into the global decision-making process of models? What kinds of insights can this decomposition provide?

7. Why does the consideration of contributions to inactive neurons in SRD improve faithfulness and robustness compared to other methods? 

8. The paper argues that SRD explanations are more robust to adversarial attacks. What is the intuition behind why finely reflecting the model's actual computations improves robustness?

9. How does the ability to flexibly target different layers in SRD allow for versatile local versus global explanations compared to other CAM methods?

10. The paper mentions SRD can provide insights into "where", "what", and "how" models make decisions. Can you expand on what kinds of insights each of those correspond to and how SRD enables them?
