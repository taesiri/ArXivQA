# [Hierarchical Prompts for Rehearsal-free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Hierarchical Prompts for Rehearsal-free Continual Learning":

Problem:
- Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on non-stationary data from a sequence of tasks. Specifically, fine-tuning the model on new tasks leads to a severe deterioration in performance on past tasks.
- Existing continual learning methods like regularization-based, exemplar-based, and dynamic architecture-based still experience substantial forgetting or increasing computational costs.
- Recently proposed prompt-based methods mitigate forgetting by updating only a small set of prompt parameters. However, the learned prompts tend to focus solely on new task knowledge while ignoring past tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes a novel rehearsal-free paradigm called Hierarchical Prompts (H-Prompts) to overcome catastrophic forgetting in prompts.
- H-Prompts consists of three components:
   1) Class prompt: Models each class distribution using a Bayesian neural network to preserve past class knowledge.
   2) Task prompt: Integrates class prompt knowledge and current task knowledge to remember both past and present. 
   3) General prompt: Learns generalized knowledge via self-supervised pretext tasks.
- During training, Bayesian Distribution Alignment aligns distributions between real and virtual (past) samples to obtain class prompts.
- Cross-task Knowledge Excavation incorporates current and virtual sample knowledge into the task prompt. 
- Generalized Knowledge Exploration conducts rotation prediction on current samples to update the general prompt.
- For inference, a task-aware query-key mechanism selects the optimal prompt components for each sample.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel hierarchical prompt structure to overcome catastrophic forgetting by preserving past task knowledge, learning current task knowledge, and acquiring generalized knowledge.
- Introduces Bayesian Distribution Alignment to model each class distribution using BNNs and obtain virtual samples for past classes.
- Presents Cross-task Knowledge Excavation to integrate current and past class knowledge into the task prompt.
- Applies self-supervised pretext tasks to learn generalized representations within the general prompt. 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on class incremental learning benchmarks, averaging 87.8% on Split CIFAR-100 and 70.6% on Split ImageNet-R.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel hierarchical prompts approach for continual learning that comprises class prompts to model class distributions, task prompts to capture past and current task knowledge, and general prompts to learn generalized knowledge, in order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel rehearsal-free paradigm called Hierarchical Prompts (H-Prompts) for continual learning to overcome the catastrophic forgetting of prompts. H-Prompts consists of class prompt, task prompt, and general prompt.

2) It presents three key techniques as part of H-Prompts: 

(a) Bayesian Distribution Alignment to model the distribution of classes in each task with class prompts to preserve past task knowledge. 

(b) Cross-task Knowledge Excavation to integrate past task knowledge replayed by class prompts with current task knowledge into the task prompt. 

(c) Generalized Knowledge Exploration to perform self-supervised learning on the general prompt to obtain generalized knowledge.

3) Evaluations on Split CIFAR-100 and Split ImageNet-R benchmark datasets show that H-Prompts achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing rehearsal-free continual learning methods. This demonstrates the efficacy of H-Prompts in overcoming catastrophic forgetting in prompts.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the novel H-Prompts paradigm and associated techniques to address the prompt forgetting problem in rehearsal-free continual learning. Evaluations validate the effectiveness of H-Prompts.

The paper proposes a new rehearsal-free paradigm called Hierarchical Prompts (H-Prompts) for continual learning. It consists of three types of prompts - class prompt, task prompt, and general prompt. The goal is to overcome catastrophic forgetting in prompts during continual learning by modeling class distributions, capturing past and current task knowledge, and learning generalized knowledge using the three prompts respectively.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical prompts paradigm with three components: class prompt, task prompt, and general prompt. Can you explain the motivation and objective behind each of these components? How do they work together in the overall framework?

2. Bayesian Distribution Alignment is utilized to model class distributions with Bayesian neural networks. Why is this an effective strategy for preserving knowledge of past classes? How does aligning distributions in an adversarial manner help mitigate catastrophic forgetting? 

3. Cross-task Knowledge Excavation integrates past task knowledge replayed by class prompts with current task knowledge into the task prompt. What is the intuition behind this approach? Why can integrating knowledge across tasks improve continual learning performance?

4. For the general prompt, the paper applies a self-supervised learning strategy called Generalized Knowledge Exploration. Why might incorporating generalized knowledge obtained in a self-supervised manner help with catastrophic forgetting? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The inference strategy employs a task-aware query-key mechanism to select the appropriate task prompt and general prompt. Can you explain why this mechanism is more effective than a naive query-key approach? What extra information does it provide?

6. From the ablation study, it is clear all three prompt components make important contributions. Can you analyze the relative impacts of the class, task, and general prompts? Which seems most critical? Why?

7. One analysis explores the impact of using a shared vs separate general prompt across tasks. What differences might you expect between these two approaches? Why does the shared prompt deliver comparable performance?

8. The visualizations of class prompt representations show they align well with real image representations over time. What does this suggest about how well the distributions are captured? How might this alignment help reduce catastrophic forgetting?

9. Multiple hyperparameter analyses are provided exploring prompt lengths/depths. What trends can you identify regarding model performance as these parameters are varied? What are potential explanations for these observations? 

10. Can you discuss the broader impact and limitations of the proposed hierarchical prompts approach? What types of continual learning problems might it be well or poorly suited for? Why?
