## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate medical image segmentation is critical for various healthcare applications, but CNNs used for this task have limitations in capturing long-range relationships and global context. Transformers can model such global dependencies but struggle with image locality and translation invariance issues. Effectively integrating complementary features from CNNs and transformers while maintaining feature consistency remains a challenge. Most methods also focus solely on body features, neglecting the importance of edge information.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes BEFUnet, a novel U-Net-like network enhancing fusion of body and edge features for precise medical image segmentation. The main components are:

1) Dual-branch Encoder: Separate edge branch using Pixel-wise Convolution extracts fine edge details. Body branch uses hierarchical Transformer to capture global context.

2) Local Cross-Attention Feature (LCAF) Fusion: Accurately and efficiently fuses edge and body features using local cross-attention between spatially close image regions. Reduces complexity versus global cross-attention.  

3) Double-Level Fusion (DLF) Module: Employ cross-attention to fuse coarse semantic and fine localization information across scales.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel architecture effectively combining edge local details from CNN and global context from transformer, handling irregular boundaries.

2) Introduces LCAF for selective fusion of closely located cross-modal features, ensuring accuracy while reducing complexity.

3) DLF module enables effective multi-scale feature fusion, balancing semantics and localization.

Experiments conducted on 3 medical segmentation datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting robustness across variety of segmentation challenges. The model excels at precise boundary segmentation even for ambiguous, irregular cases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hybrid CNN-transformer network called BEFUnet for precise medical image segmentation, which enhances fusion of edge and body features through a dual-branch encoder extracting pixel differences and global contexts, a local cross-attention module selectively fusing spatially close cross-modal features, and a multi-scale transformer fusing coarse and fine representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces the concept of pixel difference convolution, which combines the strengths of traditional edge encoders and deep CNNs for robust and precise edge segmentation. 

2. It proposes a new medical image segmentation architecture called BEFUnet, which extracts both body and edge features and effectively integrates them using a local cross-modal fusion module (LCAF) and a double-level fusion (DLF) module to enhance segmentation performance.

3. It conducts comprehensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the proposed BEFUnet model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in accurately segmenting boundary-blurred, irregular, and interference-present organ regions while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the novel BEFUnet architecture that effectively fuses body and edge information using specialized modules (LCAF and DLF) for superior medical image segmentation performance compared to existing approaches.
