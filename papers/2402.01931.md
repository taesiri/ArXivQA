# [Digits micro-model for accurate and secure transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01931)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate speech recognition is critical for financial transactions conducted over the phone, but large general-purpose ASR models can make errors in digit recognition. This can lead to financial discrepancies or authentication failures.
- Sending data to external ASR APIs raises privacy concerns due to potential training on user data.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes creating smaller, specialized "micro" models focused on numeric digit recognition that can match or exceed the accuracy of general models while using fewer computational resources for training and deployment.  
- A new dataset is introduced for training models to handle varied pronunciation of multi-digit numbers, helping address limitations of existing datasets.

Methods:
- A dataset of 14,000 utterances spanning digit lengths up to 5 digits was created using the Timers and Such and LibriSpeech datasets. It covers diverse articulation of numbers.
- Two micro-models were trained using the Kaldi toolkit - a "Micro-model-dense" and simplified "Micro-model-light" network architecture.

Results: 
- The micro-models achieve lower word error rates (1.8-2.6%) compared to Whisper (4.6-5.8%) and Google Speech-to-Text (2.9%) while having faster runtimes and smaller memory footprints.
- The micro-models offer privacy benefits by enabling on-premise deployment rather than relying on external APIs.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated specialized micro-models can meet or exceed general ASR performance for focused numeric recognition tasks.
- Created and released a multi-digit speech recognition dataset with pronunciational diversity.
- Developed accurate and efficient micro-models for digit recognition suitable for privacy-sensitive financial use cases.
