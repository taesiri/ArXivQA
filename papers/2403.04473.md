# [TextMonkey: An OCR-Free Large Multimodal Model for Understanding   Document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04473)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extracting information from documents and scene text is important for automation, but has challenges: requires text detection/recognition, language understanding, and multimodality.  
- Existing methods have limitations:
  - OCR-based have error propagation, complexity, computational costs
  - OCR-free have resolution limitations or lose pretraining benefits

Proposed Solution - TextMonkey:  
- Adopts Shifted Window Attention to enable cross-window connectivity at higher resolutions, using sliding windows
- Proposes Token Resampler using similarity to filter redundant tokens from higher resolutions, preserving key tokens  
- Expands capabilities beyond QA to text spotting, grounding to enhance text positional understanding and reduce hallucination 
- Can be finetuned for clicking screenshots based on commands

Main Contributions:
- Cross-window connectivity maintains efficiency while boosting resolution 
- Token Resampler streamlines tokens from higher resolutions, enhancing performance
- Additional text-centric tasks improve spatial/positional understanding  
- Achieves SOTA results across multiple text QA/IE datasets, especially OCRBench score of 561, surpassing prior art

In summary, TextMonkey introduces novel techniques to efficiently process higher resolution images for document and scene text understanding, demonstrates expanded capabilities on positional tasks, and achieves leading performance across multiple benchmarks.
