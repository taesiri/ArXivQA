# [Towards Socially and Morally Aware RL agent: Reward Design With LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can behave in ways that don't align with human values and social/moral norms when pursuing their goals. This is because reward functions may not fully specify all desired and undesired behavior. As a result, RL agents may have negative side effects or unsafe exploration.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to provide auxiliary rewards that encode social and moral norms to guide RL agents. Specifically:

1) Use LLM to provide additional rewards during agent exploration to avoid negative side effects and encourage safe actions. LLM is prompted to score state-action pairs on a scale from -10 to 10 based on their social/moral acceptability.

2) Use LLM to compare full trajectories from a replay buffer and pick the most preferred one. Boost Q-values for actions in the preferred trajectory to push the policy towards better global behavior.  

3) Decrease likelihood of taking unsafe actions based on LLM scoring.

Experiments:
The methods are evaluated in 3 gridworld experiments with effects related to breaking social norms or moral values:

1) World with a vase the agent should avoid breaking. LLM rewards help avoid the vase.

2) World where avoiding killing a person is globally better than breaking multiple vases, though locally vases provide worse rewards. LLM trajectory comparison pushes behavior away from killing. 

3) World with public/private context where appropriateness of actions differs. LLM rewards encode social norms and guide appropriate behavior.

Main Contributions:
- New approach to integrate LLM knowledge about social/moral norms into RL via reward signals and trajectory comparisons 
- Empirical demonstration that this technique can mitigate negative side effects and lead to safer, more human compatible behavior.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to guide reinforcement learning agents towards more socially and morally acceptable behavior by using language models to provide auxiliary rewards reflecting human values and comparing agent trajectories to avoid locally optimal policies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals for reinforcment learning (RL) agents to help them explore safely and avoid negative side effects that go against social and moral norms. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution are:

1) Using the LLM to provide auxiliary rewards at each step to guide safe exploration. The LLM is prompted to judge if an action would be safe/unsafe or moral/immoral and provide a corresponding positive/negative reward. The agent then avoids potentially unsafe actions with some probability based on the reward.

2) Using the LLM after trajectories to pick globally optimal ones over locally optimal ones. The LLM compares entire trajectories and picks the most preferred one according to social/moral norms. The corresponding actions in that trajectory are then updated to be more preferable. 

3) Demonstrating through experiments in gridworlds that this approach allows the RL agent to avoid negative side effects, explore safely, and converge to globally optimal solutions that better adhere to social and moral values judged by the LLM.

In summary, the key contribution is using LLMs as flexible reward providers for RL agents to align them with human values and safety constraints.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Reward design
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Moral awareness
- Social norms
- Safe exploration
- Avoiding negative side effects
- 2D grid world environment
- Tabular Q-learning
- Language model as reward signal
- Replay buffer
- Context-dependent rewards

The paper explores using LLMs like GPT-3.5 to provide auxiliary reward signals to guide an RL agent towards more socially and morally desirable behavior in a simple 2D grid world environment. Key ideas examined are leveraging the LLM to enable safe exploration, avoid negative side effects, and align the agent with human values related to morality and social norms. The approach is evaluated on tabular Q-learning and utilizes concepts like prompting the LLM, acting with precaution, and using a replay buffer to pick better trajectories. Overall, the key terms reflect the goal of designing reward functions and training procedures to make RL agents adhere better to complex human values.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a language model to generate rewards for an RL agent to encourage safe and socially-aware behavior. What are some challenges or limitations in relying on a language model to accurately judge the appropriateness of actions in complex real-world scenarios?

2. The approach uses prompts to elicit value judgments from the language model. How might the phrasing of those prompts bias or skew the model's responses? Is there a principled way to construct neutral, unbiased prompts? 

3. Tabular Q-learning is used in the experiments for simplicity. How might the approach change if using a function approximator like a neural network? What additional considerations would come into play?

4. The paper evaluates avoiding negative side effects and unsafe exploration. Are there other aspects of social/moral behavior that would be important to measure as well in the experiments? What metrics could capture those? 

5. Could the use of language model rewards discourage the agent from learning itself what leads to appropriate behavior? How could the approach balance language model guidance with still allowing independent learning?

6. The paper uses a simple grid world environment. How might the approach fare in more complex environments like 3D simulations or the real world? Would the simplicity of the prompts to the language model still work?

7. What method is used to select which two trajectories to compare when using the replay buffer? Could the choice of trajectories to compare impact how quickly the agent converges to preferred behavior?

8. Does prompting the language model about hypothetical scenarios avoid issues with it refusing to judge specific situations? How reliable and consistent is this approach compared to asking about real experiences?

9. How sensitive is the approach to different language models used or their fine tuning? Would results differ substantially between models or training approaches?

10. The paper analyzes specific test cases qualitatively. To complement that, what quantitative metrics could also capture performance on avoiding negative side effects and unsafe exploration?
