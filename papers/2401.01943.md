# [Generalist embedding models are better at short-context clinical   semantic search than specialized embedding models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01943)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for various tasks in healthcare, raising critical questions about their robustness and reliability in such a sensitive domain. Specifically, their sensitivity to minor variations in input formatting and prompt phrasing needs to be better understood.

- The effectiveness of different embedding models for medical semantic search requires further benchmarking to identify optimal models and reasons for their performance.

Methodology:
- A dataset of 1000 reformulations of 100 ICD-10-CM code descriptions was generated using ChatGPT. 

- 19 embedding models (generalist and clinical-specialized) were benchmarked on retrieving the original ICD-10-CM code when passed the reformulated description. Models were constrained to be reproducible on a CPU and freely usable.

- Performance metrics: exact match, category match (first 3 code digits), total and incorrect character error rates (CER) between retrieved and original code.

Results: 
- Generalist models greatly outperformed specialized clinical models on all metrics. The top generalist model (jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) had 84.0% exact match rate versus 64.4% for the top clinical model (ClinicalBERT).

- Generalist models were also closer to ground truth codes even when incorrect, with lower incorrect CER.

- Sentence transformer models designed for short text performed the best. S-PubMedBERT, fine-tuned on additional general text, hugely outperformed the clinical PubMedBERT model.

Conclusions:
- Specialized clinical embedding models are more sensitive to small input changes compared to large generalist models. This could be from insufficient and non-diverse training data lacking basic language understanding critical even for medical text.

- Appropriate model design and training methodology along with sufficient scale and diversity of training data is key to an accurate and robust embedding model for clinical semantic search.

Main Contributions:
- Rigorous benchmarking of embedding model performance on a medical semantic search task evidencing sensitivity challenges of specialized clinical models

- Highlights need for sufficient scale, appropriate model design and diverse training data even for domain-specialized language tasks

- Reproducible framework to benchmark additional models to advance understanding of clinical NLP


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Generalist embedding models outperformed specialized clinical embedding models on a short-context clinical semantic search task, suggesting current specialized models may be more sensitivity to small input changes that confuse them, possibly due to insufficient diversity in their training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a benchmarking experiment that evaluates and compares the performance of different embedding models on a short-context clinical semantic search task. Specifically:

- The authors construct a dataset of ICD-10-CM code descriptions and reformulations to use for evaluating embedding models on a semantic search task of matching reformulated descriptions to original codes. 

- 19 embedding models are benchmarked, including both generalist models and those specialized for the clinical domain. Models were selected to be reproducible on a CPU and freely available.

- Performance metrics quantify the accuracy of models in exactly matching reformulations to original codes as well as closeness of incorrect matches.

- The key result is that generalist embedding models substantially outperform specialized clinical models on this semantic search task, suggesting current clinical models have greater sensitivity to input variations that impairs their search abilities. 

- The superior performance of generalist models is hypothesized to be because they have been trained on more diverse and larger datasets, enabling more robust language understanding even for medical texts.

In summary, the paper's main contribution is a reproducible benchmarking experiment that provides evidence generalist embedding models are currently better suited for short-context clinical semantic search tasks compared to specialized medical models.
