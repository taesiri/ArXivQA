# [Towards Unified Scene Text Spotting based on Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03435)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The main research goal is to develop an end-to-end scene text spotting method that can unify different text detection formats (e.g. quadrilateral, polygon, bounding box) into a single model. 

- The key hypothesis is that by using sequence generation with prompts and starting point guidance, a single model can handle multiple detection formats and also detect more text instances than the maximum length it was trained on.

- Specifically, the paper proposes a model called UNITS that uses:
  - Detection format tokens as prompts to allow generating different location formats.
  - Starting point prompting to detect texts beyond the max length limitation.
  - A multi-way transformer decoder to handle multiple formats.

- Experiments show UNITS achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks while providing the additional capabilities of unified formats and increased detection capacity.

In summary, the central research question is how to create a unified scene text spotting model that can handle diverse detection formats and detect more texts than its max length, which UNITS aims to address through sequence generation techniques.
