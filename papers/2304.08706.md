# [Looking Through the Glass: Neural Surface Reconstruction Against High   Specular Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08706)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to accurately reconstruct 3D object surfaces from multi-view images in the presence of high specular reflections (HSR). The key hypothesis is that decomposing the rendered image into a target object part and an auxiliary plane part can reduce the interference of HSR and allow more accurate reconstruction of the target object surface. Specifically, the paper proposes:- An auxiliary plane module to generate the appearance of the auxiliary plane representing planar reflectors based on physical assumptions, in order to enhance the appearance of the target object. - A framework named NeuS-HSR that combines a surface module (based on NeuS) to render the target object appearance and the proposed auxiliary plane module. The rendered image is a linear combination of the two appearances.- This decomposition and rendering framework with the auxiliary plane appearance physically modeled reduces ambiguity and enables more accurate reconstruction of the target 3D surface from multi-view images containing HSR.In summary, the central hypothesis is that decomposing the rendered image into target object and auxiliary plane appearances, where the latter is physically modeled, can overcome the limitations of prior work and enable accurate 3D reconstruction against HSR. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework, called NeuS-HSR, for reconstructing 3D object surfaces under high specular reflections (HSR). Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing to decompose the scene into a target object component and an auxiliary plane component to handle the interference of HSR. The auxiliary plane enhances the appearance of the target object.- Designing an auxiliary plane module to generate the appearance of the auxiliary plane in a physically plausible way. This is done by predicting the plane attributes using a neural network and applying a differentiable reflection transformation. - Achieving more accurate 3D object reconstruction from multi-view images with HSR compared to state-of-the-art methods like NeuS, as demonstrated by quantitative experiments on synthetic data and qualitative results on real data.In summary, the main contribution is the novel framework NeuS-HSR that can reconstruct 3D object surfaces more robustly against HSR by decomposing the scene and designing the auxiliary plane module in a physically motivated manner. This allows improving over previous methods struggling with HSR.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a novel framework called NeuS-HSR for reconstructing 3D object surfaces from images captured through glasses or with high specular reflections, by decomposing the scene into a target object component and an auxiliary plane component representing the planar reflector.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in 3D object surface reconstruction:- This paper focuses on a challenging scenario - reconstructing object surfaces under high specular reflections (HSR). Most prior work assumes Lambertian surfaces without strong reflections. The problem setup is novel.- The method uses an implicit neural representation to model the surface. This follows recent trends in using deep implicit models like NeRF for reconstruction. The novelty is in how they handle the HSR challenge.- They propose decomposing the scene into a target object and auxiliary plane to model the reflections. The auxiliary plane module is designed to separate out the target object appearance. This decomposition idea is unique to handle HSR.- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate superior reconstruction quality compared to other state-of-the-art implicit reconstruction methods like NeuS, UNISURF, VolSDF. This shows the benefit of the proposed approach for handling HSR.- A limitation is that it still suffers from ambiguities in unseen surfaces like other learning-based approaches. The results are not perfect.- Overall, this paper makes significant progress on the challenging problem of reconstruction under HSR by innovating on implicit neural scene decomposition. The problem, technical approach and results advance the state-of-the-art in this specific niche area.In summary, the key novelty of this paper is in tackling the complex HSR challenge via implicit neural decomposition. It demonstrates improved reconstruction ability in that setting compared to other recent works. The problem setup and technical innovations specifically for HSR are the main contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Extending their approach to handle glasses with different thicknesses. The current method is designed for scenes with planar reflectors like glass, but it could be adapted to account for varying glass thickness which impacts the degree of specular reflections. The authors suggest adding thickness as a parameter to the auxiliary plane module.- Applying the method to highly reflective object surfaces like cars. The core ideas could potentially generalize to reconstructing surfaces that themselves have high specularity, not just surfaces seen through reflecting glass.- Incorporating object symmetry priors to address reconstruction ambiguity in unseen surface areas. The ill-posed nature of novel view synthesis from limited inputs leads to incomplete geometry recovery. Assuming symmetry could help fill in missing information.- Exploring alternatives to the linear summation of target object and auxiliary plane appearances. The fixed weighted summation may not be optimal. Adaptive or learned fusion could improve rendering.- Reducing computational cost and memory requirements for wider practical use. For example, the hierarchical sampling strategy could likely be improved.Overall, the authors point to several interesting ways their approach could be extended and improved, like handling more complex reflectors, generalizing to reflective surfaces, exploiting shape priors, refining the image decomposition and fusion, and boosting efficiency. Advancing in these directions could make the method more robust and practical.
