# [Looking Through the Glass: Neural Surface Reconstruction Against High   Specular Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08706)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to accurately reconstruct 3D object surfaces from multi-view images in the presence of high specular reflections (HSR). The key hypothesis is that decomposing the rendered image into a target object part and an auxiliary plane part can reduce the interference of HSR and allow more accurate reconstruction of the target object surface. Specifically, the paper proposes:- An auxiliary plane module to generate the appearance of the auxiliary plane representing planar reflectors based on physical assumptions, in order to enhance the appearance of the target object. - A framework named NeuS-HSR that combines a surface module (based on NeuS) to render the target object appearance and the proposed auxiliary plane module. The rendered image is a linear combination of the two appearances.- This decomposition and rendering framework with the auxiliary plane appearance physically modeled reduces ambiguity and enables more accurate reconstruction of the target 3D surface from multi-view images containing HSR.In summary, the central hypothesis is that decomposing the rendered image into target object and auxiliary plane appearances, where the latter is physically modeled, can overcome the limitations of prior work and enable accurate 3D reconstruction against HSR. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework, called NeuS-HSR, for reconstructing 3D object surfaces under high specular reflections (HSR). Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing to decompose the scene into a target object component and an auxiliary plane component to handle the interference of HSR. The auxiliary plane enhances the appearance of the target object.- Designing an auxiliary plane module to generate the appearance of the auxiliary plane in a physically plausible way. This is done by predicting the plane attributes using a neural network and applying a differentiable reflection transformation. - Achieving more accurate 3D object reconstruction from multi-view images with HSR compared to state-of-the-art methods like NeuS, as demonstrated by quantitative experiments on synthetic data and qualitative results on real data.In summary, the main contribution is the novel framework NeuS-HSR that can reconstruct 3D object surfaces more robustly against HSR by decomposing the scene and designing the auxiliary plane module in a physically motivated manner. This allows improving over previous methods struggling with HSR.
