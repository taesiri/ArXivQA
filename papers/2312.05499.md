# [C*: A New Bounding Approach for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman   Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP). This is a generalization of the standard TSP where the targets move along known piecewise-linear trajectories and have associated time windows during which they must be visited. 
- The MT-TSP has applications in areas like surveillance, search/rescue, and tracking dynamic targets. However, literature on providing optimality guarantees for MT-TSP is limited, especially for the general case of piecewise-linear target trajectories.

Proposed Solution - Continuity* (C*):  
- The key idea is to relax the MT-TSP by allowing discontinuities in the agent's tour whenever it reaches a target. This is done by partitioning each target's trajectory into small sub-segments and allowing the agent to arrive/depart from any point within a sub-segment when visiting that target.
- A graph is constructed with the sub-segments as nodes grouped into clusters for each target. Edges represent feasible travel between sub-segments. Edge costs are obtained by solving a Shortest Feasible Travel (SFT) problem.  
- The relaxed problem poses an Generalized TSP (GTSP) on this graph. Solving the GTSP gives a lower bound on the optimal MT-TSP cost. As the number of sub-segments increases, the lower bounds converge to the MT-TSP optimal cost.

- Two variants are presented - C* uses optimal SFT costs, while C*-lite uses simpler & faster SFT lower bounds.

Contributions:
- A new bounding approach called C* that provides optimality guarantees for the MT-TSP under general piecewise-linear target trajectories.
- Introduction and algorithms to solve the SFT problem for computing edge costs.
- A computationally cheaper variant C*-lite using simpler SFT bounds. 
- Proofs that C* and C*-lite provide lower bounds to the MT-TSP.
- Computational results demonstrating tight lower bounds and runtime comparisons, including against state-of-the-art SOCP approach.
- Feasibility of constructing good MT-TSP solutions from the lower bounds in most test cases.
