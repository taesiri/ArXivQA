# [Constructing and Expanding Low-Resource and Underrepresented Parallel   Datasets for Indonesian Local Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indonesia has over 700 local languages but only 2.5% have open datasets available. Most resources are biased towards Western Indonesian languages, neglecting eastern and central regions with more diverse languages.  
- Local languages face challenges like limited documentation, lack of guidelines, digital divide. This hinders NLP research.  
- Building datasets for low-resource languages is difficult and costly.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced "Bhinneka Korpus", a new multilingual parallel corpus for 5 Indonesian local languages - Ambonesse Malay, Kupang Malay, Beaye, Makassarese and Uab Meto.
- Focused on central and eastern Indonesian languages that are underrepresented.
- Created the first bilingual lexicon for the underdocumented Beaye language. 
- Adopted a volunteer-based approach for data collection instead of professional annotators. 

Main Contributions:
- Presented corpus collection process and challenges for low-resource languages.
- Provided language overviews and taxonomy.
- Conducted rigorous double blinded evaluation. 
- Performed lexical and statistical analysis like Flesch-Kincaid readability, Shannon entropy diversity.
- Experimented with statistical machine translation using IBM Model 1.
- Released open datasets to facilitate future NLP research on these languages.

The paper makes notable contributions towards creating more inclusive NLP solutions by addressing limitations for understudied Indonesian local languages. The methods and analysis provide valuable insights that can guide development of resources for other low-resource languages as well.
