## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Diffusion-SS3D that utilizes a diffusion model to improve pseudo-label quality for semi-supervised 3D object detection. The key idea is to treat the task as a denoising process, where noisy object sizes and class label distributions are introduced and then gradually refined through the diffusion model's iterative sampling to output higher-quality bounding boxes. Specifically, the authors incorporate the diffusion model into a teacher-student learning framework commonly used in semi-supervised learning. In the teacher model, noisy object candidates are denoised via diffusion sampling to produce pseudo-labels. In the student model, noisy versions of the ground truth are used as training targets. Experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. For example, with only 5% labeled data on ScanNet, Diffusion-SS3D achieves over 5% higher mAP than prior arts. Additional analysis provides insights into diffusion model components and reveals the ability to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. Overall, the proposed diffusion perspective offers an effective way to improve pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised 3D detection.
