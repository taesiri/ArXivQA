# [The ART of LLM Refinement: Ask, Refine, and Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07961)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes ART (Ask, Refine, Trust), a method for improving the accuracy of large language models by using smaller auxiliary models to ask targeted questions, refine the initial generations, and select the best output.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a reasoning with refinement strategy called ART (Ask, Refine, and Trust) for large language models (LLMs). LLMs often struggle to accurately identify errors in their own generations, especially for reasoning tasks. ART works in three stages - first an Asker model asks questions to decide if the LLM's initial prediction needs refinement. If refinement is needed, the LLM performs the refinement step using the questions. Finally, a Trust model selects between the initial prediction and the refined response. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and question answering datasets show that much smaller models can be effectively trained to make good refinement decisions, outperforming larger LLM's own self-refinement abilities. The results demonstrate the usefulness of asking questions before refinement, and having separate smaller models make decisions about when and whether to refine. The authors show this is a more cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning large LLMs, while preserving strong reasoning performance.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a new reasoning with refinement strategy called ART (Ask, Refine, and Trust) for improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs). The authors find that self-refinement, where LLMs attempt to correct their own errors, often fails for reasoning tasks. To address this, ART uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) An "Asker" model asks a series of questions to evaluate if the LLM's initial prediction requires refinement. (2) A "Refinement" step is executed to improve the prediction based on the evaluation. (3) A "Truster" model selects between the refined result and the initial prediction. Experiments on mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and question answering (StrategyQA) show ART improves over self-refinement baselines by up to 5 points, even when using a much smaller Asker model. The authors demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of training smaller models for refinement decisions versus fine-tuning larger LLMs. They also find trained Truster models can better rank outputs than LLMs' self-selections. The results illustrate the value of using specialized models to make informed decisions about when and how to refine LLMs' generations.
