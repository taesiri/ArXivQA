# [Tired of Over-smoothing? Stress Graph Drawing Is All You Need!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10579)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we build deep graph neural networks (GNNs) without suffering from over-smoothing and performance deterioration? The key points are:- Existing methods for building deep GNNs to avoid over-smoothing have issues like redundancy, over-parameterization, and attributing effectiveness to unimportant components. - The root cause is a lack of understanding of how graph neural networks work geometrically through message passing.- The paper proposes using stress graph drawing concepts like attractive and repulsive forces to better understand GNN message passing.- This viewpoint helps design deep GNN models without over-smoothing, shows how to utilize repulsive information, and optimizes message passing to approximate full stress propagation.- Experiments on various tasks/datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed attractive/repulsive models and the relationship between stress iteration and GNNs.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using stress graph drawing concepts can lead to better designed and interpreted deep GNN models without over-smoothing issues. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
