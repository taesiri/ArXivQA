# [Visual Style Prompting with Swapping Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning images from text prompts, but have difficulty precisely controlling the style and visual elements. 
- Ambiguity in text prompts makes it hard to specify the exact desired style.
- Existing methods for style control via reference images require fine-tuning or cause issues like content leakage.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce visual style prompting to guide the style using a reference image while generating new content from a text prompt, without fine-tuning the diffusion model. 
- Propose swapping self-attention to keep queries from original features and swap keys/values with those from reference features in later self-attention layers. This transfers style while preventing content leakage.

Main Contributions:
- Swapping self-attention for visual style prompting without fine-tuning or content leakage.
- Analysis of which self-attention blocks are optimal to swap to balance style similarity, text alignment, diversity and preventing content leakage.
- Extensive evaluation showing the method reflects style elements well, matches text prompts accurately, and outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and in a user study.
- Compatibility with other techniques like ControlNet and Dreambooth. Can also use real images as references.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel training-free approach to control the style of images generated by text-to-image diffusion models using reference images. By swapping self-attention features, it transfers style elements without content leakage. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness for visual style prompting compared to existing methods.
