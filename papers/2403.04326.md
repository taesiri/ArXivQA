# [Edge-based Parametric Digital Twins for Intelligent Building Indoor   Climate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Building indoor climate is important for human comfort and building conservation. However, inappropriate operation of HVAC systems can lead to thermal comfort issues. 
- Relying solely on cloud computing for data analytics has drawbacks like latency and privacy concerns.
- There is a lack of integration between edge computing and digital twins to enhance understanding of building indoor climate.

Proposed Solution:
- An edge-centric solution combining edge computing, digital twins, and deep learning to model building indoor climate.
- Parametric digital twins created using ontology to ensure consistent data representation across diverse systems.
- Digital twin models and deep learning predictive models deployed on edge devices for low latency and privacy compliance. 
- Explored 5 deep learning architectures (LSTM, TCN, TFT, N-HiTS, TiDE) to develop multi-horizon forecasting models for indoor temperature and humidity.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed an edge-centric solution as an alternative to cloud-centric approaches for intelligent building indoor climate modeling and control.
- Conducted a case study in a historic building to assess different deep learning architectures for indoor climate forecasting.
- Found that the TiDE architecture demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-horizon forecasting of temperature and humidity with low computational costs.
- The solution enhances facilities managers' understanding of indoor climate to enable proactive maintenance and precise indoor climate control.
- The edge-based digital twin and deep learning approach is adaptable to other domains like manufacturing.

In summary, this paper presents an edge-centric solution combining digital twins and deep learning that provides predictive insights into building indoor climate to improve human comfort and enable better system control. The case study provides valuable findings on effective deep learning architectures for indoor climate forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.
