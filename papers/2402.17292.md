# [DivAvatar: Diverse 3D Avatar Generation with a Single Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-to-avatar generation methods have limited diversity, producing avatars with only subtle differences in appearance for a given text prompt. This falls short in capturing the full spectrum of human identities and presents challenges for creating realistic diversity in virtual environments.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DivAvatar, a novel framework to generate diverse 3D avatars from a single text prompt. Key ideas:

1) Finetune a 3D generative model (EVA3D) instead of scene-specific models like NeRF to allow efficient diverse generation via noise sampling during inference.

2) A strategic noise sampling technique during training that resurrects the GAN's capability for diverse generation despite the mode-seeking nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. Fix noise in most iterations.

3) A semantic-aware zoom mechanism for separate fine-tuning of body parts to improve textual fidelity of generated textures.

4) A novel feature-based depth loss to smooth geometry by minimizing differences between predicted and ground truth depth maps in VGG feature space.

Main Contributions:

1) A pipeline to rapidly create diverse, quality 3D avatars in various poses from a single text prompt.

2) A strategic noise sampling method to enable the generative model to produce varied avatars aligned to the text input during inference. 

3) Semantic-aware zoom and novel depth loss to enhance textual fidelity of textures and geometry quality respectively.

The method is shown to generate avatars with more significant diversity compared to existing works, while maintaining alignment with the input text prompt. Limitations include lack of photorealism and diversity for certain uniform types.
