# [Towards Robust Prompts on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08479)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we design prompting approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) that robustly generalize to distribution shift and novel classes outside the support set?In particular, the authors aim to study and compare the robustness of in-context learning (IcoL) and prompt learning (ProL) approaches on VLMs. They hypothesize that ProL will perform more robustly on test images from base classes (seen in the support set), while IcoL will generalize better to novel unseen classes. To address the limitations of both approaches, they propose a robust prompt learning method by integrating multi-scale image features.The key hypotheses tested in this work are:- ProL will be more robust on base classes compared to IcoL. - IcoL will generalize better to novel classes compared to ProL.- Integrating multi-scale image features into prompt learning will improve robustness on both base and novel classes.So in summary, the central research question is how to design robust prompting approaches for VLMs, with a focus on studying and comparing IcoL vs ProL, and proposing a robust ProL method to improve generalization. The key hypotheses aim to test the robustness of IcoL and ProL on base vs novel classes, and whether multi-scale features can improve robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a robust prompt learning approach for vision-language models (VLMs) that integrates multi-scale image features into the prompt. Specifically:- The paper first defines and studies two types of robustness for VLMs on image classification: robustness on base classes (seen during prompt learning) and robustness on novel classes (unseen during prompt learning). - Through experiments, it reveals that existing prompt learning methods offer better robustness on base classes but generalize worse to novel classes compared to in-context learning. - Motivated by robust multi-scale network architectures, the paper proposes a robust prompt learning method that integrates multi-scale visual features of an image into the prompt. - Extensive experiments show the proposed robust prompt learning significantly improves robustness on both base and novel classes compared to existing in-context and prompt learning approaches.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and empirically demonstrating a robust prompt learning approach for VLMs that leverages multi-scale visual features to achieve improved robustness on both base and novel classes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes robust prompt learning for visual-language models by integrating multi-scale image features into the prompt, which improves robustness to distribution shifts for both base classes seen during training and novel classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of robustness of vision-language models:- This is one of the first studies to systematically analyze and compare the robustness of in-context learning (IcoL) vs prompt learning (ProL) approaches on vision-language models. Most prior work has focused on studying these methods independently. - The paper introduces formal definitions and evaluations for two types of robustness - robustness on base classes and robustness on novel classes. This provides a rigorous framework for analyzing model robustness.- The empirical study reveals some interesting and previously unknown findings - that ProL tends to be more robust on base classes while IcoL generalizes better to novel classes. This sheds new light on the tradeoffs between the two methods.- The proposed robust ProL method integrates multi-scale image features into the prompt, inspired by robust network architectures. The strong gains show this is an effective technique for improving robustness that has not been explored before for prompting vision-language models.- The comparisons to supervised learning baselines provide useful context, revealing that robust ProL can match or exceed the robustness of models trained on more data. - The analysis goes beyond just proposing a new method - there are extensive ablations and experiments that provide insights into why and how robust ProL works.Overall, this is a comprehensive study that advances our understanding of an important problem - robustness of in-context learning methods on vision-language models. The formal analysis framework, empirical findings, and proposed techniques significantly build on prior work in this emerging field.
