# [RISE: Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation of Black-box Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we generate explanations for the predictions of black-box deep neural network image classifiers without needing access to the internal parameters or gradients of the model? The key hypothesis is that it is possible to estimate the importance of each input pixel to a model's prediction by randomly masking the input image in different combinations and observing the effect on the model output. By averaging many random masks weighted by the model's outputs, an approximation of each pixel's importance can be obtained without any knowledge of the model internals.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a method called RISE that can generate saliency maps explaining image classification decisions of black-box neural networks by probing them with random masks on the input images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing RISE, a novel approach for explaining predictions of black-box deep neural network models on image data. The key ideas are:- RISE generates a saliency map indicating the importance of each input pixel to the model's prediction by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image. - It treats the model as a complete black box, without needing access to internal parameters, gradients, or features. This makes it applicable to arbitrary network architectures.- It introduces causal metrics like deletion and insertion for evaluating explanation methods without human involvement. These aim to assess how well the saliency map captures the true evidence behind the model's decisions.- Experiments show RISE matches or exceeds both white-box and black-box state-of-the-art explanation methods in terms of the proposed automatic evaluation metrics as well as human-centered metrics.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel black-box explanation approach that generates importance maps by sampling random masks of the input, and evaluating it with causal metrics that do not require human annotation. The approach is model-agnostic and performs competitively compared to methods that access internal model information.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on explainable AI for deep neural networks:- This paper proposes a method called RISE that can generate saliency maps explaining the predictions of black-box neural network models. In contrast, most prior work like Grad-CAM requires access to the model's internal representations/gradients and is considered "white-box" explanation. RISE is more general since it treats the model as a black box.- RISE estimates the importance of each input pixel by randomly masking the input and seeing how the predictions change. This is a simple but effective approach not explored deeply in prior work. Most existing methods compute importance based on gradients or activations.- The paper proposes automatic causal metrics like deletion and insertion for evaluating explanations, without human annotation. Many prior works evaluated explanations based on human-judged importance or bounding boxes, which is more subjective. The deletion/insertion metrics aim to directly test if the explanation captures the true "cause" of the model's predictions.- Experiments show RISE matches or exceeds both white-box and black-box explanation methods on standard datasets like ImageNet and PASCAL VOC in terms of the proposed causal metrics as well as human-centric pointing accuracy. This demonstrates the viability of the approach.- RISE is also shown to be easily applicable to explaining image captioning models, while most prior work focused only on classifiers. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.Overall, this paper makes valuable contributions in developing a general black-box explanation method and proposing more rigorous automatic evaluation metrics. The simple yet effective randomized masking approach and strong results support RISE as a viable new direction for explainable AI research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploiting the generality of the RISE approach for explaining decisions made by complex networks in other domains like video. The authors state this directly in the conclusion.- Intelligently sampling fewer random masks to reduce the computational cost of RISE while maintaining performance. The authors mention this could help address the heavy computation requirements of RISE.- Improving the noise in the importance maps generated by RISE, especially for objects of varying sizes. The authors note in the results that sampling approximation can sometimes lead to noisy importance maps.- Evaluating explanations on additional datasets with more diversity. The authors used ImageNet, PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets which contain natural images. Testing on datasets from other domains could further demonstrate the generality. - Comparative testing with more white-box and black-box explanation methods as new techniques are developed. The authors already compared with several state-of-the-art methods.- Human evaluation of the explanations produced by RISE to complement the automatic causal metrics proposed. The authors use pointing game accuracy as one form of human evaluation but suggest developing more human-centric metrics.In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding RISE's applicability, reducing its computational requirements, improving the visual quality of explanations, and performing more extensive comparative testing and evaluation. The authors propose RISE as a general black-box explanation approach and suggest multiple avenues for building on it.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes RISE, a method for explaining the predictions of black-box neural network models that take images as input. RISE works by generating an importance map that shows how salient each pixel in the input image is for the model's prediction. It does this by probing the black-box model with many randomly masked versions of the input image, recording the model's outputs, and taking a weighted average of the masks where the weights come from the corresponding outputs. This allows RISE to estimate pixel importance without needing access to internal model details like gradients or activations. The paper introduces two automatic metrics for evaluating explanations - deletion and insertion - which measure how removing or adding pixels impacts the model's predictions based on the saliency map. Experiments on image classification show RISE matches or exceeds other methods, including white-box approaches that require model access, in terms of the automatic metrics and a human-based pointing game metric. A key advantage of RISE is its general applicability to any black-box model.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes RISE, a new approach for explaining decisions made by black-box deep neural network models on image classification tasks. RISE works by generating an importance map that shows how salient each pixel in the input image is towards the model's prediction. It does this by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image and recording the change in predicted probability. The final saliency map is a weighted combination of the random masks, where the weights come from the predicted probabilities on the masked inputs. The key advantage of RISE is that it treats the model as a complete black box, only requiring access to the input and output. Thus it can explain models of any architecture without needing access to internal states. The paper evaluates RISE against other explanation methods like GradCAM and LIME on datasets like ImageNet, PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO using automated causal metrics and human-centered evaluations. The causal metrics measure how model predictions change when pixels are removed or inserted according to the saliency map. RISE is shown to match or exceed other methods, including white-box approaches, on these metrics and also has competitive performance on the human-centered pointing game metric. The results demonstrate that RISE can generate faithful explanations for arbitrary black-box models in a model-agnostic way.
