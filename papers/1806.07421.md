# [RISE: Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation of Black-box Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we generate explanations for the predictions of black-box deep neural network image classifiers without needing access to the internal parameters or gradients of the model? 

The key hypothesis is that it is possible to estimate the importance of each input pixel to a model's prediction by randomly masking the input image in different combinations and observing the effect on the model output. By averaging many random masks weighted by the model's outputs, an approximation of each pixel's importance can be obtained without any knowledge of the model internals.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a method called RISE that can generate saliency maps explaining image classification decisions of black-box neural networks by probing them with random masks on the input images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing RISE, a novel approach for explaining predictions of black-box deep neural network models on image data. 

The key ideas are:

- RISE generates a saliency map indicating the importance of each input pixel to the model's prediction by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image. 

- It treats the model as a complete black box, without needing access to internal parameters, gradients, or features. This makes it applicable to arbitrary network architectures.

- It introduces causal metrics like deletion and insertion for evaluating explanation methods without human involvement. These aim to assess how well the saliency map captures the true evidence behind the model's decisions.

- Experiments show RISE matches or exceeds both white-box and black-box state-of-the-art explanation methods in terms of the proposed automatic evaluation metrics as well as human-centered metrics.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel black-box explanation approach that generates importance maps by sampling random masks of the input, and evaluating it with causal metrics that do not require human annotation. The approach is model-agnostic and performs competitively compared to methods that access internal model information.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes RISE, a novel approach to generate saliency maps that explain predictions of black-box image classification models by randomly masking input images and weighing the resulting model outputs to estimate each pixel's importance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on explainable AI for deep neural networks:

- This paper proposes a method called RISE that can generate saliency maps explaining the predictions of black-box neural network models. In contrast, most prior work like Grad-CAM requires access to the model's internal representations/gradients and is considered "white-box" explanation. RISE is more general since it treats the model as a black box.

- RISE estimates the importance of each input pixel by randomly masking the input and seeing how the predictions change. This is a simple but effective approach not explored deeply in prior work. Most existing methods compute importance based on gradients or activations.

- The paper proposes automatic causal metrics like deletion and insertion for evaluating explanations, without human annotation. Many prior works evaluated explanations based on human-judged importance or bounding boxes, which is more subjective. The deletion/insertion metrics aim to directly test if the explanation captures the true "cause" of the model's predictions.

- Experiments show RISE matches or exceeds both white-box and black-box explanation methods on standard datasets like ImageNet and PASCAL VOC in terms of the proposed causal metrics as well as human-centric pointing accuracy. This demonstrates the viability of the approach.

- RISE is also shown to be easily applicable to explaining image captioning models, while most prior work focused only on classifiers. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.

Overall, this paper makes valuable contributions in developing a general black-box explanation method and proposing more rigorous automatic evaluation metrics. The simple yet effective randomized masking approach and strong results support RISE as a viable new direction for explainable AI research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploiting the generality of the RISE approach for explaining decisions made by complex networks in other domains like video. The authors state this directly in the conclusion.

- Intelligently sampling fewer random masks to reduce the computational cost of RISE while maintaining performance. The authors mention this could help address the heavy computation requirements of RISE.

- Improving the noise in the importance maps generated by RISE, especially for objects of varying sizes. The authors note in the results that sampling approximation can sometimes lead to noisy importance maps.

- Evaluating explanations on additional datasets with more diversity. The authors used ImageNet, PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets which contain natural images. Testing on datasets from other domains could further demonstrate the generality. 

- Comparative testing with more white-box and black-box explanation methods as new techniques are developed. The authors already compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

- Human evaluation of the explanations produced by RISE to complement the automatic causal metrics proposed. The authors use pointing game accuracy as one form of human evaluation but suggest developing more human-centric metrics.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding RISE's applicability, reducing its computational requirements, improving the visual quality of explanations, and performing more extensive comparative testing and evaluation. The authors propose RISE as a general black-box explanation approach and suggest multiple avenues for building on it.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes RISE, a method for explaining the predictions of black-box neural network models that take images as input. RISE works by generating an importance map that shows how salient each pixel in the input image is for the model's prediction. It does this by probing the black-box model with many randomly masked versions of the input image, recording the model's outputs, and taking a weighted average of the masks where the weights come from the corresponding outputs. This allows RISE to estimate pixel importance without needing access to internal model details like gradients or activations. The paper introduces two automatic metrics for evaluating explanations - deletion and insertion - which measure how removing or adding pixels impacts the model's predictions based on the saliency map. Experiments on image classification show RISE matches or exceeds other methods, including white-box approaches that require model access, in terms of the automatic metrics and a human-based pointing game metric. A key advantage of RISE is its general applicability to any black-box model.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes RISE, a new approach for explaining decisions made by black-box deep neural network models on image classification tasks. RISE works by generating an importance map that shows how salient each pixel in the input image is towards the model's prediction. It does this by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image and recording the change in predicted probability. The final saliency map is a weighted combination of the random masks, where the weights come from the predicted probabilities on the masked inputs. The key advantage of RISE is that it treats the model as a complete black box, only requiring access to the input and output. Thus it can explain models of any architecture without needing access to internal states. 

The paper evaluates RISE against other explanation methods like GradCAM and LIME on datasets like ImageNet, PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO using automated causal metrics and human-centered evaluations. The causal metrics measure how model predictions change when pixels are removed or inserted according to the saliency map. RISE is shown to match or exceed other methods, including white-box approaches, on these metrics and also has competitive performance on the human-centered pointing game metric. The results demonstrate that RISE can generate faithful explanations for arbitrary black-box models in a model-agnostic way.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method presented in this paper is Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE). The key idea is to probe a black-box neural network model by randomly masking the input image multiple times and recording the model's predictions on each masked image. The final saliency map is generated as a linear combination of the random binary masks, where the weights come from the predicted scores on the corresponding masked images. Specifically, the saliency value for each pixel is computed as the expected model score conditioned on that pixel being unmasked, which can be estimated empirically using Monte Carlo sampling with random masks. This allows generating an importance map that indicates how salient each pixel is for the model's prediction, without needing access to the model's internal weights or gradients. The general framework of randomly probing the black-box model is simple yet powerful for explaining predictions of neural networks with any architecture.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of explainable AI, specifically for explaining the decisions made by deep neural networks that take images as input and output a classification. The key question is how to generate "importance maps" that indicate how salient each pixel in the input image is for the network's prediction, especially for black-box models where internal details like gradients are not accessible.

Some key points:

- Explainable AI is important for understanding and building trust in AI systems, especially those making high-stakes decisions like medical diagnosis. 

- Existing methods to generate importance maps require access to internal model details like gradients, activations, or weights. This limits their applicability.

- The paper proposes RISE, a method to generate importance maps by probing black-box models with randomly masked input images and aggregating the results.

- RISE treats the model as a complete black box, only requiring input and output access. This makes it widely applicable.

- The paper introduces causal metrics like deletion and insertion for evaluating explanations without human involvement.

- Experiments across datasets and models show RISE matches or exceeds both white-box and black-box methods in importance map quality and causal metrics.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of explainable AI by proposing a novel black-box method to generate importance maps that relies only on probing the input-output behavior. The method is evaluated thoroughly and shown to be effective.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes RISE, a method for explaining the predictions of black-box image classification models by estimating the importance of each input pixel. RISE works by generating many random binary masks, multiplying them with the input image, feeding the masked images into the black-box model, and recording the model's outputs. The final saliency map is computed as a weighted linear combination of the random masks, where the weights come from the model's outputs on the corresponding masked inputs. Unlike other methods, RISE treats the model as a total black box and only relies on its input-output behavior. The paper introduces two automatic evaluation metrics called deletion and insertion to quantitatively measure the causal relationship between input pixels and model predictions, without human involvement. Experiments on several datasets and models show RISE generates high quality explanations competitive with white-box approaches. A key advantage is that RISE can explain any model without knowing its internals.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the RISE method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the importance map in Equation 4. How is the number of random masks N determined? Is there a trade-off between computation time and accuracy as N increases?

2. For mask generation, what motivated the use of bilinear upsampling followed by random cropping versus simply generating masks at the full image resolution? How does this impact the diversity and information content of the masked images?

5. For the pointing game metric, is the requirement that the highest saliency point falls in the ground truth bounding box too restrictive? Could a soft metric based on overlap be more robust?

6. The paper shows RISE generating explanations for image captions. Could the approach extend to other modalities like video, audio, or text? What modifications would be needed?

7. RISE probes the model with randomly masked images. Could adversarial masking provide more informative samples? How would you generate adversarial masks efficiently?

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes RISE, a method for explaining the predictions of black-box deep neural network image classifiers by generating a saliency map indicating the importance of each pixel to the model's output. RISE works by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image and computing the saliency map as a weighted linear combination of the masks, where the weights come from the predicted class probabilities on the masked inputs. A key advantage of RISE is that it treats the model as a black box, only requiring the input and output, making it much more generalizable than white-box methods that rely on internal model details. The paper introduces two new automatic evaluation metrics for saliency maps based on gradually deleting or inserting pixels according to the map and measuring the classification probability, arguing these avoid human subjectivity and better assess causality. Experiments across image datasets and network architectures show RISE matches or exceeds both white-box and black-box methods on the automatic metrics and standard pointing game metric. The approach is also demonstrated to extend naturally to explaining image captioning models. Overall, RISE provides a novel way to generate visually interpretable explanations from arbitrary deep network models.
