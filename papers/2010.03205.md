# Like hiking? You probably enjoy nature: Persona-grounded Dialog with   Commonsense Expansions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that expanding available persona sentences with commonsense implications using existing knowledge bases or paraphrasing resources and incorporating this expanded persona information through fine-grained persona grounding will lead to:1) More persona-consistent and contextually relevant dialog responses.2) More interesting, engaging, and diverse responses. 3) More interpretable and controllable persona-grounded dialog models.Specifically, the paper proposes to expand limited persona descriptions using commonsense knowledge from COMET and paraphrasing techniques. It then introduces a model called COMPAC that incorporates these expansions through explicit fine-grained persona grounding modeled via a discrete latent variable. This allows conditioning response generation on the most relevant persona fact. The paper presents experiments analyzing dialog quality, persona grounding, and controllability which provide evidence for the above hypotheses.In summary, the key hypothesis is that commonsense persona expansions + fine-grained grounding will enable more consistent, engaging, and controllable persona-based conversation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Using COMET, a pretrained Transformer model, to generate commonsense-driven expansions of persona sentences instead of having the dialog model learn these implied facts from scratch.2. Developing a discrete latent variable dialog model that is capable of selecting the most relevant persona facts from the original and expanded personas without supervision. This leads to greater interpretability of which persona facts are being used. 3. Showing that their model is useful for controllable generation - it can effectively adapt responses based on modifications to the input persona facts.4. Demonstrating improved dialog quality both automatically (lower perplexity, higher diversity metrics) and via human evaluation (more engaging and coherent responses). In summary, the key ideas are using commonsense knowledge bases to expand limited persona facts, modeling the persona choice via a discrete latent variable for interpretability and control, and showing these ideas improve persona-grounded dialog quality. The commonsense expansions allow the model to have a richer understanding of the persona for more consistent and engaging dialog.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes expanding persona sentences in persona-grounded dialog with commonsense knowledge using COMET and paraphrasing, and shows this improves dialog quality and diversity while a proposed model with fine-grained persona selection enables accurate and controllable generation.
