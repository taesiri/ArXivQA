# [Like hiking? You probably enjoy nature: Persona-grounded Dialog with   Commonsense Expansions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03205)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that expanding available persona sentences with commonsense implications using existing knowledge bases or paraphrasing resources and incorporating this expanded persona information through fine-grained persona grounding will lead to:

1) More persona-consistent and contextually relevant dialog responses.

2) More interesting, engaging, and diverse responses. 

3) More interpretable and controllable persona-grounded dialog models.

Specifically, the paper proposes to expand limited persona descriptions using commonsense knowledge from COMET and paraphrasing techniques. It then introduces a model called COMPAC that incorporates these expansions through explicit fine-grained persona grounding modeled via a discrete latent variable. This allows conditioning response generation on the most relevant persona fact. The paper presents experiments analyzing dialog quality, persona grounding, and controllability which provide evidence for the above hypotheses.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that commonsense persona expansions + fine-grained grounding will enable more consistent, engaging, and controllable persona-based conversation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Using COMET, a pretrained Transformer model, to generate commonsense-driven expansions of persona sentences instead of having the dialog model learn these implied facts from scratch.

2. Developing a discrete latent variable dialog model that is capable of selecting the most relevant persona facts from the original and expanded personas without supervision. This leads to greater interpretability of which persona facts are being used. 

3. Showing that their model is useful for controllable generation - it can effectively adapt responses based on modifications to the input persona facts.

4. Demonstrating improved dialog quality both automatically (lower perplexity, higher diversity metrics) and via human evaluation (more engaging and coherent responses). 

In summary, the key ideas are using commonsense knowledge bases to expand limited persona facts, modeling the persona choice via a discrete latent variable for interpretability and control, and showing these ideas improve persona-grounded dialog quality. The commonsense expansions allow the model to have a richer understanding of the persona for more consistent and engaging dialog.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes expanding persona sentences in persona-grounded dialog with commonsense knowledge using COMET and paraphrasing, and shows this improves dialog quality and diversity while a proposed model with fine-grained persona selection enables accurate and controllable generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on persona-grounded dialog compares to other related work:

- It focuses on expanding persona sentences with commonsense knowledge to make the dialog model more consistent. Many prior works have focused just on the core persona-grounded dialog task itself. 

- It uses the COMET framework to automatically generate commonsense expansions of persona sentences, rather than requiring manual expansions or the model learning expansions from scratch.

- It incorporates fine-grained persona grounding by modeling the choice over expanded personas as a latent variable. This provides more flexibility and interpretability than prior models that encode the full persona context together.

- The proposed CompAC model outperforms competitive baselines on the PersonaChat dataset in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluations. This demonstrates the benefits of the commonsense expansions and fine-grained grounding.

- The paper shows CompAC can generate responses more consistently grounded in the personas, and also support controlled generation by modifying the persona sentences. This controllability is a useful property lacked by most existing persona dialog models.

Overall, this paper pushes forward persona-grounded dialog by integrating external commonsense knowledge and increasing model interpretability and controllability. The proposed techniques help overcome some key challenges faced by prior persona dialog models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different methods for expanding persona sentences beyond COMET and paraphrasing systems. The authors note that their expansions are limited by the capabilities of COMET and paraphrasing systems. They suggest exploring end-to-end training of the dialog model along with the expansion generation as a possibility.

- Extending the prior network to sample multiple persona sentences instead of just one. The authors' current model samples a single persona sentence to condition the response on. They suggest expanding the sampling space to allow selecting multiple persona sentences, which could potentially generate more interesting responses.

- Applying the persona expansion and fine-grained grounding framework to other dialog tasks and datasets beyond PersonaChat. The authors developed their model on the PersonaChat dataset, but the overall approach could be applied to other dialog domains.

- Incorporating additional commonsense knowledge beyond the relations used from ATOMIC. The COMET expansions rely on the schema from ATOMIC, but other commonsense knowledge bases could provide additional expansion possibilities.

- Studying the effect of fine-grained persona grounding in retrieval-based dialog systems. The current work focuses on generative dialog models. Applying a similar grounding approach in retrieval could be promising.

- Analyzing different decoding methods and objectives for improving diversity. The authors experiment with some decoding techniques but suggest further exploration of decoding schemes and sequence-level training objectives.

So in summary, the main future directions are expanding the persona sentences in different ways, incorporating additional knowledge sources, applying the approach to other datasets/tasks, and analysis around decoding methods and diversity. Overall the authors propose several interesting ways to build on their persona grounding framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to expand persona sentences in persona-grounded dialog with commonsense implications using an existing commonsense knowledge base (COMET) and paraphrasing. The expanded personas provide richer context to make the dialog model more consistent. The paper also proposes a model called COMPAC which makes a discrete choice over the expanded persona sentences based on dialog history as a latent variable to achieve fine-grained persona grounding. This allows selecting the most appropriate persona sentence for generation. Since there can be hundreds of expansions, the model is trained by optimizing a variational lower bound using an inference network. Experiments on the PersonaChat dataset show COMPAC generates more engaging responses compared to baselines as per human evaluation. It also exhibits accurate persona grounding and the capability for controlled generation by modifying the persona. Overall, the paper demonstrates that expanding personas with commonsense and fine-grained grounding helps achieve better persona-consistent dialog.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 The paper presents a method for persona-grounded dialog generation using commonsense knowledge and fine-grained persona grounding. The key points are:

1) The paper expands the given persona sentences for a dialog agent with commonsense implications using the COMET framework or paraphrasing. This provides the model with richer contextual knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated in the personas. 

2) The paper proposes COMPAC, a model which chooses a single relevant persona sentence to condition on for each dialog response via a latent discrete variable. This allows fine-grained persona grounding. The model is trained using amortized variational inference to accommodate a large set of persona expansions. 

In experiments, COMPAC outperforms competitive baselines on the PersonaChat dataset in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluations. It shows improved dialog quality, diversity, coherence with personas, and controllable generation. The commonsense expansions, especially from COMET, are found to provide contextual knowledge that improves consistency and engagement. The fine-grained persona grounding helps effectively utilize the expanded knowledge.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method for persona-grounded dialog generation using commonsense expansions of the persona sentences. The key aspects are:

1. The persona sentences are expanded using COMET, a pretrained model that generates commonsense implications, to create a richer grounding context. This allows the model to respond based on implicit commonsense instead of just the original persona sentences.

2. A discrete latent variable is used to model the choice of which persona sentence/expansion to use for generating each response. This allows fine-grained conditioning on the contextually relevant parts of the expanded persona. 

3. Variational inference with an inference network is used to approximate the posterior over the discrete latent variable during training. This provides a useful inductive bias and avoids prohibitively slow marginalization over all expansions.

4. The expanded persona grounds the response generation by prepending the selected sentence to the dialog history and passing it through a GPT-2 based generator network.

Overall, commonsense expansion of the personas along with modeling discrete choices over them enables the model to have more engaging and contextually-consistent conversations grounded in the given persona descriptions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of getting persona-grounded dialog models to respond appropriately to contexts that are implied by a persona but not explicitly stated. The authors observe that current state-of-the-art models struggle to generate good responses when the dialog context relates indirectly to the given persona sentences. Their proposed approach is to expand the persona sentences with commonsense knowledge to help the model make these implied connections.

Specifically, the paper focuses on two main questions:

1. Can expanding persona sentences with commonsense implications help dialog models generate higher quality and more diverse responses? 

2. Can providing the model with a large set of expanded persona sentences enable more accurate and interpretable persona grounding during dialog?

To address these questions, the authors present a framework to expand persona sentences using either a commonsense knowledge base (COMET) or paraphrasing. They also propose a model architecture called COMPAC that allows fine-grained selection over the expanded persona sentences via a discrete latent variable. Experiments demonstrate improved dialog quality and diversity with the expanded persona, and more accurate grounding compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper aims to improve persona-grounded dialog by equipping models with the ability to make commonsense inferences from limited persona descriptions, through both data augmentation and an interpretable model architecture. The core problems are generating responses consistent with implied dialog context, and achieving accurate persona grounding during dialog.
