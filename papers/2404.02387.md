# [An inversion problem for optical spectrum data via physics-guided   machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02387)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deriving the pairing glue function from measured optical spectra is a challenging inverse problem. It involves solving an ill-posed Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. 
- Conventional methods like SVD, least squares, MEM struggle with noise robustness and flexibility.
- Recent ML methods treat it as blackbox and lack reliability, explainability.

Proposed Solution: 
- Authors propose a novel method called regularized Recurrent Inference Machine (rRIM) which incorporates physics into the learning process.
- rRIM leverages the noisy forward model throughout training and inference to guide the process.
- It is shown to be mathematically equivalent to iterative Tikhonov regularization.  
- This makes the model interpretable and the outputs reliable.

Main Contributions:
- Superior performance over ML baselines with orders of magnitude less training data across noise levels.
- Flexibility in handling out-of-distribution data unlike ML baselines.
- Comparable performance to widely used MEM on real experimental optical spectra data.
- Established connection of method to iterative Tikhonov regularization lending reliability.
- Overall, a physics-incorporated machine learning solution that combines strengths of both physics-based and data-driven approaches for solving challenging inverse problems.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hybrid physics-ML method called rRIM for robustly and reliably solving ill-posed inverse problems using significantly less data than pure data-driven approaches.
