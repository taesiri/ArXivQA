# [Efficient Model Personalization in Federated Learning via   Client-Specific Prompt Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15367)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is how to achieve efficient model personalization for clients with heterogeneous data distributions in federated learning. Specifically, the paper aims to address two main challenges:1) How to leverage powerful pre-trained models like Vision Transformer (ViT) to derive robust features for heterogeneous data, while avoiding the high communication and computation costs of transporting and fine-tuning the entire large model in federated learning. 2) How to enable model personalization for clients with heterogeneous data distributions (e.g. due to domain shifts or class imbalance), instead of using a globally shared model which may not fit each local distribution well.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning method called pFedPG that alternates between "personalized prompt adaptation" on clients and "personalized prompt generation" on the server. The key ideas are:- Clients optimize small prompt vectors to adapt a frozen ViT backbone to their local data, avoiding expensive fine-tuning. - The server learns a prompt generator that produces personalized prompts for each client by exploiting their underlying optimization directions, enabling adaptation to heterogeneous data.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by alternating personalized prompt optimization on clients and prompt generation on the server, pFedPG can achieve both efficient training and model personalization for heterogeneous federated learning. Experiments on vision datasets demonstrate pFedPG's superior accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning framework called pFedPG (client-specific Prompt Generation) for efficient model personalization among heterogeneous clients. The main contributions are:- It proposes a new personalized federated learning approach that alternates between personalized prompt generation at the server and prompt adaptation at clients. - It designs a cross-attention based prompt generator at the server to produce client-specific prompts by implicitly observing optimization directions from local training.- The client-specific prompts allow efficient adaptation of a frozen foundation model like ViT to each client's data distribution. - Experiments on benchmark datasets with domain shifts or label imbalance show pFedPG achieves better performance and efficiency than prior personalized FL methods.In summary, the key innovation is the idea of learning to generate personalized prompts for clients to enable efficient adaptation of large foundation models in federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions. The alternating training and implicit observation of local optimization directions allows prompt personalization without exposing private data.
