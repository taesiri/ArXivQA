# [Entity or Relation Embeddings? An Analysis of Encoding Strategies for   Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Relation extraction aims to identify relationships expressed between entities in text. It is an important task for building knowledge graphs automatically.
- Existing approaches fine-tune language models (LMs) to learn relation embeddings by concatenating contextualized representations of special tokens marking the head and tail entities. However, this strategy focuses more on modeling entity types rather than relations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper hypothesizes that learning relations directly using a prompt with a [MASK] token leads to complementary information to entity-based embeddings. 
- It proposes a hybrid model that jointly trains the LM to predict relations using both the head/tail entity embeddings and the [MASK] embedding from a prompting strategy.

Key Contributions:
- Shows that a [MASK]-based prompting strategy alone performs poorly for relation extraction but captures complementary information to head/tail entity embeddings.
- The proposed hybrid model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several relation extraction benchmarks including TACRED, TACREV, Re-TACRED, Wiki-WD and NYT-FB.
- Demonstrates that off-the-shelf entity embeddings can be as effective as fine-tuned entity embeddings, further validating that entity embeddings primarily capture type information.
- Introduces a self-supervised pre-training approach for relations based on coreference chains in text which brings significant improvements.

In summary, the key insight is that directly modeling relations and entities provide complementary information. By combining both strategies, the paper presents a simple but effective approach advancing state-of-the-art relation extraction.
