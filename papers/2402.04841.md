# [Data-efficient Large Vision Models through Sequential Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Current large vision models (LVMs) rely on massive datasets (hundreds of billions of tokens) and colossal models (billions of parameters), limiting accessibility. 
- Training LVMs on imbalanced multi-task datasets leads to biased performance towards majority tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Use simple data augmentation techniques to balance the distribution of data across tasks, especially for minority tasks. This is shown to boost performance.
- Apply knowledge distillation (KD) to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher LVM to a smaller student LVM. This narrows the performance gap substantially.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate data augmentation is effective for balancing multi-task LVM training, outperforming re-sampling baselines.
- Show KD successfully compresses LVMs to 80M parameters with no loss in visual quality or task performance. 
- The techniques allow training data-efficient LVMs using 8x fewer GPUs and 4x less time while retaining capabilities across image segmentation, human pose estimation and image deraining.
- Analysis provides directions to make LVMs more accessible without requiring massive datasets or models, advancing general visual intelligence.

In summary, the paper puts forth data augmentation and KD strategies to develop efficient LVMs using significantly fewer computational resources and data compared to state-of-the-art methods. The techniques open avenues for more practical autoregressive vision models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores developing more efficient autoregressive vision models by using data augmentation and knowledge distillation, enabling large vision models with fewer parameters and less training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is exploring strategies to develop more efficient autoregressive large vision models (LVMs) that require less data and compute resources while still achieving strong performance across different vision tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) A simple data augmentation strategy to handle long-tail distributed data across vision tasks. This helps balance the data and improve overall model performance.

2) The use of knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher LVM to a smaller student LVM. This narrows the performance gap and allows more compact yet accurate models to be trained. 

3) Empirical evaluations demonstrating these strategies enable LVMs to attain proficiency on diverse visual tasks while significantly reducing the number of parameters and training data requirements. For example, their distilled 80M parameter LVM achieves promising results on image segmentation, pose estimation and deraining.

In summary, the core contribution is advancing the development of more practical and accessible autoregressive LVMs by enhancing data efficiency and model compression to alleviate over-reliance on enormous datasets and models.
