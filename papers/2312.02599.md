# [MAINS: A Magnetic Field Aided Inertial Navigation System for Indoor   Positioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02599)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a Magnetic field Aided Inertial Navigation System (MAINS) for indoor positioning. MAINS leverages an array of magnetometers to measure spatial variations in the magnetic field, which are then used to estimate the displacement and orientation changes of the system to aid an inertial navigation system (INS). A polynomial magnetic field model is incorporated into the state-space model of an error-state Kalman filter to realize the tightly integrated system. Experiments demonstrate that MAINS significantly outperforms a stand-alone INS, with a remarkable two orders of magnitude reduction in position error growth rate. Compared to the state-of-the-art magnetic-field-aided navigation approach in [23], MAINS exhibits slightly improved horizontal position accuracy but noticeably larger vertical error on datasets with significant magnetic field variations. However, a key advantage of MAINS is the flexibility to use different magnetometer array configurations - using an array of 30 magnetometers, the position error after 2 minutes of navigation is less than 3 meters in most test cases. This slower error growth rate has the potential to greatly extend the allowable length of exploration phases in magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. Overall, MAINS shows promise for real-world application of magnetic-field-based indoor positioning.
