# [Less is More: One-shot Subgraph Reasoning on Large-scale Knowledge   Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing knowledge graph (KG) link prediction methods suffer from severe scalability issues when applied to large-scale KGs. Structural models rely on propagation over the entire graph, scoring all entities as potential answers, which is highly inefficient. This hinders optimization and application of these models on large KGs. The paper raises an open question - can we conduct efficient and effective link prediction on large KGs?

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new prediction framework called "one-shot-subgraph" link prediction. Instead of acting on the full KG, prediction is decoupled into (1) extracting a single, query-dependent subgraph using a sampler, and (2) predicting on this subgraph using a predictor. This allows avoiding propagation on the full KG. The sampler uses personalized PageRank to efficiently identify relevant entities and relations. The predictor can be an expressive GNN model.

Main Contributions:
1) Formalizes the idea of decoupled, one-shot subgraph prediction on KGs and shows its benefits in complexity.
2) Realizes this with an efficient PPR sampler and expressive GNN predictor. Demonstrates the critical role of joint optimization of sampler and predictor. 
3) Shows only a fraction of entities (10%) are needed for answering queries, identifiable by PPR without learning. This contradicts the notion that full KGs are necessary.
4) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple large KG benchmarks, with over 90% efficiency gains.

In summary, the paper makes a valuable conceptual contribution regarding prediction on KGs, with strong technical and empirical evidence. The notion of sampling query-specific subgraphs can influence future KG methods.
