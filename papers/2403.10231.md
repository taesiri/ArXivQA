# [Less is More: One-shot Subgraph Reasoning on Large-scale Knowledge   Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing knowledge graph (KG) link prediction methods suffer from severe scalability issues when applied to large-scale KGs. Structural models rely on propagation over the entire graph, scoring all entities as potential answers, which is highly inefficient. This hinders optimization and application of these models on large KGs. The paper raises an open question - can we conduct efficient and effective link prediction on large KGs?

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new prediction framework called "one-shot-subgraph" link prediction. Instead of acting on the full KG, prediction is decoupled into (1) extracting a single, query-dependent subgraph using a sampler, and (2) predicting on this subgraph using a predictor. This allows avoiding propagation on the full KG. The sampler uses personalized PageRank to efficiently identify relevant entities and relations. The predictor can be an expressive GNN model.

Main Contributions:
1) Formalizes the idea of decoupled, one-shot subgraph prediction on KGs and shows its benefits in complexity.
2) Realizes this with an efficient PPR sampler and expressive GNN predictor. Demonstrates the critical role of joint optimization of sampler and predictor. 
3) Shows only a fraction of entities (10%) are needed for answering queries, identifiable by PPR without learning. This contradicts the notion that full KGs are necessary.
4) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple large KG benchmarks, with over 90% efficiency gains.

In summary, the paper makes a valuable conceptual contribution regarding prediction on KGs, with strong technical and empirical evidence. The notion of sampling query-specific subgraphs can influence future KG methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel one-shot-subgraph link prediction framework for knowledge graphs that achieves efficient and adaptive prediction by extracting only a small, query-dependent subgraph using heuristics and then predicting on that subgraph.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Conceptually formalizing a new manner of "one-shot-subgraph link prediction" on knowledge graphs to achieve efficient and adaptive prediction by decoupling the prediction procedure into subgraph sampling and prediction on the extracted subgraph.

2. Technically instantiating this idea with efficient non-parametric Personalized PageRank sampler and powerful knowledge graph predictors like DRUM, NBFNet, RED-GNN. 

3. Setting up and solving a non-trivial bi-level optimization problem to automatically search for optimal configurations in both data space (sampling ratios) and model space (predictor designs) for adapting to a specific knowledge graph.

4. Empirically showing state-of-the-art performance on five large-scale benchmark datasets, with improved efficiency (94.4% on average) and effectiveness (6.9% promotion on average) of prediction.

5. Discovering that utilizing the whole knowledge graph is unnecessary for prediction and only a small proportion of entities and facts (e.g. 10%) are essential, which can be identified by Personalized PageRank without learning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the one-shot-subgraph prediction manner for efficient and adaptive link prediction on large-scale knowledge graphs, with solid algorithm designs, optimization frameworks, and empirical verification.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- One-shot-subgraph link prediction - The main concept proposed, involving predicting links on knowledge graphs by extracting a single subgraph based on the query.

- Knowledge graphs - Graph-structured data representing facts and relations. Link prediction is conducted on knowledge graphs. 

- Personalized PageRank (PPR) - A non-parametric, efficient heuristic used to generate the sampling distribution and extract the query-dependent subgraph.

- Sampler and predictor - The one-shot framework decouples prediction into a sampler module that extracts the subgraph and a predictor module that makes predictions on the subgraph.

- Optimization - An automated search procedure is introduced to find optimal configurations on both the data side (sampling ratios) and model side (design choices).

- Scalability - A major focus is improving the efficiency and scalability of prediction on large-scale knowledge graphs compared to existing structural models.

- Effectiveness - The method also achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on several benchmarks.

- Subgraph scale - An important finding is that using the whole knowledge graph is unnecessary, and a small, query-relevant subgraph contains the essential information.
