# [ShallowBlocker: Improving Set Similarity Joins for Blocking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15835)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Blocking is a critical step in entity matching to reduce the number of record pairs that need to be compared. However, blocking methods typically require substantial manual tuning and engineering by experts to work well on different datasets. Recent deep learning methods have aimed to solve this by learning representations automatically, but they can be unstable, offer little interpretability, require significant compute resources, and do not necessarily outperform classical methods. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new blocking method called ShallowBlocker that works well across datasets in a hands-off fashion without elaborate tuning. The core of ShallowBlocker is a new hybrid set similarity join routine called TTRKJoin that combines absolute similarity thresholds, relative similarity thresholds, and local cardinality thresholds in a single join. This allows complementary filtering behavior to remove both consistently low similarity pairs and relatively dissimilar pairs. TTRKJoin uses a novel pre-candidate filter called prefix-partitioned suffix filtering to aggressively reduce candidates. The method selects good join parameters in a fully automated way using a proposed strategy of exploiting tradeoffs between the different constraints. Approximate joins can also be performed when needed to improve efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- ShallowBlocker blocking method that achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness across datasets without dataset-specific tuning
- Introduction of a flexible $(\tau, \tau_r, k)$-join primitive combining absolute, relative and local cardinality thresholds  
- Efficient TTRKJoin algorithm for the new join primitive with strong candidate pruning
- Framework for quickly estimating effect of TTRKJoin hyperparameters  
- Approximate join techniques with quality guarantees to improve efficiency
- Comprehensive experiments showing ShallowBlocker outperforming other state-of-the-art blocking methods, including deep learning techniques, while being more efficient and interpretable
