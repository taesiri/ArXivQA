# [Be-Your-Outpainter: Mastering Video Outpainting through Input-Specific   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video outpainting aims to expand the spatial boundaries of input videos to fit different aspect ratios while maintaining temporal and spatial consistency. Existing methods either rely on complex warping techniques or require training specialized models on large-scale video datasets. However, they have limitations in flexibility, quality and ability to handle out-of-domain videos. 

Proposed Method - MOTIA:
The paper proposes MOTIA (Mastering Video Outpainting Through Input-Specific Adaptation), a diffusion-based pipeline for high-quality and flexible video outpainting. MOTIA has two main phases:

1. Input-specific adaptation: Conducts efficient pseudo outpainting learning on the single-shot source video to capture its intrinsic data-specific patterns and bridge the gap from standard generation. Strategies used include video augmentation, masking, noising and optimizing lightweight adapters.

2. Pattern-aware outpainting: Generalizes the learned patterns for outpainting through proposed strategies:
   - Spatial-aware insertion to balance fine-tuned patterns and generative prior 
   - Noise regret to mitigate denoising conflicts between known and unknown regions

MOTIA can easily extend to long videos by adapting to short clips and using temporal co-denoising.

Main Contributions:

1) Demonstrates the importance of learning input-specific patterns from source video for effective outpainting.

2) Proposes adaption strategy to capture patterns and outpainting strategies to leverage patterns and generative prior.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance in flexibility, quality and handling out-of-domain videos. Significantly outperforms previous methods in standard benchmarks without extensive tuning.
