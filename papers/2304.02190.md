# [Globalizing Fairness Attributes in Machine Learning: A Case Study on   Health in Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02190)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models have potential for impact in global health but could propagate biases and lead to harmful outcomes, especially for vulnerable groups. Most fairness research focuses on high-income countries, not low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like those in Africa.
- There are already inequitable power imbalances in global health between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs. Applying ML models from HICs to LMICs risks perpetuating these imbalances and "algorithmic colonialism". 

Proposed Solution:
- Identify relevant axes of disparities to consider for fair ML in the African context, both between Africa and the West and within Africa.
- Propose continent-level axes like colonial history, national income level, country of origin; and localized axes like race, ethnicity, language, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
- Map these axes to potential biases that could arise in ML pipelines for various health data modalities like medical imaging, surveys, lab tests, genomics, etc.

Main Contributions:
- Defines fairness attributes tailored to ML applications for health in the African context, considering continental and localized disparities. 
- Provides examples of how biases could emerge from these attributes when building ML models using different health data modalities common in Africa.
- Calls for further research into algorithmic fairness and decolonizing ML to prevent harm from emerging applications in global health.
- Lays a foundation for understanding and applying fair ML for health in Africa and similarly underserved regions.

The paper argues ML has potential benefits for global health equity but risks exacerbating existing inequities without proactive consideration of relevant axes of disparities in the African context. It contributes an initial framework for identifying such attributes.
