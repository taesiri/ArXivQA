# [Globalizing Fairness Attributes in Machine Learning: A Case Study on   Health in Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02190)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models have potential for impact in global health but could propagate biases and lead to harmful outcomes, especially for vulnerable groups. Most fairness research focuses on high-income countries, not low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like those in Africa.
- There are already inequitable power imbalances in global health between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs. Applying ML models from HICs to LMICs risks perpetuating these imbalances and "algorithmic colonialism". 

Proposed Solution:
- Identify relevant axes of disparities to consider for fair ML in the African context, both between Africa and the West and within Africa.
- Propose continent-level axes like colonial history, national income level, country of origin; and localized axes like race, ethnicity, language, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
- Map these axes to potential biases that could arise in ML pipelines for various health data modalities like medical imaging, surveys, lab tests, genomics, etc.

Main Contributions:
- Defines fairness attributes tailored to ML applications for health in the African context, considering continental and localized disparities. 
- Provides examples of how biases could emerge from these attributes when building ML models using different health data modalities common in Africa.
- Calls for further research into algorithmic fairness and decolonizing ML to prevent harm from emerging applications in global health.
- Lays a foundation for understanding and applying fair ML for health in Africa and similarly underserved regions.

The paper argues ML has potential benefits for global health equity but risks exacerbating existing inequities without proactive consideration of relevant axes of disparities in the African context. It contributes an initial framework for identifying such attributes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores fairness attributes that should be considered for machine learning applications in global health, using Africa as a case study.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper explores fairness attributes that should be considered when developing or deploying machine learning models for health applications in the context of Africa. Specifically, it:

1) Identifies two categories of fairness attributes: 

- Axes of disparities between Africa and Western countries (e.g. colonial history, national income level, country of origin)

- Globally applicable axes of disparities contextualized for Africa (e.g. race, ethnicity, language, gender, sexual orientation, literacy/education level)  

2) Discusses how these attributes could lead to biases and unfairness issues at different stages of the ML pipeline (problem formulation, data collection, model development, model evaluation and deployment) for health applications in Africa.

3) Provides examples of how the axes of disparities manifest in different health data modalities like medical imaging, surveys, speech recognition, genomics etc.

4) Discusses implications for building fair ML models in this context, including adapting fairness criteria, mitigating distribution shifts when using pretrained models, and structural changes needed in African healthcare.

In summary, the main contribution is defining and delineating fairness attributes and their implications specifically for the application of machine learning to healthcare in the African context. This serves as a basis and call for further research into algorithmic fairness for global health equity.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose "fairness attributes" that should be considered for machine learning in the context of Africa. What are some of the key fairness attributes they identify and what is the rationale behind choosing those specific attributes?

2. The paper discusses both "axes of disparities between Africa and Western countries" and "globally applicable axes of disparities in the African context." What is the difference between these two categories of attributes and why is it important to make this distinction? 

3. The authors state that "If a model developed in the United States performs well across different races, it cannot be assumed that the model will also perform well across race, outside the United States." What is the reasoning behind this statement? What types of biases could emerge from making this assumption?

4. When discussing the "country of origin" attribute, the authors state that "Aggregate bias which may result in a one-size fits all model should be avoided..." What do they mean by "aggregate bias" in this context and how could it lead to problems with a one-size fits all model?

5. For the "language" attribute, what are some of the potential sources of bias and unfairness that could impact machine learning systems, especially in healthcare applications? 

6. When reviewing different data modalities (e.g. medical imaging, surveys), the authors connect potential limitations or biases to the axes of disparities. For a modality of your choice, choose one axis of disparity and one type of bias that could emerge and explain the connection.

7. The authors state "Access to basic health care for all persons...are essential for reducing disparities in health." How could improved access to healthcare also help improve the development of fairer machine learning systems? 

8. When discussing cautions around using pretrained models, the authors review three types of distribution shifts that could lead to model biases. Choose one and explain how it could cause issues when deploying ML models trained on Western data to African populations.  

9. The paper focuses specifically on Africa as a case study. Do you think some of the ideas around biases and fairness attributes could generalize to other developing countries and regions? Why or why not?

10. The authors conclude that their work serves as a "starting point" and call for more research on evaluating models, quantifying biases, and developing mitigation proposals. What are some specific next steps you would recommend to put some of these ideas around fairness for African populations into practice?
