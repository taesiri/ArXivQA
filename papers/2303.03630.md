# [No One Left Behind: Improving the Worst Categories in Long-Tailed   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03630)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the performance on worst-performing categories in long-tailed recognition. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Focusing only on average accuracy on a balanced test set can ignore poor performance on some categories, since it incurs little penalty for very low recall values.

2. Classes in the "Few" subset do not necessarily perform worse than "Many" or "Medium", so improving "Few" accuracy alone is insufficient. 

3. Optimizing for harmonic mean of per-class recall, rather than arithmetic mean, better ensures no categories are left behind.

4. A simple fine-tuning method with a novel geometric mean loss can improve worst-case and harmonic mean accuracy.

5. Ensembling the original and fine-tuned classifiers can combine strengths of both while adding little computational cost.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly optimizing for harmonic mean recall and minimum recall will improve worst-performing categories in long-tailed recognition compared to conventional approaches. The proposed methods aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Pointing out issues with the common evaluation scheme in long-tailed recognition research, which splits classes into "Head", "Medium", and "Few" subsets and reports accuracy on each. The authors argue this can be problematic because:

- Reporting average accuracy on each subset obscures whether some classes are completely misclassified.

- It's not necessarily true that "Few" classes perform worse than "Medium" or "Head". 

2. Proposing new metrics focused on improving the worst performing classes: harmonic mean of per-class recall and lowest recall (accuracy of worst class).

3. A novel method to optimize these metrics:

- A Geometric Mean Loss (GML) function that maximizes geometric mean of recalls as a surrogate for harmonic mean.

- Fine-tuning the classifier of any existing model with GML.

- An optional ensemble technique combining predictions of original and fine-tuned model.

4. Experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet based datasets showing the proposed method improves harmonic mean and lowest recall while maintaining overall accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results.

5. Analysis and visualizations demonstrating the method produces a more balanced distribution of per-class recall values.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying issues with common long-tailed recognition evaluation, proposing better metrics, and presenting a simple fine-tuning method to optimize these metrics and improve recall of the worst classes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a novel method to improve the worst-performing categories in long-tailed image recognition. The key idea is to optimize the harmonic mean of per-class recall rather than just the overall accuracy, using a surrogate loss called Geometric Mean Loss (GML) that maximizes the geometric mean. The method can be applied as a simple plug-in to existing models by retraining just the classifier, and further combines predictions from the original and retrained models. In summary, the paper aims to make sure no categories are left behind in long-tailed recognition.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in long-tailed recognition:

- Motivation: The paper argues that prior work in this field focuses too much on improving average accuracy across subsets or head vs. tail classes. Instead, it advocates focusing on the worst-performing classes and improving harmonic mean of per-class recall. This is a novel perspective compared to most existing work.

- Approach: The paper proposes a simple plug-in method that can be applied to many existing models through re-training the classifier. This makes it more flexible than methods that require end-to-end re-training or modification of the architecture. The proposed loss function GML is also novel for improving worst categories.

- Evaluation: The paper uses metrics like lowest recall, geometric mean, and harmonic mean of recall to emphasize performance on minority categories. This is more fine-grained than typical subset or head/tail accuracy. The visualizations of per-class recall distribution are also unique.

- Applicability: The paper shows consistent improvements by applying the method to various existing models like CE, BSCE, MiSLAS, PaCo on three benchmark datasets. This demonstrates the wide applicability of the approach.

- Simplicity: Compared to many recent methods involving multiple complex components, this paper's approach of re-training classifier and GML loss is relatively simple and easy to implement.

Overall, the novelty lies in its new perspective on focusing on worst categories rather than just head vs. tail, the flexibility of the approach, and the more fine-grained performance evaluation. The consistent gains demonstrate the idea's merit across diverse datasets and base models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the performance on datasets with higher imbalance ratios: The authors note that their method achieves good improvements on datasets with imbalance ratios up to 100, but the improvements are smaller on datasets with even higher imbalance ratios like ImageNet-LT. They suggest further research could aim to improve performance on datasets with imbalance ratios beyond 100.

- Combining with sample synthesis methods: The authors mention sample synthesis methods like SMOTE could potentially be combined with their approach to further improve performance. This could be an interesting direction to explore.

- Extending to other tasks beyond classification: The authors' approach focuses on classification, but they suggest it could potentially be extended to other tasks like detection and segmentation in long-tailed scenarios. Exploring this could be valuable future work.

- Using the geometric mean loss for other imbalanced learning problems: The proposed geometric mean loss aims to improve performance on tail classes, but the authors suggest it could also be useful for other imbalanced learning scenarios beyond long-tailed classification. Testing it in other contexts could be interesting.

- Developing better ensemble strategies: The authors propose a simple ensemble strategy to combine predictions, but mention more advanced schemes could further improve performance and be an interesting direction to study.

- Combining with meta-learning approaches: The authors suggest combining their approach with meta-learning techniques could further improve generalization on tail classes and should be explored in future work.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving performance on more challenging datasets, combining with other techniques like sample synthesis and meta-learning, extending to new tasks and problem settings, and developing more advanced ensemble strategies. The authors lay out several interesting avenues for future research building on their approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve the worst performing categories in long-tailed image recognition, where the training data is highly imbalanced across classes. It argues that conventional evaluation metrics like overall accuracy and per-subset accuracy are problematic, as they can hide categories with very poor accuracy. Instead, the authors advocate focusing on the harmonic mean of per-class recall, which punishes low recall values more strongly. They propose a simple plug-in method applicable to existing models, involving re-training the classifier with a novel loss function called GML that maximizes the geometric mean of per-class recall. They also suggest an optional ensemble technique to combine predictions from the original and re-trained classifiers. Experiments on CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT and Places-LT show the method improves worst-case and harmonic mean accuracy while maintaining high overall accuracy. Visualizations confirm it makes the per-class recall distribution more uniform. The approach serves to ensure no categories are "left behind" with near-zero accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called "No One Left Behind" to improve the performance of all categories in long-tailed image recognition. Long-tailed datasets contain a highly imbalanced number of examples per class, causing models trained on them to perform poorly on tail classes. Existing methods focus on improving average accuracy, but the authors show this can ignore tail classes with near-zero accuracy. They argue for focusing on harmonic mean of per-class recall to ensure low accuracy classes are improved. 

The proposed method fine-tunes an existing pretrained model using a new Geometric Mean Loss (GML) function that acts as a surrogate for maximizing harmonic mean accuracy. GML minimizes the negative log geometric mean of per-class probabilities on the training set. An optional ensemble technique combines predictions from the original and fine-tuned model for improved results. Experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and Places datasets show the method improves worst-class and harmonic mean accuracy while maintaining competitive overall accuracy. Visualizations confirm it produces more uniform per-class accuracy distributions. The simple plug-in approach is widely applicable across existing methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a simple plug-in method to improve the worst-performing categories in long-tailed image recognition. The method consists of three stages - first pre-training a model using any existing method, then re-training just the classifier with a proposed Geometric Mean Loss (GML) function while freezing the backbone, and finally optionally ensembling the predictions from the original and re-trained classifiers. GML aims to maximize the geometric mean of per-class recall as a surrogate for directly optimizing the intractable harmonic mean. This focuses on improving the lowest recall categories rather than just the overall accuracy. The optional ensemble technique averages the predictions from the original and re-trained classifiers to leverage their complementary strengths. The method can be applied on top of various existing long-tailed recognition techniques and improves the tail accuracy while maintaining overall accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet based long-tailed datasets validate the effectiveness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:

- It focuses on improving the performance of neural networks trained on long-tailed, imbalanced datasets. Such datasets have a few classes with lots of examples ("head" classes) and many classes with only a few examples ("tail" classes).

- Models trained on such datasets are known to perform much worse on tail classes compared to head classes. The common evaluation approach is to split classes into "head", "medium" and "tail" subsets based on number of examples per class, and report performance on each subset. 

- The authors argue that this evaluation scheme ignores the fact that some individual tail classes may have near-zero accuracy, even though the average tail accuracy seems decent. They emphasize the importance of improving worst-case class accuracy.

- The paper proposes to focus more on metrics like harmonic mean of per-class recalls, which accounts for very low accuracies, and lowest individual class recall. Their goal is to improve worst-performing classes and make sure no class is "left behind".

In summary, the key problem is the significant performance gap between head and tail classes in long-tailed learning, and common evaluation schemes can overlook classes that perform extremely poorly. The paper aims to improve worst-case class accuracy and make sure no class gets ignored.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to improve the worst-performing categories in long-tailed image recognition. The authors find that when trained on imbalanced datasets, neural networks exhibit highly varying per-class accuracy. They argue that the standard evaluation scheme of splitting classes into "head", "medium", and "tail" subsets and reporting their average accuracy can be problematic, as it does not reflect if some categories are completely misclassified. To address this, they advocate focusing on the harmonic mean of per-class recall to make sure no category is "left behind".

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to use the geometric mean (GM) of per-class recall as a surrogate objective for the harmonic mean (HM) of per-class recall. Why is HM more suitable than mean accuracy for the goal of improving worst-performing categories? What are the limitations of using GM as a surrogate for HM?

2. The proposed Geometric Mean Loss (GML) applies instance re-weighting similar to prior work like BSCE. What is the effect of this re-weighting in GML? Does it help improve the GM and HM compared to GML without re-weighting? 

3. The paper shows GML can be applied on top of various existing methods like BSCE, MiSLAS, PaCo etc. But it also mentions GML does not improve some methods like DiVE. What could be the reasons it does not work well for certain existing methods?

4. How does the proposed ensemble method combine predictions from the original and GML fine-tuned models? Does it require any special routing logic or can a simple averaging work? What are the effects of the temperature scaling used?

5. The paper emphasizes improving worst-performing categories through HM. But the overall accuracy is still important. Does GML end up sacrificing mean accuracy? How can both metrics be optimized jointly?

6. The motivation is to treat all classes equally instead of just focusing on "Few" classes. But aren't "Few" classes still more likely to be the worst-performing ones? Does GML end up improving "Few" classes more than "Many" classes?

7. Could GML be used directly for training from scratch instead of fine-tuning? Would that work better or worse than fine-tuning an existing model? What are the trade-offs?

8. How sensitive is GML to hyperparameter settings like learning rate, number of epochs etc. during fine-tuning? Is extensive tuning needed to make GML work with different base models?

9. The paper shows improved HM and lowest recall across datasets. But are there cases or datasets where GML does not help much? When would GML be most effective?

10. How does the computational overhead of GML scale compared to the base method it enhances? Is the ensemble method still efficient for large-scale datasets like full ImageNet?
