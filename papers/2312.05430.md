# [FT2TF: First-Person Statement Text-To-Talking Face Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional talking face generation methods rely on audio input, which comes with drawbacks of requiring high-quality audio and being resource-intensive for storage and processing. This paper aims to address this challenge by exploring the feasibility of substituting audio input with text input while ensuring detailed and natural facial expressions in the generated talking faces.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FT2TF - a one-stage end-to-end pipeline for talking face generation directly from first-person statement text input. The key components of FT2TF include:

1) Two specialized text encoders - A Global Emotion Text Encoder to capture overall emotional tones from the full text, and a Linguistic Text Encoder to extract semantic details from partial reference text. 

2) A Visual Encoder to encode visual features from reference talking face frames.

3) A Multi-Scale Cross-Attention Module to align and fuse textual and visual features.

4) A Visual Decoder to synthesize realistic talking faces from the fused features.

The entire pipeline requires only visual frames and text statements as inputs during inference, without needing other modalities like audio.

Main Contributions:
1) FT2TF achieves state-of-the-art in generating realistic, temporally coherent talking faces with accurate lip synchronization directly from first-person text input.

2) It enables effective manipulation of facial expressions by altering the input text statements.

3) Extensive experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 datasets demonstrate FT2TF's superior performance over existing methods in talking face generation across various quantitative and qualitative metrics.

In summary, the proposed FT2TF framework delivers high-quality text-driven talking face generation and establishes an effective baseline to bridge first-person statements and dynamic face synthesis for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FT2TF, a novel one-stage end-to-end pipeline for generating high-quality talking faces directly from first-person statement text and reference talking face frames, reaching state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes an end-to-end continuous-frame talking face generation method called FT2TF that can generate realistic talking faces by integrating visual and textual input. Specifically, it uses reference talking face frames and first-person statement text as input.

2. The proposed FT2TF pipeline enables effective manipulation of the facial expressions and lip movements of the generated talking faces by altering the input text. 

3. Extensive experiments conducted on the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of FT2TF in talking face generation. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative results show its ability to generate high-quality, natural, and emotionally expressive talking faces.
