# [Linear bandits with polylogarithmic minimax regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12042)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Studied:
- The paper studies the linear stochastic bandit problem, where at each time step the learning agent selects an action vector from a continuous set and receives a noisy linear reward dependent on the selected action and an unknown parameter vector. 

- Typical algorithms for this problem achieve regret (difference between the optimal cumulative reward and agent's cumulative reward) that scales as Ω(√T) with the time horizon T. The paper studies whether this lower bound can be broken for non-standard noise models where the noise level decreases as actions approach the unknown parameter.

Proposed Model and Algorithm:
- The paper proposes a stochastic linear bandit with a "vanishing noise" model where the noise is σt-subgaussian with σt2 ≤ 1 - <a_t,θ>2. So the noise decreases linearly as the action gets closer to unknown θ.  

- An algorithm called LinUCB-VN is proposed that uses a weighted least squares estimator to adapt to the vanishing noise. It selects "optimistic" actions using this estimator but also carefully controls the minimum eigenvalue of the design matrix to ensure sufficient exploration.

Main Results:
- Theoretical analysis shows LinUCB-VN achieves regret scaling as O(polylog(T)) compared to Ω(√T) lower bounds for standard algorithms. This breaks the regret barrier by exploiting the decreasing noise.

- Numerical experiments validate the polylogarithmic scaling. Also shows the design matrix achieved the eigenvalue relation λmin = Ω(√λmax) which enables tighter control of regret.

- Provides an adaptation of existing lower bounds to show the Ω(√T) regret applies to a slight perturbation of the proposed noise model.

- Posits that the ability to break the regret barrier is fundamentally linked to the decreasing noise allowing exploitation to dominate exploration.
