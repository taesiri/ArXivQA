# [DEYO: DETR with YOLO for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- DETR relies heavily on pre-training the backbone on ImageNet, limiting flexibility in backbone design and requiring expensive pre-training. 
- The one-to-one matching strategy provides limited supervision signals, resulting in an inadequately trained neck.
- Matching instability in early training stages causes backbone damage.

Proposed Solution:
- A new two-stage training method called "step-by-step training":
   - Stage 1: Use a classic detector (YOLOv8) pre-trained with one-to-many matching to initialize the backbone and neck.
   - Stage 2: Freeze backbone and neck from stage 1. Retrain lightweight decoder from scratch.

- This provides high-quality initialization of the neck, solves backbone damage from early unstable matching, and boosts performance without extra datasets.

- Using this approach, they design the first real-time end-to-end detector with a pure convolutional encoder, called DEYO (DETR + YOLO).

Main Contributions:

1) First training method for DETR that doesn't require additional datasets. Step-by-step training enhances performance and reduces training costs.

2) DEYO - the first real-time end-to-end detector using a pure convolutional encoder. Surpasses state-of-the-art real-time detectors in speed and accuracy without extra data.

3) Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed step-by-step training strategy and DEYO model design. DEYO also shows advantages in dense detection.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in DETR training methodology and model design to improve speed, accuracy and reduce training costs without reliance on supplementary datasets. The proposed DEYO detector sets a new state-of-the-art for real-time end-to-end detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage training method called "step-by-step training" which first uses a classic detector to pretrain the backbone and neck, then freezes them to train an end-to-end transformer detector from scratch, enabling the development of DEYO, the first real-time end-to-end object detector that surpasses state-of-the-art real-time detectors without relying on extra datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) Proposing a new two-stage training methodology called "step-by-step training" that provides high-quality pre-training for the detector's neck and solves the issue of backbone damage due to unstable matching early in DETR training. This significantly improves detector performance.

2) Developing the first real-time end-to-end object detector called DEYO using a purely convolutional encoder structure. DEYO surpasses state-of-the-art real-time detectors in both speed and accuracy without relying on extra training data.

3) Conducting extensive experiments and comparisons to previous methods, including various ablation studies, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy and model design. Experiments show superior performance of DEYO over other real-time detectors on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the step-by-step training approach to enable building a high-performance real-time end-to-end detector called DEYO that sets new state-of-the-art without requiring additional datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- DEYO (DETR with YOLO): The name of the proposed real-time end-to-end object detection model that combines DETR with YOLO.

- Step-by-step training: The innovative training methodology proposed that uses a YOLO model to pretrain the backbone and neck of the end-to-end model in the first stage before training the decoder in the second stage. 

- End-to-end detection: Building an object detector that directly predicts objects in an image without needing external post-processing steps like NMS. 

- DETR: DEtection TRansformer, an end-to-end object detector based on transformers.

- YOLO: You Only Look Once, a real-time object detection model.

- Encoder-decoder architecture: Using a CNN backbone and Feature Pyramid Network as the encoder to extract features, and a lightweight Transformer decoder to predict objects.  

- One-to-many vs one-to-one detection: Classic detectors use one-to-many assignment between ground truth and predictions, while DETR uses a one-to-one assignment.

- Query based detection: Treating object detection as a set prediction problem and using learned query embeddings to predict objects.

The key things the paper focuses on are developing a real-time end-to-end detector by combining YOLO and DETR using a novel step-by-step training strategy.
