# [DEYO: DETR with YOLO for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- DETR relies heavily on pre-training the backbone on ImageNet, limiting flexibility in backbone design and requiring expensive pre-training. 
- The one-to-one matching strategy provides limited supervision signals, resulting in an inadequately trained neck.
- Matching instability in early training stages causes backbone damage.

Proposed Solution:
- A new two-stage training method called "step-by-step training":
   - Stage 1: Use a classic detector (YOLOv8) pre-trained with one-to-many matching to initialize the backbone and neck.
   - Stage 2: Freeze backbone and neck from stage 1. Retrain lightweight decoder from scratch.

- This provides high-quality initialization of the neck, solves backbone damage from early unstable matching, and boosts performance without extra datasets.

- Using this approach, they design the first real-time end-to-end detector with a pure convolutional encoder, called DEYO (DETR + YOLO).

Main Contributions:

1) First training method for DETR that doesn't require additional datasets. Step-by-step training enhances performance and reduces training costs.

2) DEYO - the first real-time end-to-end detector using a pure convolutional encoder. Surpasses state-of-the-art real-time detectors in speed and accuracy without extra data.

3) Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed step-by-step training strategy and DEYO model design. DEYO also shows advantages in dense detection.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in DETR training methodology and model design to improve speed, accuracy and reduce training costs without reliance on supplementary datasets. The proposed DEYO detector sets a new state-of-the-art for real-time end-to-end detection.
