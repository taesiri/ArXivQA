# [Accuracy of TextFooler black box adversarial attacks on 01 loss sign   activation neural network ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Adversarial attacks remain a vulnerability in neural networks today. Recent work has shown that sign activation networks with 01 loss are robust to image adversarial attacks. This paper investigates if such networks are also robust against TextFooler - a popular black box text adversarial attack method. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors evaluate the robustness of 01 loss sign activation networks against TextFooler attacks on four text classification tasks - IMDB, Yelp, MR sentiment and AG news. They propose a novel CNN architecture called CNN01-FS that sums the activation outputs before the sign function rather than averaging. They also ensemble single hidden layer networks trained with a stochastic coordinate descent procedure.

Key Contributions:
- Show that ensembles of 01 loss sign activation networks have significantly higher adversarial accuracy against TextFooler compared to equivalent sigmoid activation networks across all tasks
- Propose CNN01-FS architecture that improves adversarial accuracy of CNN01 by orders of magnitude, making TextFooler ineffective
- Demonstrate computational feasibility of training sign activation networks at scale
- Provide evidence that 01 loss makes neural networks more robust to black box attacks by obscuring gradient information 

In summary, this paper makes a case for further research into sign activation networks as a defense against adversarial attacks on text, building on similar work in images. The proposed models significantly increase robustness against TextFooler attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper studies the accuracy of TextFooler black box adversarial attacks on 01 loss sign activation neural network ensembles for text classification, finding they are much harder to attack compared to sigmoid activation cross entropy and binary neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Demonstrating that ensembles of 01 loss sign activation neural networks are robust to black box text adversarial attacks from TextFooler across four text classification datasets. Specifically, the paper shows that the adversarial accuracy of these models is significantly higher compared to convolutional and feedforward networks with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss, as well as binary neural networks and random forests. The paper also introduces a new global pooling method called CNN01-FS that further improves adversarial accuracy. Overall, the robustness of 01 loss sign activation networks to text adversarial attacks suggests they could be promising for developing foolproof models.

In summary, the key contribution is showing the potential of 01 loss sign activation neural network ensembles to defend against black box text adversarial attacks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a stochastic coordinate descent (SCD) algorithm for training single hidden layer sign activation networks with 01 loss. How does this SCD procedure differ from standard gradient descent used for sigmoid activation networks? What modifications were made to enable training of non-convex sign activation networks?

2. The paper shows higher adversarial accuracy for ensembles of sign activation networks compared to sigmoid activation networks. What properties of the sign activation function and 01 loss contribute to this increased robustness? How do the decision boundaries and loss surface differ?

3. The CNN architecture proposed uses sign activations and sums the 1's after convolution rather than averaging. How does this "CNN01-FS" method differ from standard global average pooling? Why does it significantly improve adversarial accuracy compared to the basic CNN01?

4. The paper hypothesizes that TextFooler relies on output probabilities for its attack which are less informative for sign activation networks. Could alternative black-box attacks be more successful? What strategies could get around the obfuscated gradients of sign activation?  

5. How do the clean test accuracies of the sign activation networks compare to the sigmoid activation baselines? Is there a trade-off between standard and adversarial accuracy? How could clean accuracy be further improved?

6. The paper studies sign activation for NLP tasks. How do the embeddings and input representation differ from prior work on image classification? How are texts and words adapted as inputs? What changes were made to the network architectures?

7. What software libraries, tools, and hardware were used for efficient training and implementation? How long did models take to train compared to baseline methods? Could training be further sped up and scaled?

8. The method is evaluated on four text classification datasets. What are the key differences between these datasets and classification tasks? How do results vary across them? How could performance on lower accuracy datasets be improved? 

9. How were the baselines and comparisons selected in the experimental evaluation? What are the key strengths and weaknesses compared to the proposed method? Are there other promising methods that should be benchmarked?

10. The code and models are open-sourced. What opportunities exist for extensions and reproductions of this work by the community? What are interesting future directions for applying sign activation networks to NLP?
