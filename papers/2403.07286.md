## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multilingual text detection methods require collecting labeled data and retraining models when encountering new languages. This is cumbersome and causes catastrophic forgetting of seen languages.
- The paper proposes a new problem setting - to detect both seen and unseen languages in images without requiring labeling data or retraining for unseen languages.

Proposed Solution - MENTOR:
- Uses "zero-cost" printed text images as external language information. Printed texts are synthesized using known character sets of languages.
- Has 3 main components:
   - Dynamic Guide (DG): Learns to extract language features from printed texts
   - Text Finder (TF): Detects text regions in scene images in a language-agnostic way
   - Language Mapper (LM): Matches features of printed texts (from DG) and scene text (from TF) to identify language regions
- DG and TF are trained on seen languages. LM matches seen language features and is thereby able to generalize to unseen languages.
- No retraining needed for new languages. Only printed text images of new language needed.

Main Contributions:
- Defines a new problem setting for generalized multilingual text detection without needing annotation data or retraining for new languages.
- Proposes MENTOR method which matches external printed text features with scene text features to detect both seen and unseen languages.
- Achieves comparable performance to supervised methods on seen languages and outperforms other methods on unseen languages.
- Only requires easy-to-acquire printed text images of new languages instead of annotated data and model retraining.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MENTOR, a multilingual text detection framework that can detect and identify both seen and unseen language regions in images without requiring collection of unseen language training data or model retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new problem setting for generalized multi-language scene text detection, where the model should be able to identify both seen and unseen languages in images without relying on training data for the unseen languages or model retraining.

2) Developing a novel multilingual text detector called MENTOR that realizes a learning strategy in-between zero-shot learning and few-shot learning. It uses synthesized printed texts of languages and seen languages to learn a meta-mapping function to detect unseen languages. 

3) Designing a data augmentation method to balance the distribution of languages in the training data. Also developing an efficient way to generate printed text images to serve as auxiliary language information.

4) Demonstrating through experiments that MENTOR can achieve comparable performance to supervised methods on seen languages and outperforms other methods on detecting unseen languages.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating a new generalized multilingual text detection problem and developing a model that can detect both seen and unseen languages without retraining or annotated data for the new languages.

The paper proposes a new framework called "MENTOR" for multilingual scene text detection that can detect both seen and unseen languages without requiring training data or retraining for the unseen languages. Key aspects include using synthesized printed texts as "zero-cost" external language information, learning a meta-mapping from printed texts to language-specific kernels, matching scene text features to printed text attributes, and progressive comparison using dynamic convolution guided by the language-specific kernels.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new problem setting for generalized multilingual text detection. What is the key difference compared to previous problem settings? What challenges does this new setting aim to address?

2. The paper utilizes "zero-cost" printed text images as external information. Why are printed texts chosen instead of other language descriptors? What are the benefits of using printed texts? 

3. The Dynamic Guide module extracts a compact language-specific representation from multiple printed text images. Explain the process and rationale behind aggregating information from multiple printed text images. 

4. The Text Finder module consists of two sub-branches for language-agnostic text detection and language classification. Why is it beneficial to separate these two functions? How do they work together?

5. The Language Mapper matches printed text attributes with scene text features using dynamic kernels. Explain the motivation and workflow of using input-dependent dynamic kernels for this matching.

6. Contrastive learning is utilized in the Language Mapper to distinguish between similar languages. How is the contrastive loss specifically incorporated? What languages does it help distinguish?

7. Synthetic text generation is used to create a more balanced multilingual dataset. What is the approach for synthetic text generation? Why is it necessary?

8. What is the difference between the "intersection" and "disjoint" synthetic datasets? What issue arose with the disjoint dataset and how was it resolved? 

9. The paper compares with supervised methods. How does the performance on seen vs unseen languages compare? What conclusions can be drawn?

10. What abilities and limitations exist with the current method? What future work could be done to build upon the approach?
