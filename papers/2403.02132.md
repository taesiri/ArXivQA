# [UB-FineNet: Urban Building Fine-grained Classification Network for   Open-access Satellite Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fine-grained classification of urban buildings from overhead satellite imagery is crucial for applications like urban planning and infrastructure development. However, this task faces two key challenges - (1) Low resolution of publicly available satellite images, lacking small-scale building details (2) Severe class imbalance between different categories of buildings, due to the long-tail distribution.

Proposed Solution:
A two-phase strategy is proposed - 

(1) Image Super-Resolution: A conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is used to enhance the resolution of satellite images. It leverages aerial-satellite domain adaptation through a deviation correction module, to avoid distorting building features.

(2) Building Classification: A lightweight classification network (UB-FineNet) based on ShuffleNetV2 is proposed. Two key components are introduced to improve robustness and handle class imbalance:
(i) Category Information Balancing Module (CIBM): Dynamically computes sample weights per category based on intra-class feature distances. Forces model to focus on inter-class differences.
(ii) Contrastive Supervision (CS): Supervises model training using features from an ImageNet pre-trained model. Distills semantic knowledge and improves convergence.

Main Contributions:
- A new framework for overhead image based fine-grained classification of urban buildings, using only openly available low-resolution satellite data
- CIBM module to explicitly handle class imbalance during network training
- Contrastive supervision technique to benefit from knowledge distillation 
- Extensive experiments on a real-world building dataset from Hong Kong, demonstrating accuracy comparable to street-view image techniques

The proposed approach can effectively turn low resolution overhead images into a valuable source of urban building intelligence, to aid applications like city planning, infrastructure development etc.
