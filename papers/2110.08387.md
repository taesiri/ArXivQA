# [Generated Knowledge Prompting for Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08387)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: Can extracting and prompting relevant knowledge statements from language models improve their performance on commonsense reasoning tasks, even without additional training or access to knowledge bases? The key hypothesis appears to be that generating task-relevant knowledge statements from language models and providing them as prompts can enhance the models' reasoning capabilities. The paper investigates whether this knowledge prompting approach can boost performance on commonsense reasoning benchmarks, compared to using the vanilla models or methods relying on external knowledge sources.In summary, the central research question is whether eliciting symbolic knowledge statements from language models themselves, and prompting the models with this knowledge during inference, can improve commonsense reasoning - even on top of large pretrained models and without extra training or knowledge bases. The paper aims to test this hypothesis across different commonsense reasoning datasets and models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Generated Knowledge Prompting to improve commonsense reasoning performance of language models. The key ideas are:- Generate knowledge statements from a language model by conditioning on human-written few-shot demonstrations of question-knowledge pairs for a given task. This allows eliciting helpful knowledge flexibly beyond pre-defined templates.- Prompt an inference language model with the generated knowledge statements and select the prediction from the prompt that results in highest confidence. This allows integrating knowledge without finetuning the inference model. - The proposed method sets new state-of-the-art results on several commonsense reasoning benchmarks by improving both zero-shot and finetuned inference models.- Analysis shows the method's effectiveness comes from high quality and quantity of generated knowledge, as well as the strategy for integrating knowledge into the inference model.- The method highlights the value of symbolic knowledge representation for improving neural network reasoning, even when the knowledge is generated by the models themselves.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a simple yet effective approach to leverage knowledge flexibly elicited from language models themselves to improve commonsense reasoning, without requiring finetuning or access to knowledge bases. The effectiveness is empirically shown across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related research on external knowledge for commonsense reasoning:- Unlike many prior works that incorporate knowledge via finetuning or joint training, this paper uses a simple prompt-based method that does not require any model finetuning. This makes the approach easy to apply to new models and tasks. - Compared to prior prompt-based methods like self-talk and contrastive explanations, this work can generate more flexible knowledge beyond a fixed set of templates. The key is using human demonstrations to show the model examples of desired knowledge.- The paper shows strong gains over baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art on several commonsense reasoning benchmarks. The improvements are shown to be due to the quality and diversity of generated knowledge.- Retrieval-based knowledge methods rely on the existence of an appropriate external knowledge source. This paper's generation-based approach does not need a separate knowledge base and works well even without one.- Analysis shows the method is especially effective for smaller models, enabling lightweight yet accurate reasoning. The knowledge also appears to amplify knowledge already within a model. - Human evaluation and examples demonstrate the knowledge reduces commonsense reasoning to more explicit forms of reasoning supported by language models. This highlights the role of symbolic knowledge in neural reasoning.In summary, this work makes progress on flexible and effective integration of external knowledge into language models for commonsense reasoning. The human-guided prompting approach and analysis provide useful insights for knowledge-enhanced reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Applying the generated knowledge prompting method to other tasks beyond commonsense reasoning, such as domain-specific question answering. The authors suggest their approach could be generalized to incorporate domain knowledge into models for improved performance on various NLP tasks.- Exploring different methods for generating knowledge statements beyond few-shot prompting. While prompting worked well in their experiments, the authors suggest investigating other techniques like constrained decoding could further expand the flexibility and diversity of generated knowledge.- Studying the integration of knowledge during inference in more depth. The authors propose analyzing the behavior of models more extensively when incorporating symbolic knowledge, to better understand the interplay between neural and symbolic reasoning.- Improving the factuality and specificity of generated knowledge statements. The authors' analysis found these properties affected the helpfulness of knowledge for reasoning, so enhancing them is an important direction. Techniques like retrieval and grounding could help.- Leveraging model-generated knowledge to rapidly construct task-specific knowledge bases. The authors suggest their elicitation method could enable massively populating knowledge bases for new tasks from scratch.- Developing methods that can explain when and why generated knowledge improves or harms reasoning. The authors suggest interpretability is key for safely deploying knowledge-augmented systems.In summary, the main future directions are generalizing the approach to more tasks, generating higher quality knowledge, better integrating and interpreting knowledge, and rapidly constructing custom knowledge bases. Advancing these areas could significantly expand the usefulness of model-generated knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Generated Knowledge Prompting to improve commonsense reasoning performance of language models. The key idea is to use a language model to generate relevant knowledge statements for a given question, then provide these statements as additional input to the same or another language model to help it better answer the question. The knowledge statements are elicited by prompting the language model with a few human-written demonstration examples of question-knowledge pairs for the task. During inference, each generated knowledge statement is used to augment the original question, predictions are made with each prompt, and the prediction with the highest confidence is selected. Experiments on recent commonsense QA datasets show improvements using this method with both zero-shot and finetuned language models, achieving new state-of-the-art results on some benchmarks. Analysis indicates the performance gains are due to the high quality and diversity of generated knowledge. Overall, the work highlights how language models can serve as flexible sources of knowledge to enhance their own reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method called generated knowledge prompting to improve commonsense reasoning performance of language models. The key idea is to first generate statements containing knowledge relevant to a given question by prompting a language model with a few human-written demonstrations. Then, each generated statement is used to augment the original question before feeding to a second language model that makes the final prediction. Among predictions made with different prompts, the one with the highest confidence score is selected. Experiments on recent commonsense reasoning benchmarks like NumerSense, CommonsenseQA, and QASC show that this approach consistently improves over baseline models without knowledge prompting. The method is flexible as it works for both zero-shot and finetuned language models. Analysis indicates that the high quality and diversity of generated knowledge are crucial factors. The knowledge statements are found to reduce commonsense problems into more explicit reasoning procedures supported by language models. Overall, this work highlights how symbolic knowledge elicited from language models themselves can be effectively utilized to enhance model performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a method called Generated Knowledge Prompting for improving commonsense reasoning. The key idea is to generate helpful knowledge statements from a language model, then provide these statements as prompts when answering a question. Specifically, they first generate question-related knowledge by conditioning a language model on a few-shot prompt containing task demonstrations. Then they prompt a separate inference model with the generated knowledge by concatenating each statement with the question. Each knowledge-augmented input produces a prediction, and they select the one with maximum confidence. This allows integrating knowledge into predictions of off-the-shelf and finetuned language models without any custom training. Experiments show their method boosts strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art on numerical, general, and scientific commonsense reasoning benchmarks. The success is attributed to the high quality and diversity of generated knowledge, and the max-ensembling algorithm's ability to select good knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing two questions:1. Can external knowledge help improve performance on commonsense reasoning tasks, even on top of large pretrained models like T5-11B? 2. Can we generate useful knowledge from language models themselves, without requiring access to structured knowledge bases or task-specific finetuning?The authors investigate these questions by proposing a method called "Generated Knowledge Prompting" which involves generating knowledge statements from a language model using few-shot demonstrations, then using those statements to prompt an inference model to make predictions. Their goal is to provide a flexible way to incorporate external knowledge that works with both zero-shot and finetuned models, without needing custom supervision or access to knowledge bases.In summary, the paper is exploring whether language models can serve as sources of high-quality, flexible knowledge to improve commonsense reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models, in a way that is easy to apply across a variety of setups and tasks.
