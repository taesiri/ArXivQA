# [Easy-to-Hard Generalization: Scalable Alignment Beyond Human Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Current AI alignment methods rely on human supervision, limiting model capabilities to human levels. This raises the challenge of continuing to improve systems beyond human capabilities, which the authors term "scalable oversight." Specifically, can models be trained on easier tasks but still solve more complex problems without direct human supervision? The authors refer to this as "easy-to-hard generalization."

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that evaluation is easier than generation. So the authors first train process-supervised reward models (PRMs) on easy problems to act as easy-to-hard evaluators. Then they use these PRMs to score solutions to harder problems, facilitating easy-to-hard generalization in generators via re-ranking sampled solutions or reinforcement learning.  

Contributions:
- Propose using PRMs as easy-to-hard evaluators to enable easy-to-hard generalization in generators beyond just prompting or supervised fine-tuning.
- Introduce Outcome & Process Reward Models (OPRMs) combining strengths of outcome and process supervision.
- Show PRM re-ranking substantially improves performance on harder problems, demonstrating better easy-to-hard generalization for evaluators over generators.  
- Demonstrate optimization of generators against PRM evaluators via RL outperforms training on full dataset, highlighting effectiveness of leveraging easy-to-hard evaluation.
- Achieve new SOTA on MATH dataset through easy-to-hard generalization, suggesting promising path to systems advancing beyond frontier of human supervision.

In summary, the paper makes both conceptual and empirical contributions in using easy-to-hard evaluators to unlock stronger easy-to-hard generalization in generators, enabling progress on complex tasks without direct human supervision.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using process-supervised reward models trained on easy tasks to evaluate and improve policy models on harder tasks, enabling AI systems to advance beyond the scope of direct human supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a novel approach to scalable AI alignment that enables models to solve complex problems beyond human capabilities, without requiring direct human supervision on those hard tasks. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Train process-supervised reward models (evaluators) on easy tasks that have human demonstrations. These evaluators can generalize surprisingly well to provide rewards/evaluations on harder, out-of-distribution tasks.

2) Use these easy-trained evaluators that generalize to hard tasks to provide rewards/guidance to optimize policy models (generators). This is done via either re-ranking model samples or reinforcement learning.

3) Show that this approach of "easy-to-hard generalization from evaluators" enables much stronger "easy-to-hard generalization in generators" than simply training the generators on easy tasks. For example, a 7B parameter model trained only on easy math problems can solve 34% of hard competition-level math problems by using an easy-trained evaluator, compared to only 12% accuracy without it.

So in summary, the key insight is that evaluation generalizes more easily than generation, and leveraging easy-to-hard generalization in evaluators is an effective technique to improve easy-to-hard generalization in generators, enabling models to solve complex tasks without direct human supervision. This provides a promising approach to scalable AI alignment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key keywords and terms appear to be:

- Easy-to-hard generalization
- Scalable alignment 
- Process-supervised reward models (PRMs)
- Outcome reward models (ORMs)  
- Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Mathematical reasoning
- MATH dataset
- Levels 1-3 as "easy" tasks
- Levels 4-5 as "hard" tasks

The paper explores using process-supervised reward models, trained on easy tasks (levels 1-3 of the MATH dataset), to evaluate and enhance policy models on harder tasks (levels 4-5). This is framed as an "easy-to-hard generalization" approach to enable capabilities beyond human supervision. The key methods involve using the PRMs for re-ranking or reinforcement learning to optimize the policy models. Overall, the paper aims to develop techniques for "scalable alignment" of AI systems by relying primarily on human supervision of easier tasks. The MATH mathematical reasoning tasks, with their delineated difficulty levels, serve as the testbed for evaluating these methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using process-supervised reward models (PRMs) as easy-to-hard evaluators. How does the training process and functionality of PRMs differ from outcome-supervised reward models (ORMs)? What are the relative advantages of each approach?

2. The paper introduces a new model called the Outcome & Process Reward Model (OPRM). How does this model combine the strengths of PRMs and ORMs? What specific aspects of each model does it incorporate? 

3. The authors find that weighted voting outperforms best-of-n re-ranking when using the PRMs/OPRMs as evaluators. What factors may contribute to this difference compared to prior work? How could the weighted voting approach be further optimized?  

4. For the reinforcement learning experiments, why does the paper find that DPO and PPO substantially outperform ReST? What modifications could be made to ReST to improve its performance in this setting?

5. How does the performance of using only easy tasks for reward model training and RL fine-tuning compare to using the full dataset? What factors may explain why easy tasks sometimes outperform the full dataset?

6. The authors highlight that evaluation is easier than generation. How does leveraging easy-to-hard generalization in evaluators enable stronger easy-to-hard generalization in generators? What is the theoretical basis for this technique?

7. How suitable is the MATH dataset for studying easy-to-hard generalization compared to other reasoning datasets? What are its key advantages and disadvantages? Are the results likely to transfer to other complex reasoning domains?

8. The paper assumes access to high-quality training data on easy tasks. How would the approach be affected by lower quality or noisier easy task demonstrations? How could it be adapted to handle unreliable easy task data?

9. For real-world application, what methods could be used to automatically determine or classify the difficulty levels of new unseen tasks? How could the approach handle tasks that do not neatly fit into a predefined difficulty taxonomy?  

10. The method relies on breaking down complex reasoning chains. How well would it handle tasks where holistic, intuitive reasoning is more important than mathematical step-by-step logic? Are there ways to modify the approach to accommodate less structured reasoning?
