# [From Node Interaction to Hop Interaction: New Effective and Scalable   Graph Learning Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

Can we develop a new graph learning paradigm to address the scalability and over-smoothing limitations of existing graph neural networks simultaneously, achieving high performance while maintaining efficiency?

The key hypotheses are:

1) By converting the interaction target in GNNs from nodes to multi-hop features inside each node, we can achieve effective feature discrimination without complex node interactions.

2) Conducting non-linear interactions among the pre-processed multi-hop features can capture discriminative clues for node classification and enhance model performance. 

3) The proposed hop interaction framework is general and flexible to incorporate advanced objectives like self-supervised learning for further improvements.

4) The hop interaction paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph datasets while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

In summary, the paper proposes a new hop interaction paradigm for graph representation learning to achieve effectiveness, scalability, and flexibility simultaneously. The core idea is to shift the interaction target in GNNs from nodes to multi-hop features within each node. This is hypothesized to avoid the scalability issue of node interactions while still capturing informative feature co-occurrences for discrimination. Experiments validate these hypotheses, showing superior performance and efficiency.
