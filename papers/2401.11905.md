# [Considerations on Approaches and Metrics in Automated Theorem   Generation/Finding in Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the open problem stated in Larry Wos' 1988 book "Automated Reasoning: 33 Basic Research Problems", specifically Problem 31 on identifying properties to allow automated reasoning systems to find new and interesting theorems, not just prove conjectured ones. This remains an active area of research. Finding new theorems is achievable but separating uninteresting trivial facts from new interesting ones is much harder. 

Approaches to Automated Theorem Generation/Discovery:
The paper discusses different approaches like inductive (from examples to general conclusions), generative (mechanically generating then testing conjectures), manipulative (modifying existing theorems) and deductive (logical consequences from axioms/previous theorems). The deductive approach has the advantage of only generating logical consequences but the challenge is avoiding uninteresting ones.

Proposed Solution - Metrics and Filters for Interesting Theorems:
The paper outlines common metrics used to filter uninteresting trivial theorems, like obviousness based on number of inferences, weight based on formula size, surprisingness based on new relationships discovered. But notes these measures need validation. The general algorithm is to select axioms/rules, generate new facts, filter out uninteresting ones, until some stopping condition.

Key Contribution - Undecidability Result:
The paper proves it is undecidable to determine if a Turing Machine can produce interesting theorems, by applying Rice's Theorem. So judging theorem provers' capability to find interesting theorems is non-deterministic, at best relying on heuristics. The paper argues this requires empirical studies on what makes a geometry theorem interesting.

Proposed Empirical Study - Surveys on Interestingness: 
The paper proposes designing surveys for math experts on situations using "interesting theorem", reasons for interest/non-interest, and rating importance of hypothesized characteristics. This could better define interestingness to then evaluate automated theorem finding systems.

In summary, the key contribution is an undecidability result applying to the open problem of identifying automated reasoning systems that can find interesting new theorems, and proposing empirical studies to help guide the heuristic guidance of such systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an undecidability result showing that it is impossible to have an algorithm that definitively determines whether a program for automatically generating theorems can produce interesting theorems, argues this means judging interestingness must rely on heuristics, and proposes expert surveys to help define interestingness of geometric theorems to aid in developing and evaluating automated theorem proving systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents an undecidability result proving that having an algorithmic procedure that decides for every possible Turing Machine that produces theorems, whether it is able to produce also interesting theorems, is an undecidable problem. 

2. It argues that judging whether a theorem prover is able to produce interesting theorems remains a non-deterministic task, at best a task to be addressed by programs based on algorithms guided by heuristics criteria.

3. It introduces the structure of two expert surveys to empirically explore the concept of "interestingness" of theorems in geometry. The goal is to reach an agreement on what makes a geometric theorem interesting, which can then inform the design of theorem provers aimed at discovering interesting new theorems.

So in summary, the paper makes both a theoretical contribution through the undecidability result, and outlines an empirical research program to elucidate the concept of interestingness in geometric theorems, which can ultimately help guide the development of automated theorem finding systems.

The paper discusses different approaches for automated theorem generation and finding in geometry. It analyzes what makes a theorem "interesting" versus "uninteresting" and proposes expert surveys to validate metrics and characteristics of interesting theorems. A key result is an undecidability result about having an algorithm that can determine if a theorem prover will generate interesting theorems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes conducting two expert surveys to reach agreement on what makes a geometric theorem "interesting." What are some limitations or challenges with using surveys to determine this, especially given the subjectivity involved?

2. The first survey asks experts to provide examples of theorems they consider interesting or uninteresting. What criteria could be used to select appropriate experts to participate and ensure quality responses?  

3. The authors mention applying filters to separate "weeds" (uninteresting theorems) from "wheat" (interesting theorems). What are some of the key metrics proposed in these filters and how could they be validated?

4. The paper mentions an undecidability result regarding deterministically judging whether a theorem prover can produce interesting theorems. What are the implications of this in designing an effective theorem prover?

5. What are some potential global versus local reasons a geometric theorem could be considered interesting, as mentioned in the paper? Provide some examples.  

6. The surveys proposed focus specifically on geometry. What considerations would be necessary in expanding this approach to determine interestingness across wider fields of mathematics?

7. What software or processes could be used to efficiently analyze the textual responses collected in the first proposed survey? How could responses best be coded into quantitative data?  

8. The second survey is intended to validate whether proposed characteristics are sufficient to determine if a theorem is interesting. What statistical analysis methods would be appropriate to assess this?  

9. How could interestingness metrics be incorporated into automated theorem proving software to improve efficiency or effectiveness? What measures could evaluate this impact?

10. What ethical considerations around data privacy, transparency, or bias should be considered in designing and conducting the proposed surveys? How could issues be mitigated?
