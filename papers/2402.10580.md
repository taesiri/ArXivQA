# [Efficient Multi-task Uncertainties for Joint Semantic Segmentation and   Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks often suffer from issues like overconfidence, lack of explainability, and inability to identify out-of-distribution inputs. Quantifying predictive uncertainty has been proposed as a solution, but existing methods are computationally expensive or require complex modifications. 
- Many real-world applications like autonomous driving are multi-modal, benefiting from joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation. However, uncertainty quantification in this multi-task context has not been explored.

Methods:
- Evaluated multiple uncertainty quantification methods (MCD, DSE, DE) on three models - SegFormer (segmentation), DepthFormer (depth), and SegDepthFormer (both).
- Compared single-task vs multi-task learning and impact on uncertainty quality. Multi-task learning improved uncertainty estimates.
- Proposed EMUFormer - a student-teacher distillation method to efficiently estimate uncertainties for joint semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of uncertainties for joint semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Revealed benefits of multi-task learning for uncertainty quality.
- EMUFormer leverages teacher's uncertainties to achieve SOTA segmentation and depth performance on Cityscapes and NYUv2 datasets, while matching teacher model's uncertainty quality despite 30x faster inference.
- Showed that incorporating uncertainties through Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood loss in EMUFormer boosted depth performance over regular losses.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that multi-task learning can improve uncertainty estimates and proposes an efficient student-teacher distillation method called EMUFormer to achieve state-of-the-art joint semantic segmentation and depth estimation along with high-quality uncertainties for both tasks.
