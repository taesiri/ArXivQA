# [Evaluating Gender Bias in Large Language Models via Chain-of-Thought   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) show impressive reasoning abilities but also tend to learn and reproduce societal biases. It is unclear if they can mitigate biases in unscalable tasks like arithmetic and symbolic reasoning where performance does not necessarily improve with model size. 

- The paper investigates whether chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, where the model articulates its reasoning step-by-step, can mitigate gender bias in LLMs for an unscalable task.

Methodology:
- The authors create a novel benchmark for Multi-Step Gender Bias Reasoning (MGBR) where the model is given a list of feminine, masculine and gendered occupational words. 

- The task is to count the number of feminine or masculine words. Bias is evaluated by the difference in accuracy between lists with just feminine/masculine words versus lists also containing occupational words.

- CoT requires the model to indicate whether each word is feminine or masculine before making the final prediction.

Results:
- Without CoT, most LLMs demonstrate high gender bias by incorrectly categorizing gender-neutral occupations, despite the simplicity of the counting task.

- CoT prompting is shown to significantly reduce unconscious social bias in LLMs and lead to more fair predictions. Analysis confirms CoT's effectiveness increases with model size.

- MGBR evaluation is correlated with downstream bias benchmarks, assessing a complementary form of bias compared to existing intrinsic bias metrics.

Main Contributions:
- Novel unscalable task and benchmark (MGBR) to evaluate gender bias requiring both arithmetic and symbolic reasoning

- Demonstrates CoT prompting mitigates gender bias in unscalable tasks by making models explicitly articulate reasoning

- Provides analysis connecting effectiveness of CoT debiasing to model capabilities needed for the approach

- Establishes complementary nature of MGBR benchmark to both downstream and intrinsic bias evaluations


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates whether Chain-of-Thought prompting can mitigate gender bias in large language models on an unscalable task involving counting feminine and masculine words, finding that it reduces unconscious social bias and encourages fair predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new benchmark task called Multi-step Gender Bias Reasoning (MGBR) to evaluate gender bias in large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- They create a novel benchmark that provides a list of words (feminine, masculine, and stereotypical occupational words) to LLMs and asks them to count the number of feminine or masculine words. This allows evaluating whether LLMs incorrectly associate gender-neutral occupations to a particular gender, indicating bias.

- They demonstrate that without explicit step-by-step guidance, most LLMs make socially biased predictions on this simple counting task. 

- They show that requiring LLMs to provide natural language explanations on whether each word is feminine or masculine using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps mitigate unconscious gender bias and leads to more fair predictions.

- They find that their CoT debiasing approach also helps reduce gender bias in downstream tasks such as question answering and natural language inference based on existing benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new benchmark and mitigation approach to evaluate and reduce gender bias in LLMs by requiring explicit step-by-step reasoning.

The paper examines using chain-of-thought prompting to mitigate gender bias in large language models on unscalable reasoning tasks. It constructs a new benchmark called multi-step gender bias reasoning (MGBR) which involves counting gendered and occupational words. Experiments show chain-of-thought prompting reduces unconscious bias and encourages fair predictions in the models, demonstrating its effectiveness for bias mitigation compared to just using debiasing prompts. The analysis also explores the relationships between MGBR and other bias evaluation benchmarks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark task called Multi-step Gender Bias Reasoning (MGBR). Can you explain in detail the process of creating this benchmark, including how the word lists are constructed and how the bias scores are calculated?

2. The key idea in MGBR is to evaluate gender bias based on the difference in accuracy between gendered word lists and lists with additional occupational words. Why is this an effective way to measure bias? How does it encapsulate both arithmetic and symbolic reasoning?

3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is shown to mitigate bias in the MGBR task. Can you analyze the step-by-step predictions made using CoT and explain how explicitly categorizing words as masculine/feminine encourages fairer predictions? 

4. The results show that larger language models tend to have higher correlation between their bias scores and human annotations. What does this suggest about the relationship between model scale and capturing human-like biases?

5. The paper demonstrates that CoT debiasing also works for existing bias benchmarks like BBQ and BNLI. How exactly is the debiasing process adapted to these downstream tasks? What role does the gender classification capability of models play here?

6. While CoT prompting reduces bias, the paper notes some limitations regarding non-English languages and non-binary genders. Can you suggest ways to extend the MGBR approach to mitigate these limitations? What challenges might arise?

7. The paper focuses solely on occupational words for evaluating gender bias associations. Could the methodology be applied to study biases related to other attributes like race, religion etc? Would the overall conclusions still hold?

8. The results show that simple debiasing instructions are inadequate for the MGBR task. Why do you think explicit step-by-step reasoning is more impactful compared to general guidelines asking models not to be biased?

9. The authors use specific lists of feminine, masculine and occupational words from prior work. Do you think the overall conclusions would change significantly if different word lists were used instead? Why or why not?

10. The paper performs intrinsic bias evaluation. How might the results differ for extrinsic bias measures that evaluate social biases in downstream tasks? Can the debiasing transfer to real-world applications?
