# [LangGPT: Rethinking Structured Reusable Prompt Design Framework for LLMs   from the Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Formulating high-quality prompts to effectively instruct large language models (LLMs) is challenging, requiring extensive expertise. 
- Existing prompt engineering research provides fragmented principles and empirically-dependent optimizers lacking structured templates. This results in high learning costs and low reusability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose LangGPT, a structured dual-layer prompt design framework to improve generalization and reusability. 
- LangGPT has predefined "inherent" modules covering key aspects and "extension" modules for customization. Modules contain basic elements providing instructions.
- LangGPT draws ideas from programming languages to provide systematic, prescriptive and reusable templates while retaining flexibility.

Key Contributions:
- Definition of structured prompt design rules and templates as a "programming language" for instructing LLMs. Reduces learning cost.
- Demonstrated experimentally that LangGPT prompts better induce LLMs to execute tasks compared to baselines.
- Showed LangGPT can guide LLMs to generate high-quality prompts automatically.
- Built a community for sharing prompt designs and surveyed ease-of-use indicating strong user approval.

In summary, the paper introduces a well-structured dual-layer prompt framework called LangGPT that improves reusability and generalization. Experiments and user studies validate its ability to better instruct LLMs and generate prompts compared to existing approaches.
