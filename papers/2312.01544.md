# [KEEC: Embed to Control on An Equivariant Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01544)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Koopman Embed to Equivariant Control (KEEC) for performing optimal control of complex nonlinear dynamical systems without relying on explicit models of the systems. The core idea is to utilize Koopman operator theory to learn an embedding that maps the nonlinear system manifold to an equivariant geometry on which control tasks can be effectively solved. Specifically, KEEC first learns a diffeomorphic Koopman embedding that preserves key geometric properties like distances and vector fields. This allows transforming the original control problem into an equivalent problem on the latent equivariant geometry. Then, KEEC formulates an equivariant value function and derives analytical optimal actions on this value function, achieving quadratic convergence. Through experiments on challenging control tasks like pendulum swing-up and Lorenz-63 stabilization, KEEC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms. The results highlight the significance of discovering symmetric, equivariant representations and utilizing differential geometric information for complex optimal control problems.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel control framework called Koopman Embed to Equivariant Control (KEEC) that learns an equivariant geometry induced by the Koopman operator which is diffeomorphic to the original state space manifold, formulates an equivariant value function on this geometry to achieve invariance with the original value function, derives an analytical optimal policy using differential information to ensure quadratic convergence, and demonstrates superior performance in stabilizing challenging dynamical systems like the pendulum and Lorenz-63 compared to model-based and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It establishes an equivariant geometry induced by the Koopman operator that is diffeomorphic to the original manifold of the dynamical system. This allows performing optimal control within the equivariant geometry while achieving invariant effects on the original manifold.

2. It proposes an equivariant value function defined on the equivariant geometry, ensuring it mirrors the invariance properties of the original value function. 

3. It derives an analytical form for optimal actions on the equivariant value function using differential information from the equivariant geometry. This allows quadratic convergence rates for the equivariant value function.

4. It shows through experiments that imposing isometric and isomorphic constraints, to ensure compactness and smoothness of the equivariant geometry, leads to superior performance compared to not having such constraints.

5. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Koopman Embed to Equivariant Control (KEEC) method in stabilizing challenging dynamical systems like the chaotic Lorenz-63 system.

In summary, the key innovation is using concepts from group representation theory and Koopman operator theory to establish an equivariant geometry that mirrors invariant properties of the original nonlinear dynamical system, thereby enabling performant and robust optimal control.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of enabling optimal control in unknown and complex dynamical systems, such as chaotic and non-linear systems, without relying on prior domain knowledge of the system dynamics. Specifically, the goal is to establish an equivariant geometry that mirrors the manifold defined by the dynamical system, so that optimal control can be performed within this corresponding geometry. However, discovering and controlling such a manifold is non-trivial.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called Koopman Embed to Equivariant Control (KEEC) to address this challenge. The key ideas are:

1) Use the Koopman operator theory to learn and embed the trajectories of an unknown dynamical system into a Lie group. The Koopman operator provides an invariant linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems. This establishes an equivariant geometry diffeomorphic to the original state manifold.

2) Formulate an equivariant value function for reinforcement learning on this equivariant geometry. This value function exhibits invariance properties mirroring the original value function defined on the state manifold.

3) Derive an analytical form for the optimal actions based on the differential information available on the equivariant geometry. This allows quadratic convergence rates for the equivariant value function.

Main Contributions:

- Establishes connection between Koopman operator theory and equivariant geometry through Lie group representation.

- Introduces the concept of an equivariant value function defined on the Lie group, invariant to the original value function.

- Derives analytical optimal actions and proves quadratic convergence rates for the equivariant value function.

- Empirically demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art RL algorithms in controlling challenging dynamical systems like the chaotic Lorenz-63 system.

- Shows importance of isometric and isomorphic constraints on the learned latent space geometry.

In summary, the paper provides a principled way to perform optimal control in unknown dynamical systems by discovering and operating in an equivariant latent geometry, with strong theoretical guarantees.
