 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Koopman Embed to Equivariant Control (KEEC) for performing optimal control of complex nonlinear dynamical systems without relying on explicit models of the systems. The core idea is to utilize Koopman operator theory to learn an embedding that maps the nonlinear system manifold to an equivariant geometry on which control tasks can be effectively solved. Specifically, KEEC first learns a diffeomorphic Koopman embedding that preserves key geometric properties like distances and vector fields. This allows transforming the original control problem into an equivalent problem on the latent equivariant geometry. Then, KEEC formulates an equivariant value function and derives analytical optimal actions on this value function, achieving quadratic convergence. Through experiments on challenging control tasks like pendulum swing-up and Lorenz-63 stabilization, KEEC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms. The results highlight the significance of discovering symmetric, equivariant representations and utilizing differential geometric information for complex optimal control problems.
