# Explaining Answers with Entailment Trees

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we enable machines to generate richer, more systematic explanations for their question answering responses, specifically by generating explanations in the form of multi-step entailment trees?The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:1) Formulating explanation as multi-step, multi-premise textual entailment, where an entailment tree shows the reasoning from facts to conclusions leading to the final answer.2) Creating the EntailmentBank dataset, which contains 1,840 multi-step entailment trees annotated by experts to accompany QA pairs. This is the first dataset of its kind for multi-step entailments.3) Defining three hierarchical task formulations of increasing difficulty for generating entailment tree explanations.4) Developing baseline EntailmentWriter models to generate entailment trees for the tasks, showing reasonable performance when all relevant facts are provided, indicating feasibility.5) Analysis of the models and dataset, including common errors, limitations, and future directions. So in summary, the key research question is how to generate richer entailment tree explanations for QA, which they explore through a new dataset, task formulations, models, and analyses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Formulating explanation as multi-step, multi-premise textual entailment. 2. Introducing EntailmentBank, the first dataset of multi-step entailment trees for QA, to support entailment-based explanation. The dataset contains 1,840 trees with an average of 6.6 nodes and 2.7 entailment steps per tree.3. Defining three tasks of increasing difficulty for generating entailment tree explanations, based on the inputs provided: gold leaf sentences only (Task 1), gold leaves + distractor sentences (Task 2), or a full corpus (Task 3).4. Presenting baseline results using a T5-based generative model, showing it can partially solve the tasks, especially when provided with gold leaf sentences. For Task 1, 35% of generated trees perfectly matched the gold.5. Providing analysis of errors and future directions, including modifications to the loss function, applying constraints during generation, and improving evaluation to account for valid tree variations.  6. Demonstrating potential for generalization by evaluating on out-of-domain QA datasets, where models trained on EntailmentBank could produce valid explanations without retraining.In summary, the key contribution is providing a new dataset for richer, multi-step reasoning chains as explanations, along with baseline methods and analysis, opening up new research directions for generating more systematic and interpretable explanations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces EntailmentBank, the first dataset of multi-step entailment trees for explaining question answering, and presents baseline results showing that large language models can partially generate valid trees, especially when provided with relevant facts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces a new dataset called EntailmentBank, which contains multi-step entailment trees for explaining question-answering pairs. This is the first dataset of its kind to contain detailed, structured explanations in the form of entailment trees. Other datasets like eSNLI and WiC provide some explanatory sentences, but not full reasoning chains.- The paper proposes formulating explanation as multi-step, multi-premise textual entailment. This represents a more structured and decomposed notion of explanation compared to just extracting rationales or highlighting supporting evidence. - The authors develop baseline models called EntailmentWriters for generating entailment tree explanations. The models are able to generate valid explanations, especially when provided with relevant facts. This shows the promise of textual entailment for more systematic reasoning. Other work has focused more on extracting explanations.- Experiments are conducted on science QA, but the authors also show some generalization of EntailmentWriters to other domains. Other datasets like eQASC and WorldTree are primarily focused on science QA.- The paper aims to generate full derivations, assessing correctness. Other work has focused more on the pragmatics of selecting good explanations for users. This work could enable future research on explanation pragmatics.In summary, the key novelties are the EntailmentBank dataset containing structured reasoning chains, the formulation of explanation as entailment trees, and baseline EntailmentWriter models that can generate valid trees. This represents a new direction for producing more systematic, decomposable explanations.
