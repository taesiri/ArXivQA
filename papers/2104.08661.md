# [Explaining Answers with Entailment Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08661)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we enable machines to generate richer, more systematic explanations for their question answering responses, specifically by generating explanations in the form of multi-step entailment trees?The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:1) Formulating explanation as multi-step, multi-premise textual entailment, where an entailment tree shows the reasoning from facts to conclusions leading to the final answer.2) Creating the EntailmentBank dataset, which contains 1,840 multi-step entailment trees annotated by experts to accompany QA pairs. This is the first dataset of its kind for multi-step entailments.3) Defining three hierarchical task formulations of increasing difficulty for generating entailment tree explanations.4) Developing baseline EntailmentWriter models to generate entailment trees for the tasks, showing reasonable performance when all relevant facts are provided, indicating feasibility.5) Analysis of the models and dataset, including common errors, limitations, and future directions. So in summary, the key research question is how to generate richer entailment tree explanations for QA, which they explore through a new dataset, task formulations, models, and analyses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Formulating explanation as multi-step, multi-premise textual entailment. 2. Introducing EntailmentBank, the first dataset of multi-step entailment trees for QA, to support entailment-based explanation. The dataset contains 1,840 trees with an average of 6.6 nodes and 2.7 entailment steps per tree.3. Defining three tasks of increasing difficulty for generating entailment tree explanations, based on the inputs provided: gold leaf sentences only (Task 1), gold leaves + distractor sentences (Task 2), or a full corpus (Task 3).4. Presenting baseline results using a T5-based generative model, showing it can partially solve the tasks, especially when provided with gold leaf sentences. For Task 1, 35% of generated trees perfectly matched the gold.5. Providing analysis of errors and future directions, including modifications to the loss function, applying constraints during generation, and improving evaluation to account for valid tree variations.  6. Demonstrating potential for generalization by evaluating on out-of-domain QA datasets, where models trained on EntailmentBank could produce valid explanations without retraining.In summary, the key contribution is providing a new dataset for richer, multi-step reasoning chains as explanations, along with baseline methods and analysis, opening up new research directions for generating more systematic and interpretable explanations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces EntailmentBank, the first dataset of multi-step entailment trees for explaining question answering, and presents baseline results showing that large language models can partially generate valid trees, especially when provided with relevant facts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces a new dataset called EntailmentBank, which contains multi-step entailment trees for explaining question-answering pairs. This is the first dataset of its kind to contain detailed, structured explanations in the form of entailment trees. Other datasets like eSNLI and WiC provide some explanatory sentences, but not full reasoning chains.- The paper proposes formulating explanation as multi-step, multi-premise textual entailment. This represents a more structured and decomposed notion of explanation compared to just extracting rationales or highlighting supporting evidence. - The authors develop baseline models called EntailmentWriters for generating entailment tree explanations. The models are able to generate valid explanations, especially when provided with relevant facts. This shows the promise of textual entailment for more systematic reasoning. Other work has focused more on extracting explanations.- Experiments are conducted on science QA, but the authors also show some generalization of EntailmentWriters to other domains. Other datasets like eQASC and WorldTree are primarily focused on science QA.- The paper aims to generate full derivations, assessing correctness. Other work has focused more on the pragmatics of selecting good explanations for users. This work could enable future research on explanation pragmatics.In summary, the key novelties are the EntailmentBank dataset containing structured reasoning chains, the formulation of explanation as entailment trees, and baseline EntailmentWriter models that can generate valid trees. This represents a new direction for producing more systematic, decomposable explanations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests several potential future research directions:1. Modify the loss function to encourage the model to generate novel intermediate conclusions, rather than just repeating input sentences. The analysis showed the model has a tendency to simply repeat inputs.2. Explore an iterative approach to entailment tree generation, where the model focuses on generating one entailment step at a time. This may make individual entailment steps easier.3. Add an entailment validation module to check the validity of each generated entailment step. This could help avoid invalid steps. 4. Add a goal-directed term to the loss function to encourage intermediate nodes that are relevant to proving the final hypothesis. This may reduce irrelevant nodes.5. Apply structural constraints during tree generation to enforce a coherent tree structure and avoid disconnected subtrees.6. Improve the evaluation metric to be more robust to valid alternate tree structures. The analysis showed the metric sometimes gives low scores to valid alternate trees. 7. Investigate better strategies for retrieving relevant sentences from a corpus, as this was shown to be a bottleneck in the full task. Alternatively, allow models to generate relevant sentences rather than just retrieve them.8. Apply fact verification techniques to validate generated facts, allowing interactive re-generation of explanations when needed.9. Explore interactive explanation generation, where models generate one step at a time based on user feedback.So in summary, the key suggestions are around improving entailment quality, enforcing tree structure, more robust evaluation, better retrieval/generation of facts, and interactivity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main points in the paper:The paper presents the EntailmentBank dataset, the first dataset of multi-step entailment trees for question-answering. The dataset contains 1,840 entailment trees showing the reasoning from facts to answers for science exam questions. On average, each tree contains 7.6 nodes across 3.2 entailment steps. The paper also defines three tasks of generating entailment trees given the question and answer plus (1) only the relevant facts, (2) relevant facts plus distractors, or (3) a full corpus. Baseline models using T5 are presented, which can generate valid trees especially when given the relevant facts, but performance decreases as more distracting information is added. The paper shows promising results on explaining answers with multi-step entailment trees, and the release of the dataset enables further research in this direction. Overall, the work makes contributions in formulating explanation as entailment trees, releasing the first multi-step entailment dataset, and establishing baseline results on entailment tree generation tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents the EntailmentBank dataset, the first dataset containing multi-step entailment trees that show detailed reasoning chains explaining question-answer pairs. The authors created the dataset by having experts annotate entailment trees showing chains of reasoning from sentences to hypotheses summarizing question-answer pairs from science exam questions. The trees contain an average of 6.6 nodes across 3.2 entailment steps, with trees ranging from simple 1-2 step inferences to complex multi-step reasoning chains. The paper also presents baseline results on generating the entailment trees from the dataset using a T5 model adapted for this task. They define three tasks of increasing difficulty, providing the model just the relevant facts, relevant + distractor facts, or the full corpus as input. The model is able to generate valid trees reasonably well when provided just the relevant facts, with around 35% perfect trees, but performance degrades as irrelevant facts and corpus search is added. The paper analyzes the errors, suggesting improvements to the modeling approach. Overall, the EntailmentBank dataset enables developing rich reasoning chain explanations, providing a valuable resource and results towards this goal.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a new approach for generating explanations for question answering systems in the form of multi-step entailment trees. To enable training models for this task, the authors created a new dataset called EntailmentBank, which contains 1,840 entailment trees showing the reasoning steps from facts to answers for elementary science exam questions. Each tree contains an average of 7.6 facts connected across 3.2 entailment steps. To generate the trees, the authors developed a web-based annotation tool to assist experts in incrementally constructing trees starting from leaf facts. Using this dataset, the authors trained T5 transformer models called EntailmentWriters on three tasks of increasing difficulty: generating a tree given (1) all leaf facts, (2) leaf facts plus distractors, and (3) only a corpus. Results show the model is able to generate valid trees, especially when provided the leaf facts. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of entailment tree generation and provides analysis of remaining challenges. Overall, it introduces a novel approach for developing richer, more interpretable question answering systems.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the challenge of generating explanations for question answering systems that show the reasoning or inference steps from the evidence to the answer, rather than just highlighting snippets of evidence. Specifically, it aims to generate "entailment trees" that lay out the reasoning in a structured, multi-step format.The key problems and questions the paper addresses are:- How can reasoning chains or inferences be represented as structured explanations (using entailment trees) rather than just evidence snippets?- How can multi-step inference explanations be generated automatically from a question, evidence sentences, and answer?- What kind of training data is needed for developing and evaluating this capability? The paper introduces the first dataset of multi-step entailment trees for this purpose.- What are effective baseline methods for generating entailment tree explanations, and how well do they perform on this new dataset and task? The paper proposes and evaluates neural network models for this.- To what extent can models trained on this dataset generalize to other domains? The paper includes some initial out-of-domain experiments.Overall, the paper frames the problem of generating structured, multi-step reasoning chains as explanations, provides a new dataset to facilitate research in this area, and develops baseline models to show the promise of this approach. The key innovation is moving beyond evidence snippets to full entailment trees that explicate the reasoning.
