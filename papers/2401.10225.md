# [ChatQA: Building GPT-4 Level Conversational QA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces ChatQA, a family of conversational question answering models built using large language models (LLMs). The goal is to achieve accuracies on par with the recently released GPT-4 model from OpenAI on conversational QA tasks, without relying on any synthetic data from GPT models. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

1) A two-stage instruction tuning method to significantly enhance LLM's capability to effectively integrate retrieved or provided context for zero-shot conversational QA. This outperforms regular instruction tuning methods.

2) For retrieval in conversational QA, fine-tuning a dense retriever on a multi-turn QA dataset provides comparable performance to the state-of-the-art query rewriting technique that uses GPT-3.5-turbo. But the fine-tuning approach reduces deployment cost.

3) Careful curation of a human-annotated conversational QA dataset, as well as a technique to construct unanswerable cases that reduces the model's tendency to hallucinate answers.

4) Comprehensive evaluations across 10 diverse conversational QA datasets, including 5 that require retrieval from long documents and 3 that contain tables. The best ChatQA-70B model achieves an average score of 54.14 across these datasets, slightly outperforming GPT-4 at 53.90.

5) Analysis of unanswerable cases shows the model can discern when an answer is unavailable in the context over 70% of the time. This is much higher than GPT-3.5-turbo, although still has a small gap compared to GPT-4.

In summary, this paper demonstrates techniques to build accurate and robust conversational QA models comparable to the recent ChatGPT agent, without reliance on any private training data. The models show strong performance across diverse domains and document formats.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces ChatQA, a family of conversational question answering models built using a two-stage instruction tuning method and an enhanced retriever. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance on 10 conversational QA datasets without relying on synthetic data from ChatGPT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a two-stage instruction tuning method to build conversational QA models (ChatQA) that can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI's models. 

2. It shows that fine-tuning a dense retriever on multi-turn QA data performs comparably to using a state-of-the-art query rewriting model for retrieval in conversational QA, while reducing deployment cost.

3. It builds a family of ChatQA models based on LLMs of varying sizes. The best ChatQA-70B model slightly outperforms GPT-4 on an average score over 10 conversational QA datasets.

4. It studies the "unanswerable" scenario where answers are unavailable in the context, and shows adding a small amount of such samples in instruction tuning can reduce hallucination. ChatQA-70B outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo in this regard.

In summary, the paper makes significant progress towards building open conversational QA models that can match proprietary models like GPT-4 in terms of accuracy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage instruction tuning framework for building conversational QA models. Can you elaborate on why a two-stage approach is more effective than doing just one stage of instruction tuning? What are the limitations of only doing stage-1 or only doing stage-2?

2. The stage-2 instruction tuning uses both single-turn and conversational QA datasets. What is the rationale behind mixing both types of QA data? Does using single-turn QA data help improve the multi-turn QA capability of the model?

3. For retrieval in conversational QA, the paper shows that fine-tuning a retriever with conversational query/context pairs works well. Why does this approach perform better than query rewriting? What are the tradeoffs between fine-tuning vs rewriting for this task?  

4. The paper emphasizes the importance of using human-annotated data over synthetic data from LLMs. However, the results show that both data sources lead to comparable performance. How do you explain this? In what aspects does the human-annotated data show advantages over synthetic data?

5. The unanswerable evaluation reveals that adding a small amount of unanswerable cases significantly reduces hallucination. However, too many unanswerable cases lead to degraded QA quality on answerable cases. What could be the reasons? How can we find the right balance?

6. The paper studies the effect of using top-k retrieved chunks as context during stage-2 instruction tuning. The results show that it improves retrieval datasets but hurts non-retrieval datasets. What causes this performance drop? How can this train/test mismatch issue be further addressed? 

7. The human evaluation result shows that the proposed ChatQA-70B model matches GPT-4 in terms of tie rate. But GPT-4 has a bit higher win rate. What are the possible reasons that could explain GPT-4's better performance?  

8. The fine-grained analysis reveals that ChatQA-70B surpasses GPT-4 on text-only documents but falls behind on tabular documents. What capabilities need to be strengthened for ChatQA models to match GPT-4's mastery on table comprehension and reasoning?

9. The paper demonstrates building white-box conversational QA models that can match or surpass GPT-4 without relying on any private synthetic data. Do you foresee this paradigm continuing as larger models continue to advance in capability? What are the eventual limits of this approach?

10. The current human evaluation is limited in scale and does not assess dialog coherence or user experience. How would you design a more comprehensive human evaluation methodology to deeply evaluate and compare conversational agents like ChatQA and chatbots like ChatGPT?
