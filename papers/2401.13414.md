# [GTAutoAct: An Automatic Datasets Generation Framework Based on Game   Engine Redevelopment for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing datasets for action recognition have several key limitations: 
1) Constrained range of action classes, lacking diversity
2) Absence of multi-viewpoint recordings of actions
3) Limited diversity in environments, characters, etc. 
4) Poor video quality in some datasets
5) Manual collection is labor-intensive

Proposed Solution - GTAutoAct Framework:
The authors propose GTAutoAct, an innovative framework to automatically generate large-scale, diverse and high-quality datasets for action recognition using game engine technology. The key capabilities and contributions include:

1) A new rotation-based 3D human motion representation system that is more suitable for diverse characters, enables intuitive manipulation, adds realistic constraints, and simplifies interpolation

2) An algorithm to dynamically segment motion sequences, automatically interpolate frames to ensure smoothness, and randomly generate variants to increase diversity

3) Extensive customizability of animation scenes - environments, characters, landscapes, etc.

4) An automated pipeline to capture videos from random viewpoints, with auto-trimming and labeling functions

Experiments and Results:
Experiments were conducted to evaluate how datasets generated by GTAutoAct can help bridge the gap between synthetic and real datasets. Human motion representations were tested for both whole-body and major-body parts. 

The results demonstrate GTAutoAct's strong capabilities in multi-viewpoint data generation and frame interpolation. For example, using only 6% of the frames from an original dataset, GTAutoAct generated superior multi-viewpoint data that helped surpass the original dataset's accuracy. This highlights the potential for significant improvements in action recognition using GTAutoAct.

In summary, GTAutoAct is a novel framework to automatically create diverse, realistic and well-annotated large-scale datasets to advance action recognition using game engine technologies. The experiments validate its ability to enhance model training.
