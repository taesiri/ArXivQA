# [Improving Open Language Models by Learning from Organic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04707)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we improve open domain conversational models by learning from real-world organic interactions and feedback data?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

By collecting and learning from organic user interactions and feedback in a public deployment, conversational models can be improved in terms of both conversational quality and safety.

The paper details the analysis of a large dataset of organic user interactions with the BlenderBot 3 conversational agent. It studies techniques to leverage this data, including human feedback signals like thumbs up/down, to improve the model. The main contributions appear to be:

1) Analysis of a large dataset of organic user interactions with BlenderBot 3. This includes over 350k conversations and over 6M utterances.

2) Development of a reward model to label conversational responses as good or bad using the organic feedback data.

3) Experiments with different techniques like the Cringe Loss to improve conversational quality and safety from the organic interaction data.

4) Introduction of the BlenderBot 3x model, which outperforms BlenderBot 3 in terms of response quality and safety when evaluated on the organic user data.

5) Release of the organic interaction dataset to spur further research.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that conversational models can be improved by collecting and learning from organic user interactions, which the paper tests through analysis, model training experiments, and human evaluations. The release of the dataset also aims to enable further research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Analyzing organic interaction and feedback data collected from the public BlenderBot 3 deployment. This consists of over 350k conversations with over 6M utterances and 155k feedback responses. The authors provide detailed analysis on the quality of human and model utterances, as well as the quality of the organic feedback. 

2. Developing techniques to learn improved dialogue models from this organic interaction data, using a trained reward model to provide signals for good and bad responses. In particular, they utilize the Cringe loss to reduce bad responses while increasing good ones.

3. Demonstrating improved results with their BlenderBot 3x model, which is trained on the organic interaction data. In human evaluations, BlenderBot 3x produces better and safer responses compared to the original BlenderBot 3 model.

4. Publicly releasing the collected organic interaction data to spur further research and progress in this area by the broader research community.

In summary, the core contribution is showing how organic interactions from real users can be leveraged in a responsible manner to incrementally improve dialogue models over time, both in terms of conversational quality and safety. The public data release also enables further research in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents BlenderBot 3x, an improved conversational AI model trained on crowdsourced data as well as organic user interactions from the BlenderBot 3 deployment, with techniques to learn from helpful teachers while avoiding adversarial inputs; BlenderBot 3x is shown to produce better and safer responses compared to its predecessor BlenderBot 3.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper focuses on improving open dialogue models by learning from organic user interactions and feedback data collected during deployment of the BlenderBot 3 system. This is a novel approach compared to most prior work that relies on more controlled crowdsourced datasets for training. 

- The concept of deploying dialogue systems to real users and learning from that interaction data has been explored before (e.g. in the LIGHT system), but not at the scale of hundreds of thousands of conversations as done here. The release of this large organic dialogue dataset is an important contribution.

- The paper explores techniques like the Cringe loss to effectively learn from both positive and negative examples in the organic data. This compares favorably to prior work that mainly uses standard supervised learning on crowdsourced data.

- For improving safety, the paper studies approaches like the baked-in safety method and balancing positive and negative examples. This contrasts with much prior work that focuses solely on crowdsourced adversarial safety datasets which may not cover real user distributions.

- The focus on iterative learning over multiple rounds of deployment data collection and model retraining is more advanced than prior one-off supervised learning approaches. This methodology is critical for continually improving models based on user feedback.

- Comparisons are made to other large conversational models like BlenderBot 3 and LaMDA. The improvements from fine-tuning on deployment data demonstrate the value of this technique versus just scaling up model size.

Overall, the rigorous methodology and experiments on real-world data advance the state-of-the-art in building better open dialogue models through human-in-the-loop interaction. The public data release also enables the wider research community to build on this work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising future research directions:

1) Further evaluating and improving techniques for learning from human interaction and feedback data in real organic deployments. While the authors show promising results with the Cringe loss, more methods could be developed and compared on the released organic interaction datasets.

2) Exploring new community-based deployments that encourage helpful feedback from users beyond just likes/dislikes. The authors propose that more expert feedback, explanations, and suggestions could be very beneficial for improving models. Fostering positive community engagement could help enable this.

3) Developing better reward models that accurately reflect human preferences. The authors note limitations of their reward model, so improving these could lead to better learning. This includes better handling of noisy/adversarial feedback.

4) Continuing to improve safety and appropriateness of model responses, especially in challenging adversarial situations. The authors made progress but note there is room for improvement still.

5) Exploring different base model architectures beyond OPT-175B. Comparisons to LLMs like LLaMA indicate better pre-training procedures could also help.

6) Releasing more and higher quality annotated datasets to the community. The authors released organic data but note more curated data could enable better techniques.

In summary, the main suggestions are to build on their approach for learning from organic deployment data, explore new community-based paradigms for model improvement, develop better training techniques and reward models, continue improving safety, try new model architectures, and release more high-quality datasets. The overarching goal is developing open models that improve perpetually via online human interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an update to the conversational model BlenderBot 3 called BlenderBot 3x, which is trained on organic conversation and feedback data collected from users interacting with the deployed BlenderBot 3 system. The goal is to improve the model's conversational skills and safety using real-world data. The authors analyze over 350,000 conversations containing 6.2 million utterances collected during the BlenderBot 3 deployment. They find the data contains both high quality and adversarial conversations. Using crowdworkers, they label subsets of the data to train a reward model to identify good and bad responses. They then use techniques like Cringe Loss to train improved models using the organic data and reward model labels. Their best model BlenderBot 3x outperforms BlenderBot 3 in evaluations, producing safer and more engaging responses. The de-identified interaction data is released to spur further research. Overall, the work demonstrates learning from organic deployments can improve skills and safety, but adversarial users pose challenges.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper describes BlenderBot 3x, an updated conversational model based on BlenderBot 3, which learns from organic user interactions and feedback. BlenderBot 3x utilizes over 353,000 conversations with 6.2 million utterances collected from the public deployment of BlenderBot 3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of this organic data, employing crowdworkers to evaluate the quality of human and model messages. About 70% of conversations are reciprocal and on-topic, while 30% are adversarial or toxic. In standard conversations, humans produce high quality messages 75% of the time, while the model is high quality 85% of the time. In adversarial conversations, humans are only high quality 45% of the time, while the model is still relatively robust at 77%. The model generates inappropriate responses 0.6% of the time in standard conversations and 2.4% of the time in adversarial ones. 

The paper trains a reward model using crowdworker annotations and organic feedback to label utterances as good or bad. This is used with Cringe Loss to train the model to generate good responses while avoiding bad ones. The resulting BlenderBot 3x model outperforms BlenderBot 3 according to human evaluations, producing fewer inappropriate, nonsensical, or off-topic responses. BlenderBot 3x is both preferred in conversation and shown to be safer than BlenderBot 3. The anonymous interaction data is publicly released to advance research into learning from organic deployment. While current models still have issues, the techniques explored aim to improve models through continued learning from real-world use.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores learning to improve conversational AI models through interactions with real users. It utilizes the previously released BlenderBot 3 model, which was deployed publicly to engage in conversations with people. During these conversations, users could provide feedback by clicking thumbs up or down to rate model responses. The authors collect and analyze over 350,000 conversations containing this feedback. They find both high quality reciprocal conversations, as well as adversarial interactions trying to trick the model. To learn from this data, they first crowd-source annotations of conversation quality to train a reward model to label dialogue turns as good or bad automatically. They then fine-tune the BlenderBot 3 model using the Cringe loss technique, which encourages generating probable responses while discouraging unlikely negative responses labeled by the reward model. After iterative training, the resulting BlenderBot 3x model is shown to produce better responses on average during conversations with people, including safer behavior, compared to the original BlenderBot 3 baseline.
