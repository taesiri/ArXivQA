# [Large-Scale Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning via Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), which aims to find efficient paths for multiple robots to completely cover a given terrain. The terrain is represented as a 2D grid graph, with vertices representing locations and edges representing traversibility between locations. The objective is to minimize the makespan (the maximum path cost of any robot), while ensuring complete coverage. This problem is challenging, especially for large-scale scenarios with many robots and terrain vertices. 

Existing approaches decompose the terrain into trees, with a tree rooted on each robot. They then derive coverage paths by circumnavigating the trees. However, this has limitations as it operates only on complete graphs and cannot guarantee optimality.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a new algorithm called LS-MCPP that takes a different approach of directly searching for good coverage paths on the decomposed graph. The key ideas are:

1) It proposes a new Extended-STC paradigm that extends the existing Spanning Tree Coverage approach to work on both complete and incomplete graphs, guaranteeing complete coverage. 

2) It introduces three types of boundary editing operators - grow, deduplicate, and exchange operators - that strategically modify the boundary vertices assigned to each robot's subgraph. This allows efficiently exploring the search space.

3) It employs these operators within a local search framework, using heuristics and forced deduplication to converge to a balanced solution.


Main Contributions:
- Extended-STC: A generalized standalone paradigm for coverage path planning on decomposed graphs
- Novel boundary editing operators tailored for effective local search 
- LS-MCPP algorithm combining the above ideas to directly search for MCPP solutions 
- Experiments showing LS-MCPP reducing makespan substantially compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrated scalability in handling large real-world benchmarks with 10,000s of vertices and dozens of robots

The main impact is a new way of addressing MCPP that works directly on decomposed graphs instead of operating exclusively on terrain graphs. This shows great promise in efficiently handling large-scale coverage planning problems.
