# [Towards Sample-specific Backdoor Attack with Clean Labels via Attribute   Trigger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper revisits sample-specific backdoor attacks (SSBAs), which are currently the most advanced attack methods since they can bypass most defenses. However, existing SSBAs have poisoned labels, so users can detect anomalies by checking image-label relationships. Directly extending SSBAs to clean-label variants (only poisoning target class samples) fails, due to the difficulty in learning mild sample-specific triggers amidst strong target class features.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes exploiting human-interpretable attributes as triggers to design the first clean-label SSBA called BAAT (Backdoor Attack with Attribute Trigger). Attributes allow higher trigger intensities while preserving stealthiness. A pre-trained attribute editor modifies selected target class images to have an adversary-specified rare attribute. This forces models to rely on the attribute trigger over real target class features to predict the label.

Main Contributions:
1) Demonstrates limitations of both existing sample-specific and clean-label backdoor attacks.

2) Reveals reasons for failure to directly extend SSBAs to clean-label setting - due to `antagonistic effects' of target class features and difficulty learning mild sample-specific triggers.

3) Proposes BAAT - first clean-label SSBA using human-interpretable attributes as triggers, which allows higher trigger intensities while preserving stealthiness.

4) Empirically verifies BAAT's effectiveness and robustness against representative defenses on benchmark datasets.

The key insight is that attribute triggers better match human perception, allowing higher intensities that overpower target class features, enabling the first successful clean-label SSBA. By revealing limitations of prior arts and proposing an effective new attack, this paper facilitates more robust model defense designs.
