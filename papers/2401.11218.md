# [End-to-End Argument Mining over Varying Rhetorical Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Argument mining aims to identify premises, claims and conclusions in argumentative text. Discourse parsing aims to identify rhetorical relations between discourse units. 
- Previous work has examined the relationship between rhetorical and argument structures using a single rhetorical parsing result per text. 
- However, the same argument structure can occur in similar texts with different rhetorical structures, especially given the ambiguity of discourse and limitations of rhetorical parsers.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a neural model called Discourse-driven Biaffine Parser (DBAP) to assess the connection between rhetorical and argument structures. 
- It utilizes multiple rhetorical structures of paraphrases of the same argumentative text as training data augmentations.
- Rhetorical relations from predicted RST trees are incorporated as features into a biaffine dependency parser to predict argument structures.

Experiments:
- Experiments conducted on the Argumentative Microtexts corpus in English and Russian.
- Paraphrases obtained via semi-automated back translation over parallel corpus. 
- Analysis shows high variability in predicted rhetorical structures of paraphrases.
- DBAP outperforms baseline on argument parsing when using predicted RST structures.

Contributions:
- First end-to-end argument parser trained on Argumentative Microtexts corpus.
- First application utilizing multiple versions of rhetorical structures to analyze discourse-argument relationship. 
- First results reported on full argument mining for Russian version of Microtexts corpus.
- Analysis and results suggest argument mining can benefit from multiple discourse structure variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a neural model to analyze the connection between rhetorical and argument structures in short texts by using multiple predicted rhetorical structure variants of the same arguments as training data augmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a neural model called Discourse-driven Biaffine Parser (DBAP) that utilizes rhetorical relations from predicted rhetorical structure trees to help with argument mining. Specifically:

- They collect multiple rhetorical structure variants for short argumentative texts by using back translation to paraphrase the texts. This allows them to analyze how discourse variation affects argument mining.

- They propose the DBAP model that incorporates rhetorical relations as features to help predict argumentative structure. This is a type of multi-task learning approach.

- They evaluate DBAP on the English and Russian versions of the Argumentative Microtexts corpus. They show that using multiple rhetorical structure variants can improve performance of argument mining with the DBAP model.

- This is the first end-to-end neural argument parser evaluated on the Microtexts corpus. It is also the first application using multiple rhetorical structure variants to analyze the relationship between discourse and argumentation.

So in summary, the main contribution is using multiple discourse structure representations, along with a new neural model, to improve argument mining on short argumentative texts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Argument mining - automatically identifying premises, claims, and conclusions in an argument
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) - a theory for describing discourse structure of texts
- Discourse parsing - identifying rhetorical/discourse relations between parts of a text 
- Evidence graphs - graph representation of argument structure with nodes as propositions and edges indicating support/attack
- Argumentative Microtexts corpus - a corpus of short argumentative texts
- Biaffine dependency parsing - the parsing method used for argument mining
- Discourse variation - the same argument structure can have different valid rhetorical structures
- Back translation - paraphrasing by round-trip translation 
- Data augmentation - using additional rephrased versions of texts to expand training data
- End-to-end argument mining - jointly performing segmentation and parsing rather than assuming gold standard segments
- Multilinguality - applying approaches to both English and Russian texts
- Rhetorical relations - relations like Elaboration, Contrast, Cause, Condition that connect text spans
- Nuclearity - the nucleus and satellite roles assigned in RST relations

The key goals of the paper are exploring the benefit of rhetorical structure for end-to-end argument mining and using multiple discourse variations of the same arguments to improve performance. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that the same argumentative structure can exist in texts with different rhetorical structures. Why is analyzing multiple rhetorical structure variants of the same text important for assessing the relationship between discourse and argumentation?

2. The paper uses semi-automated back translation to generate paraphrases and rhetorical structure variations. What are the benefits and potential limitations of using machine translation instead of manual paraphrasing? 

3. The Discourse-driven Biaffine Argument Parser (DBAP) incorporates predicted rhetorical relations into the scoring function for argumentative dependencies. Explain in detail how the discourse coefficients are computed and incorporated.

4. The paper analyzes the learned discourse coefficients by rhetorical relation type. Summarize the main trends and categories identified from the coefficient statistics. What insights do these provide about the argumentativeness of different relations?

5. For the task of joint segmentation and parsing, “same-arg” functions are assigned to intra-ADU relations to preserve discourse structure. Explain this design choice and its implications on the argument tree representation.

6. Error analysis reveals differences in nuclearity interpretation between the English and Russian RST parsers. How do these differences impact the utility of rhetorical structures for argument mining in each language?

7. The results show lower performance gains from discourse features in the Russian experiments. What factors could explain this result? How might the Russian rhetorical parser be improved?

8. The paper focuses only on short, fully argumentative texts from the Microtexts corpus. Discuss challenges and required adaptations for applying DBAP to longer, real-world argumentation with non-argumentative discourse. 

9. The model improvements rely on accurate rhetorical parsing. How robust is DBAP to rhetorical parsing errors? What could make it more robust? Are there alternative sources of discourse information?

10. The paper aims to estimate the utility of rhetorical structures for argument mining. Do you think the method and analyses successfully assess this? What additional experiments could provide further insight?
