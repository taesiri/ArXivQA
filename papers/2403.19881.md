# [IME: Integrating Multi-curvature Shared and Specific Embedding for   Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) capture the evolution of knowledge over time, but suffer from incompleteness. 
- TKGs have complex geometric structures (rings, trees, chains) that are best modeled in different curvature spaces (hyperspherical, hyperbolic, Euclidean).
- Existing methods use a single space or don't handle gaps between multi-curvature spaces well.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new model called Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding (IME) for temporal knowledge graph completion.
- Represents TKG in all 3 curvature spaces, uses a quadruplet distributor in each space to aggregate info between entities, relations and timestamps.  
- Learns two key properties:
   - Space-shared: Captures commonalities across spaces, reduces gaps.
   - Space-specific: Captures unique characteristics of each curvature space.
- Uses a novel Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling technique to retain important information from these properties.

Main Contributions:
- First model to simultaneously learn space-shared and space-specific properties across multi-curvature embeddings.
- New adjustable pooling technique for retaining important information.
- Introduction of structure loss concept to ensure similarity of representations across different spaces.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance over previous TKGC methods on standard datasets.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to effectively model temporal knowledge graphs using multi-curvature embeddings and new properties/losses that outperforms prior state-of-the-art.
