# [Multimodal Large Language Models to Support Real-World Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03627)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Concerns are growing about the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reliably distinguish between factual and non-factual information. 
- Current evaluation methods for assessing the factuality of MLLMs are limited. They focus on simple cases like object hallucinations or study textual hallucinations which can be affected by many confounding factors.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes evaluating MLLMs by using them as fact-checkers on real-world multimodal claims that were manually checked by professional fact-checkers. This setup better captures the models' alignment with reality.

- Two multimodal datasets were created from scratch (M-MOCHEG, LATEST) using images and claims from fact-checking websites. Claims cover social and non-social topics from two time periods.

- Responses (predictions, explanations, confidence scores) are collected from multiple MLLMs including GPT-4V and open-source models by prompting them.

- The responses are comprehensively analyzed to benchmark performance and study the models' capabilities, deficiencies and reasons for failure.

Key Contributions:

- A novel, challenging and straightforward framework to evaluate the factual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs using real-world multimodal claims.

- Empirical analysis showing GPT-4V's superior performance in distinguishing factuality. It demonstrates good calibration and cross-lingual generalization.

- Taxonomy of reasons why GPT-4V fails, like lack of knowledge, recognition errors, reasoning gaps. This informs future research.

- Experiments showing open-source models are prone to compliance with input claims. Aligning multimodal knowledge and enhancing deception awareness are crucial.

- Analysis of feasibility of using GPT-4 to quantify GPT-4V's capabilities. Few-shot learning is shown to improve open-source models' performance.

- Two new datasets of manually fact-checked multimodal claims that can facilitate research on improving factuality of MLLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a realistic framework for evaluating the factual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models by using them as fact-checkers on real-world visual claims, and finds that GPT-4V demonstrates impressive performance while open-source models still fall behind due to weaknesses in knowledge, reasoning, and deception awareness that provide directions for further improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a novel framework for evaluating the factual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using a practical fact-checking setup with real-world check-worthy image and text claims. 

2. It benchmarks the performance of two MLLMs (GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.5) on distinguishing factual vs non-factual multimodal claims across four languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, and German).

3. It analyzes the quality of the generated explanations by the MLLMs, designs a taxonomy of reasons for errors, and manually classifies the errors to understand deficiencies.

4. It studies how calibrated the confidence scores provided by the MLLMs are in relation to the actual correctness of their predictions.

5. It performs ablation studies with different prompt variations and few-shot examples to analyze their impact.

6. It releases new datasets and annotations to facilitate further research in evaluating and improving the factuality of multimodal LLMs.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards assessing and enhancing the factuality of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs using a practical fact-checking setup and rigorous analysis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using real-world multimodal claims from fact-checking websites as a way to evaluate the factuality of large language models. What are some potential limitations or biases that could be introduced by relying solely on claims curated by fact-checking organizations? How might the methodology be adapted to include a more diverse range of claims?

2. When translating prompts and claims into other languages like Chinese and Arabic, what steps were taken to ensure the translations preserved the original meaning and details of each claim? How might subtle changes introduced in translation impact the models' understanding and evaluation?  

3. For the social and non-social claim distinction introduced in the datasets, what specific criteria were used to categorize claims into each group? Would an alternative categorization scheme, such as by broader topical areas, lead to additional insights?

4. In the analysis of model confidence, what threshold was used to determine whether a model's confidence aligned with the accuracy of its predictions? How might changing this threshold impact conclusions about model calibration?

5. The analysis focuses heavily on model explanations as a proxy for evaluating factuality. However, how do we know if the explanations themselves contain factual inaccuracies or hallucinations? What steps were taken to verify explanation quality?

6. When prompting models, how was the phrasing of questions constructed to avoid inserting researcher biases? What variations of phrasing and syntax were tested to ensure consistent question interpretation?  

7. For the few-shot learning experiments, what considerations dictated the selection of specific examples to provide as demonstrations for the LLaVA model? How might the choice of examples impact conclusions about few-shot benefits?

8. In translating claims into other languages, how was it ensured that Claims retained semantic equivalence? What quality checks were done on translations?

9. For multimodal claims without images, what differences in prediction accuracy would indicate whether a model distinguishes the absence of images? What benchmarks determine such distinction?

10. The analysis attributes better model performance primarily to improved model architecture in GPT-4V. However, how were model size and parameter counts controlled for to isolate the impact of architecture advances? Could larger model size alone account for some gains?
