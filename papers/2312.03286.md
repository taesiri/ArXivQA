# [Indirect Gradient Matching for Adversarial Robust Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03286)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adversarial distillation method called Indirect Gradient Distillation Module (IGDM) that transfers gradient information from a robust teacher model to a student model. Unlike most adversarial distillation techniques that focus on distilling the teacher's logits, IGDM leverages the inherent local linearity of adversarially trained models to indirectly align input gradients between the teacher and student. Through Taylor expansion approximations, IGDM matches differences in model outputs for perturbed inputs to implicitly match gradients, without needing to directly compute them. As gradient alignment improves, the student model becomes better at emulating the teacher's behavior pointwise. Experiments demonstrate IGDM's compatibility with existing adversarial training strategies, significantly boosting robustness across CIFAR datasets and model architectures. Key results include 30.32% AutoAttack accuracy on ResNet-18 and 29.52% on MobileNetV2 when combined with state-of-the-art techniques. The modular design also enables performance gains without expensive teacher model involvement during adversarial example generation. Overall, distilling gradient cues proves an effective way to transfer topological robustness knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Indirect Gradient Distillation Module that transfers gradient information from a robust teacher model to a student model by exploiting the locally linear property of adversarially trained models, improving adversarial robustness when integrated into existing adversarial training techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a methodology to transfer the gradient information from the teacher to the student model through exploiting the local linearity inherent in adversarial training. This is in contrast to most prior adversarial distillation methods that primarily concentrate on distilling the logits.

2) Based on the analysis, it proposes the Indirect Gradient Distillation Module (IGDM) which indirectly distills the gradient information. Its modular design allows easy integration into existing adversarial distillation methods. 

3) IGDM notably improves robustness across various attack scenarios. On CIFAR-100, it achieves 30.32% AutoAttack accuracy on ResNet-18 and 29.52% on MobileNetV2 when integrated into the state-of-the-art method. The module is also shown to be effective even without employing the teacher model in the inner maximization.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of IGDM which transfers gradient information from teacher to student to improve adversarial robustness, in contrast to existing works that focus on distilling logits. IGDM can complement existing methods and significantly boost robustness.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Indirect Gradient Matching for Adversarial Robust Distillation":

Problem:
- Adversarial attacks can fool deep learning models, raising concerns about their reliability in critical applications. Adversarial training improves robustness but works much better for large models compared to small ones.  

- Existing adversarial distillation (AD) methods transfer knowledge from a robust teacher to a student model to improve the robustness of small models. However, they primarily leverage the teacher's logits/outputs as guidance. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes to transfer another piece of teacher's knowledge - the input gradient - which is helpful for the student model's outer minimization in adversarial training.  

- It observes that adversarial training makes models locally linear, allowing first-order Taylor expansion. This enables indirect alignment of gradients without explicit calculations.

- It introduces the Indirect Gradient Distillation Module (IGDM) that matches input gradients by utilizing output differences and the adversarial perturbation from AD methods.

- As gradient matching aligns the linearized model behavior locally, it facilitates better point-wise mimicry of the robust teacher by the student.

- IGDM can flexibly integrate with existing AD methods as an extra loss term.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes to distill input gradient knowledge in addition to conventional output distillation in AD.

- Leverages locally linear property of adversarially trained models to indirectly match gradients via output differences.

- Introduces the Indirect Gradient Distillation Module (IGDM) that modularly integrates with AD methods.

- Shows IGDM consistently improves robustness across settings, achieving 30.32% on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-18 and 29.52% with MobileNetV2.

- Demonstrates IGDM's effectiveness even without involving the teacher in adversarial example generation, reducing training time.
