# [One-Shot Face Video Re-enactment using Hybrid Latent Spaces of StyleGAN2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: 

Can we learn a general model to facilitate face identity, attributes, and motion edits exploiting the latent spaces of StyleGAN2 without reliance on explicit 2D/3D facial structure models while improving the performance of generating realistic, high-quality, and temporally consistent one-shot face videos?

The key points are:

- The authors aim to develop a model for high-fidelity one-shot face video re-enactment that can control face identity, attributes, and motions purely based on StyleGAN2's latent spaces. 

- They want to avoid relying on explicit 2D or 3D facial structure priors (e.g. landmarks, parameterizations) which have limitations.

- The goal is to improve the realism, quality, and temporal consistency of generated face videos compared to prior work. 

- This will be achieved by learning to encode identity and facial deformations into StyleGAN2's latent spaces in a way that exploits their properties like editability and disentanglement.

So in summary, the core research question is whether they can exploit StyleGAN2's latent spaces to achieve state-of-the-art one-shot face video re-enactment without needing explicit facial structure priors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel end-to-end framework for high-fidelity one-shot face video re-enactment at 1024x1024 resolution, without relying on explicit 2D or 3D facial structure models. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- A framework that enables high-resolution robust one-shot face re-enactment (same and cross-identity) video generation at 1024x1024, as well as realistic facial edits like age, beard, makeup etc.

- A novel approach of combining two predefined latent spaces of StyleGAN2 ($W+$ and $SS$) to remove dependencies on explicit 2D or 3D facial structure priors like landmarks or parameterizations. 

- A new "Cyclic Manifold Adjustment" method that improves identity reconstruction of out-of-domain subjects and enables seamless transfer of facial deformations from the driving video to the source image.

- Simultaneous support for face attribute edits, facial motions/deformations, and facial identity control through the hybrid latent space encoding. 

In summary, the main contribution is a unified end-to-end framework that achieves state-of-the-art one-shot face reenactment by exploiting the editability and disentanglement properties of StyleGAN2's latent spaces, without relying on explicit facial structure models. This results in high-fidelity realistic videos and facial edits not achieved by prior work.
