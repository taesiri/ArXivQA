# [Semantic Sensitivities and Inconsistent Predictions: Measuring the   Fragility of NLI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent studies have suggested that transformer-based natural language understanding (NLU) models have an emergent understanding of semantics. However, this paper argues that these claims should be carefully examined, as state-of-the-art natural language inference (NLI) models are still sensitive to minor semantics-preserving surface-form variations, leading to inconsistent predictions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework to measure the extent of semantic sensitivity in NLI models. The key idea is to generate adversarial examples that contain minor semantics-preserving perturbations to the hypothesis in a premise-hypothesis pair. This is achieved via conditional text generation, with the constraint that the NLI model predicts the relationship between the original and adversarially generated pairs as a symmetric textual entailment. If the model then changes its prediction on the adversarially generated pair compared to the original, it demonstrates susceptibility to semantic sensitivity and inconsistency.

The framework has two main components: 
1) A module to generate semantics-preserving surface-form variations of hypotheses
2) Using the generated variations to measure semantic sensitivity and predictive inconsistency

The paper systematically studies semantic sensitivity across several state-of-the-art transformer models on MultiNLI (in-domain) and SNLI/ANLI (out-of-domain).

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of a novel framework to measure semantic sensitivity of NLI models to minor surface-form input variations
- Systematic study across models and datasets showing average performance degradations of 12.92% (in-domain) and 23.71% (out-of-domain) due to semantic sensitivity  
- Analysis of predictive distributions indicating significant shifts when semantics-preserving variations cause label changes
- Evidence that semantic sensitivity leads to major inconsistencies in model predictions despite strong overall performance

In summary, the paper demonstrates that existing NLI models still struggle with minor semantics-preserving perturbations, undermining claims of emergent semantic understanding capabilities. The proposed framework allows quantifying sensitivity and inconsistencies caused.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a framework to measure the fragility of natural language inference models by generating minor semantics-preserving variations of hypotheses, showing state-of-the-art models are sensitive to these variations and make inconsistent predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel framework for assessing semantic sensitivity in natural language inference (NLI) models. The framework involves generating semantics-preserving variations of hypotheses using conditional text generation, and then evaluating if NLI models can still recover the correct label when the original hypothesis is replaced with the variation.

2) Systematically studying the effects of semantic sensitivity across various transformer-based NLI models (e.g. RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, DistilBart) in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings using datasets like MNLI, SNLI and ANLI.

3) Showing through experiments that semantic sensitivity causes significant performance degradations (average 12.92% for in-domain and 23.71% for out-of-domain) and leads to major inconsistencies in model predictions.

4) Conducting ablation studies analyzing the phenomenon across models, datasets, label spaces, etc. to quantify the severity of inconsistent predictions caused by semantic sensitivities.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a way to measure fragility in NLI models with respect to semantics-preserving perturbations, and demonstrating that state-of-the-art models still struggle with minor surface form variations despite appearing highly accurate.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Natural Language Inference (NLI)
- Semantic sensitivity
- Inconsistent predictions 
- Surface-form variations
- Compositional semantics

- Language models (LMs)

- Logical relations
- Entailment relations
- Out-of-domain evaluation
- Adversarial evaluation

The paper proposes a framework to measure the semantic sensitivity of NLI models by generating semantics-preserving surface-form variations of hypotheses using conditional text generation. It then evaluates whether these minor variations cause inconsistent predictions in state-of-the-art NLI models across in-domain and out-of-domain settings. The key findings are that transformers exhibit high semantic sensitivity leading to sizable inconsistent predictions, indicating fragility despite strong accuracy. The analysis uses fooling rate metrics and studies prediction distribution shifts to quantify the extent of inconsistencies. Overall, the central theme is assessing semantic fragility and inconsistent predictions in NLI models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes generating semantics-preserving variations of the hypothesis in premise-hypothesis pairs. What is the motivation behind generating these variations rather than using the original hypotheses? How does this allow them to measure semantic sensitivity?

2. The paper uses a conditional text generation method to create the semantics-preserving variations. What is the advantage of using conditional generation over just paraphrasing the hypothesis? How does imposing the bidirectional entailment condition ensure that the generated variations preserve semantics?

3. The strict and relaxed fooling rates are used to quantify the semantic sensitivity of NLI models. What is the difference between these two metrics and why are both used in the analysis? What trends can be observed regarding these metrics across model sizes and domains?

4. The paper analyzes the distribution shifts between the predictions on the original hypotheses and the generated variations. What do the high Jensen-Shannon and Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence values indicate about the effect of semantic variations?  

5. One finding is that semantic sensitivity has a greater effect on predictions in out-of-domain settings compared to in-domain. Why might this be the case? What factors could contribute to the increased sensitivity when generalizing to other domains?

6. DistilBart is shown to struggle more with semantic variations compared to the BART model it is distilled from. What aspect of distillation could lead to this increased semantic sensitivity? How might this finding have implications for model compression techniques?

7. For samples that induce a label change, there is a noticeable drop in the standard deviation of predicted probabilities. What does this suggest about the models' behavior when predictions become inconsistent due to semantic noise?

8. The paper focuses on analyzing semantic sensitivity in Natural Language Inference. Could this evaluation framework be extended to other NLP tasks that rely on semantic understanding? What changes would need to be made?

9. One limitation raised is that only English language models are evaluated. How could this analysis be expanded to study multilingual models? What additional challenges might arise in generating semantics-preserving variations in other languages? 

10. Beyond analyzing model weaknesses, how could the insights from this semantic sensitivity evaluation be used to improve model robustness? Could the proposed method even be adapted into a semi-supervised training approach?
