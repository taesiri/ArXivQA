# [Hire a Linguist!: Learning Endangered Languages with In-Context   Linguistic Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Low-resource and endangered languages lack linguistic resources and annotated data, making it challenging for large language models (LLMs) to perform well on tasks in these languages. Tasks such as translation, discourse understanding, and text generation are especially difficult.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a method called Dict-LM to inject linguistic knowledge about low-resource languages into LLMs via dictionary-style prompts. 
- Dict-LM formulates prompts that provide definitions, translations, and descriptions about the morphology, phonology, syntax of the language. This linguistic knowledge is given to the LLM during inference.

Experiments:
- Dict-LM was evaluated on translation, response selection, math reasoning, word reordering, and keyword-to-text generation tasks across several endangered languages like Manchu, Gitksan, and Arapaho.
- Benchmarks were manually constructed or adapted for these languages and tasks. Performance was measured using metrics like spBLEU.

Results:
- Dict-LM significantly improved performance over baselines across all tasks. For GPT-4 translation, average spBLEU increased from 0.5 for zero-shot to 10.5 with Dict-LM.
- Dict-LM improved response selection accuracy by 20% absolute for Manchu and Arapaho. 75% of Manchu math questions were correctly solved.
- Performance was comparable to high-resource language inputs in some cases.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an effective prompting method Dict-LM to inject linguistic knowledge into LLMs for low-resource endangered languages, enabling various downstream tasks.
- Constructs new benchmarks and provides improvements across translation, understanding, reasoning, and generation in multiple languages.
- Achieves strong empirical results, demonstrating Dict-LM allows LLMs to perform well even with no training data in the language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method called DictioNLP that significantly improves the ability of large language models like GPT-4 and Mixtral to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks involving low-resource and endangered languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method called \method that significantly improves large language models' (LLMs) ability to understand and generate text in low-resource and endangered languages. Specifically:

- \method enables translation between endangered/low-resource languages like Manchu, Gitksan, Arapaho, etc. and high-resource languages like English and Spanish. It improves translation quality measured by spBLEU by 10.5 on average for GPT-4 and 5.9 for Mixtral-8B across 9 translation directions.

- It significantly improves LLMs' ability to understand discourse and select correct responses in endangered languages like Manchu, Gitksan and Arapaho. The accuracy is improved by 20% for Manchu and Arapaho using GPT-4, reaching within 6% of the upper bound.

- It improves performance on math reasoning, keyword-to-text generation, and word reordering in Manchu by a large margin. For example, math reasoning accuracy is improved from 18.7% to 75%.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting and evaluating \method to greatly enhance LLMs' understanding and generation abilities for low-resource and endangered languages.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called \method for improving language models' ability to process low-resource and endangered languages. Can you explain in more detail how \method works and what makes it more effective than previous approaches? 

2. The paper evaluates \method on a range of tasks including translation, response selection, math reasoning, word reordering, and keyword-to-text generation. Why is it important to test the method on such a diverse set of tasks spanning different capabilities?

3. Table 1 shows that \method significantly improves performance across many low-resource languages like Manchu, Gitksan, and Arapaho. What language properties allow the method to generalize so well across typologically diverse languages?  

4. Could you analyze the error cases and failure modes of \method more thoroughly? When does it still struggle to improve language models' capabilities?

5. The paper compares \method against several baselines like zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought. Can you better explain the differences between these methods and why \method outperforms them? 

6. Could the paper have evaluated the approach on additional endangered or low-resource languages beyond the ones tested? What other languages would be informative to analyze?

7. The linguistic knowledge and lexicons used by \method come from specific sources detailed in Appendix A. To what extent does the approach depend on the quality and completeness of these resources?

8. Theprompt engineering for \method seems quite complex as shown in Appendix B. How important is prompt engineering to the success of the approach? Could the method work with simpler prompts?  

9. Error analysis suggests that \method struggles more when translating concepts that are less common in the low-resource language. How could the approach be improved to handle such cases better?

10. The paper focuses on improving existing large language models. Could similar self-supervision techniques be used to train new models specifically for low-resource and endangered languages? What challenges would this entail?
