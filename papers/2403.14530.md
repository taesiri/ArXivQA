## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging 3D scene representation for novel view synthesis that enables rapid differentiable rendering. However, it requires a large number of 3D Gaussians to represent complex scenes, necessitating effective compression techniques. Compressing the sparse and unorganized Gaussians is challenging as most methods focus solely on parameter values via pruning or quantization, ignoring inherent spatial relations. The state-of-the-art method, Scaffold-GS, introduces anchors to cluster Gaussians but still treats anchors independently.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework to exploit spatial consistencies of anchors using a structured hash grid for compact 3DGS representation. Specifically:

- A binary hash grid is jointly learned and queried at anchor locations to obtain interpolated hash features. Instead of direct substitution, hash features are used as context to predict anchor attribute distributions.

- An Adaptive Quantization Module (AQM) adjusts quantization steps for different attributes. Gaussian distributions are used to model attribute value distributions for entropy coding.

- Adaptive masking further eliminates invalid Gaussians and anchors. Hash grid compression is achieved via binarization and frequency modeling.

Main Contributions:

- Pioneers context modeling for 3DGS compression by establishing relation between unorganized anchors and structured hash grid.

- Proposes using hash features as context to predict attribute value distributions to facilitate entropy coding. Introduces AQM and masking for improved rate-distortion performance.

- Achieves over 75x compression ratio over vanilla 3DGS and 11x over Scaffold-GS on five datasets with even improved fidelity. Demonstrates effectiveness of each component via ablations.

In summary, this paper innovatively exploits spatial context in 3DGS using hash features, pioneering context-based compression for 3DGS and enabling substantial compression ratios with high fidelity. The proposed context modeling framework significantly advances 3DGS compression.
