# [Dimension Mixer: A Generalized Method for Structured Sparsity in Deep   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18735)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a general framework for structured signal processing in neural networks called the Dimension Mixer model. It allows for group-wise mixing of input signals processed in a layered fashion for complete communication between all input and output dimensions. Drawing inspiration from the efficiency of the Fast Fourier Transform's butterfly matrices, the authors generalize butterfly structures to non-linear mixing functions like MLPs and attention, coining the terms Butterfly MLP and Butterfly Attention. Experiments demonstrate Butterfly MLP's improved performance over linear variants when sparsifying MLP Mixer's dense layers. Butterfly Attention scales better on tasks with long input sequences compared to standard attention, while still achieving high performance on image tasks by leveraging the induced locality bias from patching. The proposed Patch-Only MLP Mixer unifies aspects of MLP Mixer and CNNs through a patch-only mixing strategy. Overall, the Dimension Mixer framework and its instantiations enable more efficient and accurate neural architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a generalized dimension mixing method called Dimension Mixer that uses group-wise sparse, non-linear, multi-layered, and learnable mixing schemes of inputs, applies it to MLP and Attention layers using butterfly sparse structure for efficiency, and presents a Patch-Only MLP Mixer model for vision between MLP-Mixer and CNN architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a general sparse signal processing model called the Dimension Mixer model. This model leverages group-wise mixing of input signals, processed in a layer-wise fashion to allow communication between all input and output dimensions.

2. It generalizes the butterfly structure (commonly used in FFT) to go beyond linear transforms, allowing the use of non-linear mixing functions like MLPs and Attention layers. This is done through proposals like Butterfly MLP and Butterfly Attention.

3. It devises a new mixing strategy for 2D images called the Patch-Only MLP Mixer which lies between the original MLP Mixer and CNN architectures. This view helps unify the working mechanisms of both.  

4. Through experiments on datasets like CIFAR and LRA, the paper demonstrates that the proposed non-linear butterfly mixers are efficient, scale well, and allow the host architectures to be used as mixing functions.

5. It shows that techniques like Butterfly Attention perform better than standard attention on tasks like image classification while being faster and more memory efficient.

6. The paper demonstrates the ability of the method to solve challenging tasks like Pathfinder-X that remained unsolved by prior work. This highlights the efficiency and generality of the approach.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a general dimension mixing concept and its sparse non-linear application to various neural architectures.
