# [Curriculum-Enhanced Residual Soft An-Isotropic Normalization for   Over-smoothness in Deep GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08221)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new deep graph neural network model called SmoothCurriculum-improved R-SoftGraphAIN to alleviate two major issues that hinder the performance of deep GNNs: over-smoothing and difficult optimization. First, it introduces R-SoftGraphAIN, a novel residual connections-based soft graph normalization layer, which employs normalization on the covariance matrix of node embeddings rather than individual nodes or signals. This allows maximally preserving feature and structural knowledge diversity even in very deep GNNs. Second, to ease optimization difficulty, the paper develops SmoothCurriculum, an effective curriculum learning framework based on iterative label smoothing on an auxiliary graph. This implicitly encourages learning from easy (global, low-frequency) to hard (local, high-frequency) knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on various graph node classification tasks. The proposed techniques provide useful ideas on improving deep GNN model capability and optimization.
