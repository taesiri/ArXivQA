# [Plan-Grounded Large Language Models for Dual Goal Conversational   Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current LLMs are only trained to follow user instructions, but not lead a dialogue through a procedural plan while also addressing the user's changing needs. 
- Needed are LLMs that can both guide users through plans of procedures (e.g. recipes, DIY tasks) and adaptively answer questions grounded in the plan context.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a plan-grounded LLM assistant that can navigate procedural plans while handling user questions, requests for substitutions, fun facts etc. 
- Train the LLM with 4 objectives: navigate plans, answer grounded questions, handle open-ended requests, follow conversational norms.
- Use supervised pretraining and preference learning (DPO algorithm) to optimize the objectives.

Key Contributions:
1) LLM grounds conversations on procedural plans, tracks progress through plans, and activates safety guardrails.
2) Answers user questions grounded in the plan context using knowledge from previous turns, plan steps or external knowledge. 
3) Handles open-ended requests like suggesting replacements or fun facts based on plan elements.
4) Respects conversational norms - keeps users safe, is polite, steers away from inappropriate requests.

Experiments show the proposed model (PlanLLM) improves performance 2.1x over strong baselines. Evaluation also demonstrates good generalization to unseen domains, indicating robust plan grounding and reasoning abilities.

Overall, the paper makes important contributions in developing LLMs that can lead mixed-initiative goal-driven conversations grounded on procedural plans.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel large language model called PlanLLM that can ground dialogues on procedural plans, take dialogue initiative, enforce conversational guardrails, and handle unexpected user behavior, achieving improved performance on guiding users through tasks compared to strong baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel large language model called PlanLLM that:

1) Can ground its behavior in procedural plans. It can navigate through a procedural plan and keep track of the dialogue state. 

2) Can follow user questions that are grounded on the plan of procedures. It can answer questions that emerge as the conversation advances, with the answers coming from previous conversation turns, the plan's steps, or external general knowledge.

3) Can answer open-ended requests that have a human preference implied, such as suggesting a replacement for a missing resource or suggesting a plan-related fun fact. 

4) Aligns the model with conversational norms to steer users away from unsafe or unethical requests while being polite.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing PlanLLM, a large language model tailored for dual goal mixed-initiative conversational settings, where the model guides the user through a procedural plan while also adapting to user instructions and questions.

The paper proposes a novel LLM called PlanLLM that can ground its behavior on procedural plans, take dialogue initiative, enforce guardrails, and improve responses to unexpected user behavior. It is trained using plan supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to optimize different objectives like following the plan, answering user questions, handling open-ended requests, and upholding conversational norms. The model is evaluated on its ability to navigate plans, answer questions, provide substitutions, give relevant facts, be polite and safe. Experiments demonstrate the model's improved performance over baselines and ability to generalize to unseen domains in a zero-shot manner.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed model balance following a procedural plan with responding to arbitrary user requests and instructions? What mechanisms allow it to switch between these two objectives?

2. The paper proposes a multi-objective training paradigm with different loss functions for different types of user requests (navigation, QA, etc.). How is the appropriate loss function selected during training for each user request?

3. The proposed model uses reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for preference learning. What are the challenges of using RLHF and how does the model attempt to mitigate them? 

4. How does the model leverage existing conversational data to simulate realistic user behavior? What techniques are used to augment this data?

5. What is the role of tone-of-voice conditioning in the model? How does it allow flexibility in the system's responses?

6. How does the model attempt to provide safety guardrails on its behavior? What approaches allow it to identify and avoid unsafe requests?  

7. What methods were used for automatic and human evaluation of the model? What were the key results demonstrating the model's capabilities?

8. How does the model architecture and training regime change when optimizing the supervised fine-tuning vs preference optimization objectives?

9. What evidence supports the model's ability to generalize to unseen procedural domains? How was this capability evaluated?

10. What are the limitations of the proposed approach? What aspects of dual-goal conversational settings does it still struggle with?
