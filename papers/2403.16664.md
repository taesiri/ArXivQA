# [Skill Q-Network: Learning Adaptive Skill Ensemble for Mapless Navigation   in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16664)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mapless navigation in unknown environments is challenging for robots. They need to balance exploring new areas and navigating towards goals without getting trapped. 
- Existing methods like SLAM are complex, rely on handcrafted rules, and may not generalize. End-to-end reinforcement learning methods struggle to learn diverse navigation skills within one policy network.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Skill Q-Network (SQN), a novel deep Q-learning method with an adaptive skill ensemble mechanism. 
- SQN has multiple latent skill policy modules and a skill decision module to infer importance scores for skills. This enables learning a high-level decision process alongside low-level navigation skills.
- A tailored reward function encourages exploring unknown areas and exploiting reachable goals. This helps learn adaptive maneuvers combining exploration and goal-directed skills.

Main Contributions:
- SQN adaptively combines navigation skills without needing predefined skills or prior skill-level knowledge. The skill decision mechanism and latent policies enable learning diverse strategies.
- Experiments show SQN achieves 40% higher navigation performance over baselines in complex environments. It discovers maneuvers to escape local minima and reach goals.
- The adaptive ensemble method enables zero-shot transfer of SQN to new out-of-distribution environments with unseen terrain patterns. SQN can handle novel observations and scenarios.

In summary, the paper presents Skill Q-Network, a novel deep reinforcement learning approach using an adaptive skill ensemble technique to learn diverse navigation strategies. Without prior skill knowledge, SQN balances exploration and exploitation to effectively navigate complex unknown environments, outperforming existing methods.
