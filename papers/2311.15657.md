# [Enhancing Diffusion Models with Text-Encoder Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15657)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TexForce, an innovative method that applies reinforcement learning with low-rank adaptation to enhance the text encoder of diffusion models using task-specific rewards. The key insight is that finetuning the typically fixed text encoder can significantly improve text-image alignment in generated images, thereby enhancing quality. TexForce is based on the DDPO algorithm and finetunes the text encoder to better satisfy rewards capturing desired attributes like aesthetics or text coherence. A notable advantage is the flexibility to fuse different low-rank adapted text encoders for diverse applications without retraining. Comprehensive experiments validate that TexForce outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both single and multi-prompt tasks. The results clearly demonstrate enhanced text-image alignment capabilities. Furthermore, TexForce can be seamlessly combined with existing diffusion model finetuning techniques to achieve much better performance. Diverse applications like high-quality face and hand image generation showcase the impressive adaptability of TexForce across different rewards and model backbones.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing TexForce, a method that applies reinforcement learning combined with low-rank adaptation to enhance the text encoder of diffusion models using task-specific rewards. Specifically, the key aspects are:

1) Demonstrating that finetuning the text encoder can significantly improve the text-image alignment and visual quality of diffusion model outputs. This is in contrast to most prior work that only finetunes the U-Net.
