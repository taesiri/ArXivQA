# [Fast and accurate sparse-view CBCT reconstruction using meta-learned   neural attenuation field and hash-encoding regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01689)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a fast and accurate sparse-view CBCT reconstruction (FACT) method that provides better image quality and faster optimization compared to existing methods when using a very limited number of X-ray projections (<50 views). The FACT method first meta-trains a neural network using only 15 CBCT scans to initialize the model weights. Then, during testing, a novel regularization technique is introduced for the hash-encoding process that prevents overfitting to high-frequency noise early in optimization. Experiments using simulated CBCT projections for multiple body parts (chest, head, abdomen) and CT scanner vendors (Siemens, Phillips, GE) show the FACT method produces superior reconstruction quality over conventional analytical (FDK) and iterative (SART, ASD-POCS) methods. Compared to the recent neural attenuation field (NAF) method, FACT achieves better image quality while requiring only 8-14% of the optimization time. The consistent performance across different data and faster optimization demonstrate the promise of FACT for practical usage in sparse-view CBCT scenarios needing fast scan times like patient positioning and emergency imaging.
