# [Curriculum Learning with Adam: The Devil Is in the Wrong Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12202)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Why have curriculum learning (CL) methods achieved only limited success in natural language processing (NLP), despite being successful in other areas like computer vision and reinforcement learning? The key hypothesis explored in the paper is that the mixed results of CL in NLP may be related to the widespread use of the Adam optimization algorithm in the field. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that curricula often interact with Adam in a way that produces suboptimal results, unless Adam's hyperparameters are properly tuned.The paper investigates this hypothesis through several experiments that analyze the interactions between curricula and Adam. The authors test their hypothesis with different CL methods, including automated curricula like the commentaries framework and more simple handcrafted curricula. Across these methods, they find evidence that curricula can produce artificial gains in learning speed due to unintended interactions with Adam, rather than beneficial ordering of training data. With properly tuned Adam hyperparameters, vanilla Adam without curriculum learning tends to perform as well or better.In summary, the central research question is why CL has shown limited gains in NLP, and the key hypothesis is that problematic interactions with Adam may explain these limited results when hyperparameters are not optimized. The authors perform experiments to provide evidence for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is showing that curriculum learning (CL) methods often work not due to creating a beneficial data ordering, but rather through unintended interactions with the Adam optimization algorithm. Specifically:- The paper first conducts a case study on an automated CL method called "commentaries" from computer vision, showing it can also work for NLP tasks. However, a deeper analysis reveals the performance gains are brittle and actually stem from curriculum-Adam interactions that scale up parameter updates, not a sound curriculum strategy. - The paper then shows these curriculum-Adam interactions also occur with common hand-crafted CL methods in NLP that order data by difficulty measures like sequence length. The interactions again scale up parameter updates when the curriculum distribution shifts most rapidly.- Simply tuning Adam's hyperparameters properly allows it to match or outperform the CL methods in all experiments. The paper thus argues the CL benefits are illusory and originate from compensating for suboptimal Adam settings rather than better data ordering.In summary, the key contribution is providing an extensive empirical analysis showing common CL methods in NLP are significantly less effective than believed due to unintended curriculum-Adam interactions, rather than beneficial data ordering. The results urge caution in claiming positive CL results without rigorous controls.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The TL;DR of this paper is that curriculum learning methods often do not actually improve learning, but rather they interact with the Adam optimization algorithm in a way that compensates for suboptimal hyperparameters. The authors show that with properly tuned hyperparameters, vanilla Adam without curriculum learning performs as well or better.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in curriculum learning:- This paper investigates curriculum learning in the context of natural language processing tasks, which has seen limited success compared to other areas like computer vision and reinforcement learning. The authors try to provide insights into why curriculum learning has not been very effective for NLP.- The paper focuses specifically on issues that arise from using curriculum learning with the Adam optimization algorithm, which is ubiquitous in NLP. Most prior work has not analyzed these interactions between curricula and optimizers in depth. - The paper tests both automated (learned) curriculum methods like Commentaries as well as hand-crafted/predefined curricula. This allows them to generalize their findings beyond one specific curriculum approach.- The paper employs a empirical analysis approach by doing controlled experiments and ablations to isolate the effects of curriculum-optimizer interactions. This is a useful methodology to clearly demonstrate these effects.- The paper builds on prior theoretical motivations for curriculum learning like starting small, curriculum as a continuation method, etc. But the authors' analysis reveals these do not tell the full story and optimizer interactions play a key role too.- Overall, this paper provides a novel perspective and investigation into why curriculum learning has not been very fruitful for NLP. The insights on curriculum-optimizer interactions are an important contribution compared to prior art.In summary, the paper offers a fresh empirical perspective to understand the limitations of curriculum learning for NLP based on how curricula interact with Adam optimization. The controlled analysis is thorough and allows the authors to make contributions beyond just one curriculum approach. This helps advance the broader understanding and adoption of curricula in NLP.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Studying how curriculum learning interacts with other optimization algorithms besides Adam. The paper focuses on interactions with Adam, but curricula may interact differently with other optimizers like SGD. Exploring these interactions could provide more insights.- Developing techniques to disentangle the effects of curriculum learning from optimizer interactions. The authors show the performance gains from curricula can actually arise from interactions with the optimizer, rather than the curriculum itself. New methods could try to isolate the true effects of the curriculum.- Analyzing other automated curriculum learning approaches besides Commentaries. The authors focus their analysis on the Commentaries method, but other automated curricula may exhibit similar issues. Analyzing these other methods could reveal if the observed issues generalize. - Considering the role of hyperparameters more closely when designing curricula. The authors show properly tuned hyperparameters with vanilla Adam can outperform curricula. Accounting for hyperparameters more explicitly when developing curricula could improve their effectiveness.- Developing theoretical understandings of how and why curricula interact with optimization algorithms. The paper empirically demonstrates these interactions, but formal theoretical analysis could provide more fundamental insights.- Testing curricula on broader sets of NLP tasks and models. The authors focus on analyzing curricula for GLUE fine-tuning. Testing on a wider range of NLP problems and model architectures would show if the findings generalize more broadly.So in summary, the authors highlight several productive directions such as studying other optimizers, isolating curriculum effects, analyzing other curriculum methods, incorporating hyperparameters, developing theory, and testing on more NLP settings. Advancing research in these areas could lead to improved understanding and design of curricula learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper explores why curriculum learning (CL) methods have achieved only limited success in natural language processing (NLP). The authors start with an attempt to replicate and extend recent curriculum learning approaches from computer vision to NLP tasks. They find that the results are brittle and inconsistent when applied to NLP. Through analysis, they determine that many CL methods interact with the Adam optimization algorithm in a way that scales the parameter updates, similar to changing the learning rate. This scaling effect compensates for suboptimal hyperparameters and creates the illusion of faster learning due to the curriculum. However, properly tuned hyperparameters with vanilla Adam consistently match or outperform CL methods in the authors' experiments. They test hand-crafted and automated curricula and find the interaction occurs across different settings. The results indicate widely-used CL methods in NLP are not actually providing curriculum-based benefits beyond reducing the need to tune hyperparameters. The authors urge caution in claiming positive curriculum learning results when using Adam optimization.
