# [Grounding Language Model with Chunking-Free In-Context Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems struggle to ground responses using precise evidence text from lengthy retrieved documents. 
- Challenges include: 1) Models can't handle long contexts well, 2) Irrelevant content in documents leads models astray.
- Common solutions have limitations: 1) Document chunking disrupts semantic coherence, 2) Adapting models for longer contexts doesn't address noise/inaccuracy in retrieval.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Chunking-Free In-Context (CFIC) retrieval to locate precise evidence without chunking documents.  
- Leverage document's encoded transformer states for retrieval via auto-aggressive decoding to pinpoint specific evidence for queries.
- Enhance CFIC with two decoding strategies:
   1) Constrained Sentence Prefix Decoding: Limits decoding candidates to document-dependent prefixes to improve efficiency and faithfulness.  
   2) Skip Decoding: Bypasses intermediate tokens once prefix is identified, terminating when token with highest [eos] likelihood is found.
- Train CFIC via Supervised Fine-Tuning on dataset with (document, question, evidence) triplets.

Main Contributions:
- Propose CFIC - a chunking-free in-context retrieval method to locate precise text evidence to ground RAG systems without need for document chunking.
- Enhance CFIC's long context abilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning on constructed dataset.  
- Design two decoding strategies that significantly improve efficiency and accuracy of CFIC's decoding process.
- Evaluations demonstrate CFIC's superior performance in retrieving accurate and relevant evidence compared to traditional methods.

In summary, CFIC offers a more streamlined and effective retrieval solution for RAG systems by eliminating the reliance on document chunking.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel Chunking-Free In-Context retrieval approach that leverages transformer hidden states to accurately pinpoint precise textual evidence from lengthy documents to ground response generation in retrieval-augmented systems, eliminating the need for passage chunking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel Chunking-Free In-Context (CFIC) retrieval approach specifically designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. CFIC circumvents the conventional chunking process and utilizes auto-aggressive decoding to directly identify precise evidence text from lengthy documents to ground the response generation, eliminating the need for chunking.

2. It introduces two decoding strategies - Constrained Sentence Prefix Decoding and Skip Decoding - that improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the evidence retrieval process in CFIC. These strategies accelerate inference and ensure the fidelity of the generated textual evidence. 

3. It demonstrates through evaluations on various open QA datasets that CFIC achieves significant improvements in retrieving relevant and accurate textual evidence compared to traditional chunking-based methods. This offers a more streamlined and effective solution for evidence retrieval in RAG systems.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel chunking-free retrieval approach that generates precise grounding text evidence for RAG systems through constrained decoding, outperforming conventional chunking-based methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): The framework of combining a retriever module with a generator module for text generation. A core focus of this paper.

- Grounding: The idea of grounding the generated text in evidence from documents to reduce hallucination. A key motivation.  

- Document chunking: Splitting long documents into shorter passages, a common technique in RAG systems. The paper aims to avoid this.

- In-context retrieval: Generating precise evidence text directly from document hidden states without chunking the document. The key proposal.

- Constrained sentence prefix decoding: Constraining the decoding to only generate sentences that originate from the source text. Ensures faithfulness.

- Skip decoding: Skipping the decoding of intermediate tokens once the sentence prefix is found. Improves efficiency.  

- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT): Fine-tuning the foundation model on a dataset to adapt it to the evidence retrieval task. Critical for model's capability.

- Long contexts: A key capability of the model is to handle long input contexts up to 32k tokens.

In summary, the core focus is on "chunking-free in-context retrieval" to locate accurate grounding text from documents to enhance RAG systems without disrupting document semantics. The proposed strategies and SFT enable this effectively.
