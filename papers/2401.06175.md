## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Anomaly detection on multivariate time series key performance indicators (KPIs) is important to monitor system health. Many methods have been proposed but lack rigorous comparison. 
- Existing evaluations have issues: 
  1) Point adjustment in accuracy computation can dominate false positives, leading to misleadingly high scores.  
  2) Models with similar accuracy can have very different anomaly score distributions. 
  3) Evaluation is not comprehensive - metrics like delay and efficiency are ignored.
- Reproducing results is difficult due to lack of implementation details.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a comprehensive benchmark protocol to evaluate accuracy, salience, delay and efficiency of anomaly detectors.
- Propose a new metric called "salience" to measure how well a model highlights anomalies compared to normal data. It is computed by statistical discrepancy between supporting points in anomalous and normal regions.
- Implement an easy-to-use toolkit with uniform interfaces to automate evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive protocol and new salience metric for evaluating multivariate KPI anomaly detectors. 
- Re-evaluate 12 state-of-the-art methods (5 traditional ML and 7 Deep Learning) on 5 public datasets.
- Key observations:
   1) Deep learning methods do not necessarily outperform traditional ML in accuracy.  
   2) Deep learning better at catching long anomalies, traditional ML catches short anomalies.
   3) High accuracy does not mean high salience. 
   4) Traditional ML detects anomalies faster than deep learning methods.
   5) Traditional ML is efficient in both training and testing while deep learning needs GPUs.
- Release an open source toolkit to benefit research and industry.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark protocol with a new metric called salience to evaluate multivariate time series anomaly detection methods on accuracy, delay, efficiency, and how well anomalies stand out; applies the protocol to compare 12 methods on 5 datasets; and releases a toolkit to facilitate further research and industrial adoption.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors propose a comprehensive benchmark protocol with a novel metric called "salience" to evaluate multivariate time series anomaly detection methods. The protocol aims to address limitations of existing evaluation approaches such as potentially misleading high accuracy scores and lack of comprehensiveness. 

2) Under this unified protocol, the authors re-evaluate 12 state-of-the-art methods (5 general ML-based and 7 DL-based) on 5 public multivariate time series datasets. The experimental results reveal several interesting observations about the relative strengths and weaknesses of different methods.

3) The authors implement and release an easy-to-use open source toolkit that automates the evaluation of multivariate anomaly detection methods using their proposed benchmark protocol. This is expected to benefit both research and industry work on developing advanced anomaly detection algorithms.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous benchmarking framework and tool for evaluating multivariate time series anomaly detection methods to facilitate methodological improvements and adoption in real-world applications. The experimental study also provides useful insights into the current state-of-the-art in this area.

- Benchmark protocol
- Accuracy
- Salience (proposed novel metric)

The paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark protocol to evaluate different multivariate time series anomaly detection methods on KPIs data. It introduces a new metric called "salience" in addition to accuracy, delay and efficiency. Both traditional machine learning and recent deep learning based methods are evaluated and compared using this protocol on several public multivariate time series datasets. The key goal is to provide a standardized framework for evaluating and selecting suitable anomaly detection algorithms for practical deployments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called "salience" to measure how well an anomaly detector highlights the anomalies compared to normal data points. How is salience mathematically formulated? Explain the key components like support points and discrepancy measurement. 

2. One motivation mentioned in the paper is that models with similar accuracy may behave very differently in practice. How does the proposed salience metric help address this issue? Provide some examples to illustrate your point.

3. The paper argues that using adjusted F1 score as the optimization target can produce misleadingly high accuracy results. Explain why this occurs, especially in cases with long consecutive anomaly segments. 

4. Describe the complete benchmark protocol proposed in the paper for evaluating multivariate time series anomaly detectors. Explain each evaluation metric and how they address limitations of existing protocols.

5. The experiments reveal that deep learning methods do not always outperform traditional machine learning techniques. Analyze the results and discuss why traditional methods like KNN perform the best on some datasets.

6. Explain the efficiency evaluation performed in the paper. What conclusions can be drawn about efficiency of deep learning vs machine learning anomaly detection techniques?

7. The delay metric aims to measure how quickly methods detect anomalies after their onset. Analyze the delay results - which categories of techniques generally have lower delay and why?

8. Discuss the tool implementation in the paper and how it helps address reproducibility issues in anomaly detection research. What key functionalities does it provide?

9. The related work section summarizes different categories of multivariate anomaly detection techniques. Choose two categories and explain how the benchmark protocol can help distinguish their strengths/weaknesses. 

10. If you were using the proposed benchmark protocol and tool to select an anomaly detection method for a new application, what are the key factors you would consider in making a selection?
