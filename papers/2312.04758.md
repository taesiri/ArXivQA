# [Physics-Informed Convolutional Autoencoder for Cyber Anomaly Detection   in Power Distribution Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04758)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel physics-informed convolutional autoencoder (PIConvAE) for detecting cyber attacks in power distribution grids. The model integrates physical principles from power flow equations into the loss function of a convolutional autoencoder using Kirchhoff's law constraints. This improves detection performance and reduces training time compared to a standard convolutional autoencoder. The PIConvAE model works in an unsupervised manner without requiring labeled cyber attack data. Experiments on the IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus systems with simulated false data injection attacks demonstrate superior performance from the PIConvAE in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The model also excels in detecting attacks across a wide range of magnitudes, making it well-suited for identifying stealthy attacks. Overall, the integration of domain knowledge through physics-based loss constraints enhances the cyber anomaly detection capabilities of deep convolutional autoencoders.
