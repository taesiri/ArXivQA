# [UniMD: Towards Unifying Moment Retrieval and Temporal Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Temporal Action Detection (TAD) focuses on detecting predefined actions, while Moment Retrieval (MR) aims to identify events described in natural language within untrimmed videos. Despite focusing on different events, these two tasks have significant connections, for example, most descriptions in MR involve multiple actions from TAD. However, most existing works treat them as separate tasks using different models. This paper investigates whether fusing TAD and MR in a single model can enable them to benefit each other.

Proposed Solution:
1) A unified architecture called UniMD that handles both TAD and MR in one model by transforming their inputs into a common embedding space and using two novel query-dependent decoders to generate a uniform output of classification scores and temporal segments.

2) Two task fusion learning approaches of pre-training and co-training to enhance the mutual benefits: 
- Pre-training: Train a model on one task and use that knowledge to improve the other task's performance. 
- Co-training: Train both tasks simultaneously starting from a randomly initialized model. Three co-training sampling methods are explored - synchronized, alternating, and random.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose UniMD, a unified framework to address TAD and MR simultaneously using uniform interfaces and query-dependent decoders.

2) Explore task fusion learning to investigate if the two tasks can help each other. Propose an effective co-training method utilizing synchronized task sampling that enhances the synergy.

3) Experiments show UniMD achieves state-of-the-art on Ego4D, Charades-STA and ActivityNet. Co-training even with a subset of data outperforms dedicated models trained on full data, demonstrating the effectiveness of task fusion.

In summary, this paper proposes a unified model for temporal action detection and moment retrieval, and shows these two tasks can mutually benefit each other via an effective task fusion learning approach. The unified model achieves new state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.
