# [Pedestrian and Passenger Interaction with Autonomous Vehicles: Field   Study in a Crosswalk Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and humans (pedestrians, passengers) are safety-critical and directly impact user acceptance and trust. Effective communication of AV intentions is key.  
- Prior work has limitations: simulated environments, Wizard-of-Oz AV control, pedestrians not actually crossing, or real crossing with human-driven vehicles.
- Research gap exists in studying real AV interactions with pedestrians crossing and passengers inside the AV.

Solution:
- Conduct real-world experiments with a fully automated vehicle and real pedestrian crossings to evaluate different communication mechanisms.
- Vehicle equipped with internal HMI (iHMI) screen and speakers to communicate with passengers. 
- External HMI (eHMI) RGB LED strip to visually communicate intentions to pedestrians.
- Test gentle vs aggressive braking profiles (implicit communication).
- Combine iHMI, eHMI and braking profiles in different tests.  
- Measure pedestrian crossing decisions and passenger reactions via sensors, video and surveys.

Contributions:
- Novel study of real AV interactions with pedestrians and passengers in crosswalk scenario.
- Evaluation of different explicit (iHMI, eHMI) and implicit (vehicle dynamics) communication methods. 
- Analysis of pedestrian crossing decisions and passenger confidence from sensor measurements and questionnaires.
- Key findings on the effects of different HMIs and braking profiles on improving pedestrian and passenger confidence.
- Insights into gaps between perceived confidence via surveys vs actual crossing behavior from sensor measurements.

In summary, this pioneering real-world AV interaction study provides important insights to guide the design of HMIs and vehicle behavior for improving trust and safety.
