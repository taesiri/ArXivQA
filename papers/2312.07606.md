# [Pedestrian and Passenger Interaction with Autonomous Vehicles: Field   Study in a Crosswalk Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and humans (pedestrians, passengers) are safety-critical and directly impact user acceptance and trust. Effective communication of AV intentions is key.  
- Prior work has limitations: simulated environments, Wizard-of-Oz AV control, pedestrians not actually crossing, or real crossing with human-driven vehicles.
- Research gap exists in studying real AV interactions with pedestrians crossing and passengers inside the AV.

Solution:
- Conduct real-world experiments with a fully automated vehicle and real pedestrian crossings to evaluate different communication mechanisms.
- Vehicle equipped with internal HMI (iHMI) screen and speakers to communicate with passengers. 
- External HMI (eHMI) RGB LED strip to visually communicate intentions to pedestrians.
- Test gentle vs aggressive braking profiles (implicit communication).
- Combine iHMI, eHMI and braking profiles in different tests.  
- Measure pedestrian crossing decisions and passenger reactions via sensors, video and surveys.

Contributions:
- Novel study of real AV interactions with pedestrians and passengers in crosswalk scenario.
- Evaluation of different explicit (iHMI, eHMI) and implicit (vehicle dynamics) communication methods. 
- Analysis of pedestrian crossing decisions and passenger confidence from sensor measurements and questionnaires.
- Key findings on the effects of different HMIs and braking profiles on improving pedestrian and passenger confidence.
- Insights into gaps between perceived confidence via surveys vs actual crossing behavior from sensor measurements.

In summary, this pioneering real-world AV interaction study provides important insights to guide the design of HMIs and vehicle behavior for improving trust and safety.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents results from real-world experiments evaluating how explicit communication through internal and external human-machine interfaces and implicit communication through vehicle braking behavior affect pedestrian and passenger confidence when interacting with an autonomous vehicle at a crosswalk.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting the results of a real-world field study on human-vehicle interaction in crosswalk scenarios, involving both pedestrians and passengers interacting with an autonomous vehicle. The study evaluates different types of internal and external human-machine interfaces (HMIs), as well as implicit communication through vehicle dynamics, using both behavioral and attitudinal evaluation methods. The key findings include:

- The use of gentle braking maneuvers and external HMIs increases pedestrians' confidence in the AV and leads to earlier crossing decisions. 

- Internal HMIs increase passengers' confidence in the AV when paired with aggressive braking maneuvers. 

- There is a difference between pedestrians' self-reported confidence when using external HMIs and their actual crossing behavior, suggesting vehicle dynamics have more impact on crossing decisions.

- After interacting with the AV, most participants reported increased confidence as both passengers and pedestrians.

The study provides a holistic analysis of AV-human interaction in crosswalks, considering both passengers and pedestrians, through real-world experimentation. The findings highlight the complex interplay between explicit interfaces, implicit communication, and perceived confidence/risk.

The paper presents results from real-world experiments involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with pedestrians and passengers in a crosswalk scenario. It evaluates different internal and external interfaces, braking behaviors, and communication mechanisms in terms of their impact on confidence levels and risk perception. Both subjective (questionnaires) and objective (measurements) data are analyzed to draw conclusions. The key focus is on understanding how to improve trust and acceptance of autonomous vehicles through human-vehicle interaction design.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using both behavioral and attitudinal evaluation methods. Can you expand more on the specifics of each method and how they were used to evaluate the different types of communication techniques? 

2. In the description of the internal and external HMIs, it is mentioned they use different modalities like visual, audio, video etc. Can you explain if any analysis was done on the effectiveness of each individual modality and if there were any key insights on which ones worked best?

3. The paper categorizes vehicle dynamics as a form of implicit communication. Can you expand more on how exactly vehicle dynamics like braking maneuvers convey information and how this was modeled in the experiments? 

4. For the gentle and aggressive braking maneuvers, can you explain if any passenger/pedestrian feedback was incorporated to tune these profiles or were they defined only based on technical metrics like deceleration thresholds?

5. It is mentioned that the backup driver and system supervisor were present but did not intervene during autonomous operation. Was there any mechanism to control for or measure if their presence unconsciously affected participant behavior?  

6. The alternative hypothesis testing approach is used for both questionnaire responses and measured variables. What was the rationale behind choosing this method over other statistical analysis techniques?

7. For the pedestrian decision to cross model, can you expand more on how the crossing event and decision were defined and detected from the data? Were there any cases where these two events did not correlate?

8. The solid angle model is introduced as an extension over the time to collision metric. How was this model formulated and validated? Were there any cases or scenarios where using solid angle provided different insights compared to TTC?

9. It is mentioned that combining eHMI with gentle braking increased confidence but not crossing decision timing. Do you have any insights on why this discrepancy occurred and how it can be addressed?

10. The study limitations mention potential gaps compared to real-world interactions. Can you suggest ways in which this experiment could be improved to better match complex real-world human decision making?
