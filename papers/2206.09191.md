# [Gender Artifacts in Visual Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09191)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:To what extent can gendered information truly be removed from large-scale visual datasets like COCO and OpenImages? The authors investigate the prevalence of "gender artifacts", or visual cues correlated with gender labels, in these datasets. Their goal is to understand the feasibility and practicality of common approaches that attempt to remove gender biases by eliminating gendered information from images.The main hypothesis seems to be that gender artifacts are intricately embedded throughout these datasets, and trying to remove them may be a futile endeavor. The experiments aim to identify and analyze different types of gender artifacts to support this hypothesis.In summary, the paper focuses on critically examining whether "fairness through blindness" approaches that occlude or eliminate gender information can effectively eliminate gender biases, or if the gender artifacts are simply too ubiquitous in visual datasets.
