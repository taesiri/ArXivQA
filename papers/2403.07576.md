# [FPT: Fine-grained Prompt Tuning for Parameter and Memory Efficient Fine   Tuning in High-resolution Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained models (LPMs) on downstream tasks is very expensive due to the high cost of updating all the parameters. 
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to selectively update a subset of parameters, but they still have high memory requirements, especially for high-resolution inputs commonly used in medical imaging.

Proposed Solution:
- A new PEFT method called Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (FPT) which significantly reduces memory consumption compared to prior PEFT methods.

Key Ideas:
- Uses a lightweight side network instead of fine-tuning the LPM directly. This avoids expensive backpropagation through the LPM.
- Employs asymmetric input resolutions - high resolution for the frozen LPM and lower resolution for the side network to save memory.
- Introduces "fine-grained prompts" to transfer knowledge from the frozen LPM to the side network.
- Applies "important token selection" to only pass the most relevant tokens to save computation.

Main Contributions:
- First work to improve efficiency of fine-tuning models on high-resolution medical images.
- Achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between performance and parameter/memory efficiency.
- Outperforms prior PEFT methods on 4 medical imaging datasets while using only 1.8% of the learnable parameters and 13% of the memory.
- Proposes new metrics (PPE and PME) to account for both parameter and memory efficiency.

In summary, the paper presents a novel fine-tuning approach called FPT that leverages a lightweight side network and other techniques to enable efficient high-resolution transfer learning for medical imaging tasks. Key results demonstrate superior performance-efficiency trade-offs compared to prior PEFT methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel parameter and memory efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method called Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (FPT) for medical image classification in high-resolution contexts. Key innovations include asymmetric input, important token selection, fine-grained prompts, and fine-grained fusion module to improve efficiency.

2. Being the first work to enhance the efficiency of fine-tuning in high-resolution settings, which is important for medical image analysis. 

3. Introducing a new metric to evaluate the trade-off between performance and memory efficiency for fine-tuning methods.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (FPT): The name of the proposed parameter and memory efficient fine-tuning method for medical image classification.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT): The concept of selectively updating a small subset of parameters from a pre-trained model for transfer learning. FPT is presented as a novel PEFT approach.

- Memory-efficient fine-tuning: One of the main goals of FPT is to reduce the memory consumption compared to other methods during fine-tuning, especially for high-resolution images.

- High-resolution medical image classification: The application domain that FPT targets - fine-tuning models for classification tasks using high-resolution medical images.

- Asymmetric input: A technique used in FPT where the frozen pre-trained model takes high-resolution images as input but the side network takes low-resolution images as input to save memory.

- Fine-grained prompts: Learnable prompt embeddings introduced in FPT to summarize information from the frozen pre-trained model and convey it to the side network.

- Important token selection: A method used in FPT to select only the most important tokens from the self-attention map to reduce the input sequence length and memory usage.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes asymmetric input resolution for the frozen pre-trained model and side network. What is the intuition behind using high resolution for the pre-trained model and low resolution for the side network? How does this strategy improve memory efficiency?

2. Fine-grained prompts are introduced in the paper as a bridge to transfer knowledge from the frozen pre-trained model to the side network. Explain the role of fine-grained prompts and how they differ from prompt tuning methods. 

3. The fine-grained fusion module utilizes a cross-attention mechanism. Walk through the calculations involved in applying cross-attention with the fine-grained prompts. What are the advantages of using attention over other fusion approaches?

4. Explain the motivation and implementation details of the important token selection mechanism. How does retaining only the top 20% tokens impact performance and efficiency? Analyze the results in Table 3.

5. Preloading frozen pre-trained features is mentioned to bring training efficiency improvements. Elaborate on how preloading works. Why can't data augmentation be applied to the frozen model?

6. The paper evaluates performance-parameter efficiency (PPE) and performance-memory efficiency (PME) metrics. Compare and contrast these metrics to the existing performance-efficiency (PE) metric. What aspects do PPE and PME capture that PE does not?

7. Analyze the ablation study results in Table 2. Which components lead to the most substantial gains in performance and efficiency? Are there any tradeoffs to consider when adding components?

8. How suitable is the proposed method for clinical adoption? Discuss considerations like inference time, integration with hospital systems, and regulatory procedures. 

9. The method trains an additive lightweight network separate from the large frozen pre-trained model. Compare this to existing approaches like LoRA and BitFit that introduce learnable parameters into the pre-trained model directly. What are the advantages and disadvantages?

10. The paper evaluates the method on multiple medical imaging modalities. What architectural modifications would be required to adopt this method for 3D volumetric data? How could efficiency be improved in that context?
