# [FPT: Fine-grained Prompt Tuning for Parameter and Memory Efficient Fine   Tuning in High-resolution Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained models (LPMs) on downstream tasks is very expensive due to the high cost of updating all the parameters. 
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to selectively update a subset of parameters, but they still have high memory requirements, especially for high-resolution inputs commonly used in medical imaging.

Proposed Solution:
- A new PEFT method called Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (FPT) which significantly reduces memory consumption compared to prior PEFT methods.

Key Ideas:
- Uses a lightweight side network instead of fine-tuning the LPM directly. This avoids expensive backpropagation through the LPM.
- Employs asymmetric input resolutions - high resolution for the frozen LPM and lower resolution for the side network to save memory.
- Introduces "fine-grained prompts" to transfer knowledge from the frozen LPM to the side network.
- Applies "important token selection" to only pass the most relevant tokens to save computation.

Main Contributions:
- First work to improve efficiency of fine-tuning models on high-resolution medical images.
- Achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between performance and parameter/memory efficiency.
- Outperforms prior PEFT methods on 4 medical imaging datasets while using only 1.8% of the learnable parameters and 13% of the memory.
- Proposes new metrics (PPE and PME) to account for both parameter and memory efficiency.

In summary, the paper presents a novel fine-tuning approach called FPT that leverages a lightweight side network and other techniques to enable efficient high-resolution transfer learning for medical imaging tasks. Key results demonstrate superior performance-efficiency trade-offs compared to prior PEFT methods.
