# [Image as a Foreign Language: BEiT Pretraining for All Vision and   Vision-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10442)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a general-purpose multimodal foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision and vision-language tasks?

The key ideas and hypotheses explored in the paper to address this question are:

- Using a Multiway Transformer as a unified architecture to handle different modalities enables both deep fusion and modality-specific encoding for general-purpose modeling.

- Masked "language" modeling as a unified pretraining objective on images, texts, and image-text pairs learns strong transferable representations without fundamental modeling differences between modalities.

- Scaling up the model size, pretraining data size, and treating images as "foreign language" benefits from reuse of large language model pretraining pipelines.

- Their proposed model BEiT-3, pretrained as described above, will achieve SOTA results on a diverse set of vision and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating its capabilities as a general-purpose multimodal foundation model.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a scaled Multiway Transformer pretrained with masked modeling on images, text, and image-text pairs can serve as a powerful general-purpose foundation for both vision and vision-language tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate this via BEiT-3's performance across diverse tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing BEiT-3, a multimodal foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision and vision-language tasks. 

- Introducing Multiway Transformers, a unified architecture that can be used as vision encoders, language encoders, fusion encoders, and dual encoders for different downstream tasks.

- Using a simple yet effective masked data modeling objective to pretrain the model on images, texts, and image-text pairs in a unified manner. Treating images as a foreign "Imglish" language.

- Demonstrating strong transfer performance on a wide range of vision tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification) and vision-language tasks (visual reasoning, VQA, retrieval, captioning).

- Scaling up the model size to billions of parameters and using large-scale public data resources to pretrain the foundation model.

Overall, the key contribution seems to be proposing BEiT-3 as a general-purpose multimodal foundation model that obtains new state-of-the-art results by unifying the model architecture, pretraining objective, and scaling approach across vision and vision-language tasks. The simplicity and strong transfer performance highlight the effectiveness of masked data modeling for representation learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces BEiT-3, a general-purpose multimodal foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision and vision-language tasks. The key ideas are: 1) Using a Multiway Transformer as a unified architecture for various tasks and modalities; 2) Pretraining with masked "language" modeling on images, texts, and image-text pairs; 3) Scaling up the model size, data size, and compute for better generalization. The main result is that BEiT-3 obtains SOTA across object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, visual reasoning, visual QA, image captioning, and retrieval, demonstrating the power of scaling up masked data modeling for multimodal pretraining.
