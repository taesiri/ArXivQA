# [Image as a Foreign Language: BEiT Pretraining for All Vision and   Vision-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10442)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a general-purpose multimodal foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision and vision-language tasks?

The key ideas and hypotheses explored in the paper to address this question are:

- Using a Multiway Transformer as a unified architecture to handle different modalities enables both deep fusion and modality-specific encoding for general-purpose modeling.

- Masked "language" modeling as a unified pretraining objective on images, texts, and image-text pairs learns strong transferable representations without fundamental modeling differences between modalities.

- Scaling up the model size, pretraining data size, and treating images as "foreign language" benefits from reuse of large language model pretraining pipelines.

- Their proposed model BEiT-3, pretrained as described above, will achieve SOTA results on a diverse set of vision and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating its capabilities as a general-purpose multimodal foundation model.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a scaled Multiway Transformer pretrained with masked modeling on images, text, and image-text pairs can serve as a powerful general-purpose foundation for both vision and vision-language tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate this via BEiT-3's performance across diverse tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing BEiT-3, a multimodal foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision and vision-language tasks. 

- Introducing Multiway Transformers, a unified architecture that can be used as vision encoders, language encoders, fusion encoders, and dual encoders for different downstream tasks.

- Using a simple yet effective masked data modeling objective to pretrain the model on images, texts, and image-text pairs in a unified manner. Treating images as a foreign "Imglish" language.

- Demonstrating strong transfer performance on a wide range of vision tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification) and vision-language tasks (visual reasoning, VQA, retrieval, captioning).

- Scaling up the model size to billions of parameters and using large-scale public data resources to pretrain the foundation model.

Overall, the key contribution seems to be proposing BEiT-3 as a general-purpose multimodal foundation model that obtains new state-of-the-art results by unifying the model architecture, pretraining objective, and scaling approach across vision and vision-language tasks. The simplicity and strong transfer performance highlight the effectiveness of masked data modeling for representation learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces BEiT-3, a general-purpose multimodal foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision and vision-language tasks. The key ideas are: 1) Using a Multiway Transformer as a unified architecture for various tasks and modalities; 2) Pretraining with masked "language" modeling on images, texts, and image-text pairs; 3) Scaling up the model size, data size, and compute for better generalization. The main result is that BEiT-3 obtains SOTA across object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, visual reasoning, visual QA, image captioning, and retrieval, demonstrating the power of scaling up masked data modeling for multimodal pretraining.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents a novel multimodal foundation model called BEiT-3 that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision and vision-language tasks. This continues the trend of developing large multimodal models that can be pretrained on diverse data and transferred to downstream tasks, similar to other recent models like ViLBERT, ViLT, Florence, CoCa, etc. 

- The key innovations in BEiT-3 compared to prior work seem to be: 1) Using the Multiway Transformer architecture for unified handling of different modalities and tasks; 2) Relying solely on masked reconstruction as the pretraining objective rather than contrastive learning or other losses; 3) Scaling up model size and pretraining data while using only public resources.

- The simplicity of the masked reconstruction pretraining task seems to be an advantage over prior methods that use multiple pretraining objectives. BEiT-3 shows strong transfer performance can be achieved with a simple strategy.

- In terms of transfer performance, BEiT-3 achieves new state-of-the-art results on major vision and vision-language datasets. The gains over prior models are especially significant on some tasks like visual reasoning and retrieval.

- An interesting finding is the strong performance on vision tasks like detection and segmentation even though the model was not specifically pretrained for these. This demonstrates the versatility of the foundation model.

- For model architecture, using the modular Multiway Transformer seems to be more flexible compared to specialized architectures like single encoders or encoder-decoders used in other models.

- The model scaling experiments confirm the importance of scale for transfer performance. BEiT-3 follows the trend of foundation models getting larger.

In summary, BEiT-3 pushes forward multimodal pretraining research through model architecture innovations, training objective simplicity, and large-scale pretraining. The strong empirical transfer results across modalities demonstrate the potential of the foundation modeling approach.
