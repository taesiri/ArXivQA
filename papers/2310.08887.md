# [METRA: Scalable Unsupervised RL with Metric-Aware Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seems to address is:

How can we develop a scalable unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages an agent to explore its environment and discover a diverse set of useful behaviors, without any reward function or supervision?

The key hypothesis appears to be that instead of trying to directly cover the entire state space, the agent should focus on covering a more compact latent space that is metrically connected to the state space through temporal distances. By maximizing coverage in this latent space, the agent can obtain a tractable set of behaviors that approximately span the original state space, enabling scalability to high-dimensional environments. 

Specifically, the paper proposes an unsupervised RL objective called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA) that maximizes coverage in a latent space defined by a mapping function φ: S → Z, where distances in Z are constrained to be upper bounded by temporal distances in S. The temporal distance provides a representation-invariant metric for connecting the latent and state spaces. 

The central hypothesis is that by maximizing coverage with respect to this temporally constrained latent space, METRA can discover useful diverse behaviors scalably, even in complex pixel-based environments, which poses a major open challenge for previous unsupervised RL methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new unsupervised reinforcement learning objective called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA) for scalable skill discovery. The key ideas are:

- Instead of trying to cover the entire state space, METRA aims to cover a compact latent space Z that is metrically connected to the state space S. This allows it to scale to high-dimensional environments.

- It uses temporal distances (minimum steps between states) as the metric to connect S and Z. This metric is invariant to state representations, allowing METRA to work directly from images. 

- By maximizing coverage in Z according to the temporal distance metric, METRA learns a diverse set of skills that approximately cover S.

- METRA is the first unsupervised RL method to discover diverse locomotion behaviors directly from images in complex domains like Quadruped and Humanoid.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing METRA, a novel unsupervised RL objective based on metric-aware abstraction, that enables scalable skill discovery in high-dimensional state spaces like images by covering a compact latent space metrically connected to the state space. METRA is shown to be the first method that can discover locomotion skills directly from pixels in complex environments.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in unsupervised reinforcement learning:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing the Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA) method for scalable unsupervised RL. METRA aims to learn a compact set of skills that maximally cover a latent space that is metrically connected to the state space through temporal distances. This is a novel approach compared to prior unsupervised RL methods.

- Most prior unsupervised RL work has focused on either pure exploration to cover the state space or unsupervised skill discovery based on mutual information maximization. As discussed in the paper, pure exploration methods struggle to scale to complex environments and MI-based skills often learn limited behaviors. METRA offers a distinct approach based on covering a compact metric latent space.

- Compared to other metric-based unsupervised skill discovery methods like WURL and LSD, METRA uses temporal distances rather than Euclidean distances. This makes it more applicable to high-dimensional pixel observations where Euclidean distance is not meaningful. Using temporal distances seems to be a key innovation for unsupervised RL in complex environments.

- The experiments demonstrate METRA succeeding at unsupervised locomotion skill discovery in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid environments. This is a first among unsupervised RL methods and shows METRA's ability to scale beyond what prior work has achieved.

- The idea of learning representations to preserve temporal distances relates METRA to some goal-conditioned RL methods. But METRA does this in an unsupervised manner and uses it for scalable skill discovery rather than goal-reaching.

Overall, METRA introduces a novel unsupervised RL objective based on covering a latent space connected to states by temporal distances. This approach appears more scalable than prior work, as evidenced by METRA's unprecedented results on complex pixel-based tasks. The temporal distance metric in particular seems crucial to METRA's advances over other unsupervised skill discovery techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving sample efficiency of METRA by combining it with recent advances in model-free RL (e.g. DrQ, REDQ, DROQ) or model-based RL (e.g. Dreamer, TD-MPC). The authors note that METRA currently uses a relatively simple RL algorithm (SAC) as the backbone, which leads to somewhat low sample efficiency. Integrating METRA with more advanced RL algorithms could improve this.

- Exploring more general variants of the Wasserstein dependency measure (WDM) objective, such as using the full objective in Eq 6 instead of the simplified version in Eq 10. The simplified WDM limits the diversity of discovered behaviors. The full WDM resembles contrastive learning and combining it with scalable contrastive learning techniques is suggested as an interesting direction.

- Using asymmetric quasimetrics instead of the symmetric Euclidean distance in the latent space to better capture asymmetric temporal distances. The current conservative embedding may be overly restrictive in highly asymmetric environments.

- Applying METRA to more complex observation spaces like proprioceptive states, multimodal sensory inputs, and demonstrations. The current experiments are mainly on visual observations.

- Combining unsupervised exploration and abstraction objectives to get the benefits of both pure exploration and scalable abstraction. 

- Theoretical analysis of METRA's abstraction capability and the effect of abstraction on downstream task learning.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving sample efficiency, exploring more general objectives, applying to more complex inputs, combining with exploration, and theoretical analysis. The key is pushing the scalability and generalization of unsupervised RL to even more complex domains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA), a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning method for learning useful behaviors without any supervision. Previous unsupervised RL methods either focus on pure exploration, which struggles to scale to complex environments, or skill discovery based on mutual information, which may fail to explore due to its metric-agnostic objective. METRA addresses these limitations by learning behaviors that maximize coverage of a compact latent space that is metrically connected to the state space through temporal distances. By covering all directions in this latent space, METRA obtains diverse behaviors that approximately span the state space, making it scalable. Through experiments on locomotion and manipulation tasks, including image-based domains, the authors demonstrate METRA's ability to discover varied, useful skills and outperform prior unsupervised RL techniques. Notably, METRA is the first method to learn locomotion behaviors in image-based Quadruped and Humanoid environments without any supervision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new unsupervised reinforcement learning method called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). The key idea is to learn a compact set of diverse skills that approximately cover the entire state space, rather than try to completely explore the full state space. This is done by learning skills that maximize coverage of a latent space that is metrically connected to the state space through temporal distances. Specifically, METRA optimizes an objective based on the Wasserstein dependency measure between states and skills, using the temporal distance between states as the metric. This forces the skills to move as far apart as possible in the latent space, leading to greater coverage of the actual state space. 

METRA is evaluated on complex locomotion and manipulation environments, including simulated robotics tasks with image observations. Experiments demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful skills and representations, even in high-dimensional pixel environments like quadruped and humanoid locomotion. The skills and representations learned by METRA also transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Compared to prior unsupervised RL methods based on exploration or mutual information, METRA exhibits superior exploration and downstream task performance. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach for scalable unsupervised skill discovery, with results suggesting METRA can learn behaviors and representations that are useful for solving tasks in complex, image-based environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) objective called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). The key idea is to learn a compact latent space that is metrically connected to the state space through temporal distances. Specifically, METRA optimizes a Wasserstein dependency measure between states and skills to maximize coverage in the latent space. This forces the learned skills to span long temporal distances in the state space. Rather than attempting to cover the entire state space, METRA focuses on the most "temporally spread-out" manifold that can be covered with the given latent space capacity. This allows METRA to scale to complex, high-dimensional environments like pixel-based control tasks. By learning skills that move maximally far apart in the compact latent space, METRA can discover a diverse set of behaviors that approximately cover the important subspaces of the original state space. The temporal distance metric allows METRA to be applied to raw pixel observations. Through experiments on various locomotion and manipulation tasks, the authors demonstrate METRA's ability to learn useful skills without any supervision, outperforming prior unsupervised RL techniques.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points are:

- The paper aims to develop a scalable unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) method that can enable agents to autonomously explore environments and discover useful behaviors, without any rewards or supervision. 

- Prior unsupervised RL methods have limitations in scaling to complex, high-dimensional environments. Pure exploration methods that try to cover the whole state space struggle as the state space grows very large. Unsupervised skill discovery methods based on mutual information (MI) often learn limited behaviors as MI is metric-agnostic. 

- To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new unsupervised RL objective called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). The key ideas are:

1) Learn behaviors that cover a compact latent space rather than the full state space. The latent space is connected to the state space by a metric.

2) Use temporal distances as the metric, which are invariant to state representations and scalable to pixels.

3) By covering the latent space, behaviors approximately cover the state space. This makes it tractable to learn in complex environments.

- Experiments show METRA can discover diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid environments, being the first unsupervised RL method to do so.

In summary, the paper aims to develop a scalable unsupervised RL method by learning behaviors that cover a compact, temporally-connected latent space, enabling exploration and skill discovery in complex high-dimensional environments.
