# [Have Faith in Faithfulness: Going Beyond Circuit Overlap When Finding   Model Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interpreting neural network models via "circuits", the minimal subgraphs that explain model behavior, is gaining popularity. But finding circuits via interventions scales poorly. 
- Prior work used the faster "Edge Attribution Patching (EAP)" method to find circuits, but didn't evaluate circuit faithfulness - whether ablating non-circuit components changes behavior.
- It's unclear if high overlap with true circuits implies faithfulness. Measuring overlap may give misleading conclusions about model mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "EAP with Integrated Gradients (EAP-IG)" to address cases where EAP fails due to flat loss gradients. EAP-IG sums gradients along path from corrupted to clean input, catching non-zero gradients.
- Compare circuits from EAP, EAP-IG and ground truth interventions on faithfulness across 6 tasks. 
- Study relationship between cross-task circuit overlap and faithfulness.

Main Contributions:
- EAP-IG finds more faithful circuits than EAP, but ground truth interventions still better on some tasks.
- Task pairs with moderate overlap have unpredictable faithfulness. Overlap does not imply faithfulness.  
- When comparing model mechanisms across tasks using circuits, measuring faithfulness is more indicative than measuring overlap.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the importance of evaluating faithfulness when using circuits to explain and compare model behaviors across tasks. The proposed EAP-IG method finds more faithful circuits than prior EAP method. But circuit overlap should not be used as sole evidence of shared task mechanisms without also checking faithfulness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called edge attribution patching with integrated gradients (EAP-IG) that finds more faithful circuits than prior methods, and shows empirically that circuit overlap does not always imply circuit faithfulness across tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1) Proposing a new method called "edge attribution patching with integrated gradients" (EAP-IG) for finding model circuits that are more faithful than those found by the existing EAP method. EAP-IG combines EAP with integrated gradients to address issues like flat loss gradients that can cause EAP to miss important edges.

2) Empirically evaluating and comparing the faithfulness of circuits found by EAP, EAP-IG, and ground truth activation patching across 6 different tasks. The experiments show EAP-IG tends to find more faithful circuits than regular EAP, though activation patching still sometimes performs best.

3) Analyzing the relationship between circuit overlap and faithfulness, using both within-task and cross-task scenarios. The key finding is that when circuit overlaps are moderate, overlap does not necessarily predict faithfulness well. The authors conclude that faithfulness, not overlap, should be the metric used when comparing model mechanisms.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating a new technique for finding more faithful circuits, and using this to demonstrate that circuit overlap does not always imply circuit faithfulness, which has implications for how circuits are compared across tasks and models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Circuits framework - A set of techniques for interpreting neural network models by finding minimal computational subgraphs ("circuits") that explain model behavior on specific tasks.

- Faithfulness - A core property of circuits stating that ablating all model components outside the circuit should not change the model's performance on the task that circuit explains. Faithfulness justifies studying circuits. 

- Edge attribution patching (EAP) - A method for efficiently approximating the effects of interventions on model edges to find circuits. Scales better than manual interventions but may find less faithful circuits.

- Integrated gradients (IG) - An attribution method that addresses issues like zero gradients by accumulating gradients along the path from baseline to input. Used to improve EAP. 

- Edge attribution patching with integrated gradients (EAP-IG) - A new circuit finding method combining EAP and IG that finds more faithful circuits than EAP alone.

- Overlap vs faithfulness - High overlap between circuits does not necessarily imply high cross-task faithfulness. When comparing model mechanisms across tasks, faithfulness is more indicative than overlap.

The key focus areas are developing more faithful and efficient circuit finding techniques, and understanding the relationship between circuit overlap and faithfulness across tasks and models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes EAP-IG as an improvement over EAP for finding more faithful circuits. What is the key insight behind EAP-IG that allows it to find more faithful circuits compared to EAP?

2. EAP-IG incorporates ideas from integrated gradients for input attribution. How does the formulation of integrated gradients help address some of the limitations of EAP identified in the paper?

3. The paper argues that faithfulness, not overlap, should be the key criteria for evaluating circuit finding methods. Why is faithfulness a better metric than overlap for this purpose according to the authors?

4. The paper investigates the relationship between overlap and faithfulness across tasks. What were the key findings regarding whether overlap implies faithfulness in the cross-task setting?

5. The experiments show mixed results when comparing EAP-IG circuits to those found by activation patching. For which tasks does EAP-IG match or exceed activation patching and why might this be the case?

6. How many forward/backward passes are needed for EAP-IG to find faithful circuits? Does this represent a reasonable computational overhead compared to EAP in practice?

7. While focused on faithfulness, does EAP-IG also show improvements over EAP in terms of recovering nodes/edges of reference circuits?

8. For tasks where EAP-IG outperforms EAP, what differences were observed between EAP and EAP-IG in terms of correlation with activation patching scores?

9. The paper argues EAP-IG allows the use of loss functions like KL divergence for more tasks. Why does EAP not easily permit the use of KL divergence and how does EAP-IG overcome this?

10. How well do the findings showing EAP-IG outperforming EAP hold when evaluated in larger language models? Do the same failure cases of EAP tend to manifest?
