# [Have Faith in Faithfulness: Going Beyond Circuit Overlap When Finding   Model Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interpreting neural network models via "circuits", the minimal subgraphs that explain model behavior, is gaining popularity. But finding circuits via interventions scales poorly. 
- Prior work used the faster "Edge Attribution Patching (EAP)" method to find circuits, but didn't evaluate circuit faithfulness - whether ablating non-circuit components changes behavior.
- It's unclear if high overlap with true circuits implies faithfulness. Measuring overlap may give misleading conclusions about model mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "EAP with Integrated Gradients (EAP-IG)" to address cases where EAP fails due to flat loss gradients. EAP-IG sums gradients along path from corrupted to clean input, catching non-zero gradients.
- Compare circuits from EAP, EAP-IG and ground truth interventions on faithfulness across 6 tasks. 
- Study relationship between cross-task circuit overlap and faithfulness.

Main Contributions:
- EAP-IG finds more faithful circuits than EAP, but ground truth interventions still better on some tasks.
- Task pairs with moderate overlap have unpredictable faithfulness. Overlap does not imply faithfulness.  
- When comparing model mechanisms across tasks using circuits, measuring faithfulness is more indicative than measuring overlap.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the importance of evaluating faithfulness when using circuits to explain and compare model behaviors across tasks. The proposed EAP-IG method finds more faithful circuits than prior EAP method. But circuit overlap should not be used as sole evidence of shared task mechanisms without also checking faithfulness.
