# [Learning Foresightful Dense Visual Affordance for Deformable Object   Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11057)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop methods for deformable object manipulation that can accomplish multi-step tasks smoothly by avoiding getting stuck in local optima. The key ideas proposed in the paper to address this question are:1) Using dense visual affordance to represent policies for picking and placing actions on deformable objects. Dense affordance can capture the complex states and dynamics of deformable objects.2) Estimating a 'value' for each state that represents how good it is for accomplishing the full multi-step task. This allows avoiding locally optimal states that may hinder later steps. 3) A framework to learn the proposed foresightful dense affordance representations efficiently in a self-supervised way, without needing expert demonstrations. This includes multi-stage training and a data collection method using reversed task completion.4) Integrating the learned affordance modules into a full system and adapting them using online data.Through experiments on cloth unfolding and rope manipulation tasks, they demonstrate that the proposed ideas lead to improved performance on multi-step deformable object manipulation compared to prior imitation learning and reinforcement learning methods.
