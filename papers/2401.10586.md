# [PuriDefense: Randomized Local Implicit Adversarial Purification for   Defending Black-box Query-based Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Black-box query-based attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning systems by generating adversarial examples to fool models without accessing their internal details. Traditional defenses like adversarial training or input transformations are often computationally expensive for large-scale deployment. There is a need for an efficient and lightweight defense mechanism against such attacks.  

Proposed Solution - PuriDefense:
The paper proposes PuriDefense, a novel defense approach using randomized patch-wise image purifications with an ensemble of lightweight models based on local implicit functions. Key ideas:

1) Use multiple purifier models leveraging local implicit functions to project adversarial images back onto the natural image manifold by reconstructing perturbed patches.

2) Introduce randomness into purifications through randomized assignment of purifiers to patches instead of direct ensemble of purifiers, enhancing diversity without increasing inference costs.

3) Theoretical analysis shows randomized purifications slow down convergence of query-based attacks by obscuring gradient estimations. Robustness scales with number of purifiers without raising inference costs.


Main Contributions:

1) Proposes PuriDefense - first defense utilizing local implicit functions against query-based attacks with theoretical guarantees. 

2) Establishes how deterministic transformations may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities, proving need for randomness in purifications.

3) Achieves high robustness against 5 SOTA attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while maintaining accuracy on clean images.

4) Demonstrates 4x faster inference than prior works with robustness and costs invariant to number of purifiers.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in designing an efficient randomized purification defense against query-based adversarial attacks with both theoretical and empirical validation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes PuriDefense, a novel defense mechanism against black-box query-based adversarial attacks that uses an ensemble of lightweight neural network purifiers operating randomly on local image patches to purify adversarial perturbations while maintaining low computational cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel defense mechanism called PuriDefense that uses random patch-wise image purification with local implicit functions to defend against query-based adversarial attacks. This is the first work to extend local implicit functions to defend against query-based attacks.

2. Providing theoretical analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of the defense and shows that the robustness scales with the number of purifiers used. The analysis also reveals vulnerabilities of deterministic purifications to query-based attacks. 

3. Validating the method through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets against state-of-the-art query-based attacks. The results demonstrate significant improvements in robustness while maintaining low computational costs.

4. Integrating PuriDefense with adversarially trained models to further enhance robustness and set new benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and effective defense mechanism called PuriDefense that leverages randomness in patch-wise purifications to defend against query-based attacks, with both theoretical and empirical validation of its capabilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Black-box attacks - The threat model considered where the attacker has limited knowledge of the target model's architecture and parameters. This includes query-based attacks.

- Query-based attacks - Attacks where the attacker can query the model to obtain outputs and use that to construct adversarial examples. This includes both score-based and decision-based attacks.

- Adversarial purification - Defensive techniques that aim to remove or reduce adversarial perturbations from inputs before feeding them into the model. 

- Local implicit functions - Used to design efficient purification models that can project adversarial inputs back onto the natural image manifold.

- Randomized patch-wise purification - The proposed defense method that randomly assigns purifiers from an ensemble to local patches, introducing diversity while maintaining cost. 

- Inference cost - An important consideration for real-world defense methods. Needs to be low to enable deployment.

- Convergence of attacks - Analyzed theoretically to show how deterministic vs. randomized purifications impact robustness against query-based attacks.

So in summary, key terms cover query-based attacks, adversarial purification defenses, use of randomization and local implicit functions, analyzing convergence, and practical considerations like cost.
