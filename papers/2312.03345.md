## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GraNet, a multi-level graph network framework for 6-DOF grasp pose generation in cluttered scenes. The core innovation is constructing graphs at the scene, object, and grasp point levels to enhance multi-scale spatial reasoning for grasping. The pipeline first uses an attention-based graph network to embed geometric features from the scene point cloud. It then strategically selects grasp point locations using a learning approach rather than uniform sampling. This binds the feature extraction with the grasping task for better convergence. Multi-level graphs are built after each grasp point selection stage, creating a cascading focus effect towards ideal grasps. Comparative experiments on GraspNet-1Billion show state-of-the-art performance, especially on novel objects (+11.62% AP). The method also demonstrates a high 84.2% success rate when grasping novel objects in real robotic experiments. The multi-graph hierarchy and deep integration of the grasping objective are the main innovations that empower GraNet with superior understanding of spatial distributions for feasible grasps.
