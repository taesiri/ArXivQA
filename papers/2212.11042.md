# [Hi-LASSIE: High-Fidelity Articulated Shape and Skeleton Discovery from   Sparse Image Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11042)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D articulated shapes from sparse in-the-wild image ensembles, without relying on dense temporal correspondence, large-scale datasets, or manual annotations. The key hypothesis is that it is possible to automatically discover a generic 3D skeleton from a sparse image ensemble, and use this to guide the joint optimization of camera viewpoints, skeleton articulations, and part shapes for each instance. This approach could enable high-quality 3D reconstruction from just 20-30 online images.The main contributions are:1) A method to automatically discover a class-specific 3D skeleton from a reference image, using 2D geometry and deep semantic features. 2) Novel instance-specific optimization strategies, including frequency decomposition of part shapes, high-resolution part rendering, and surface feature MLPs. These aim to produce detailed and instance-specific shapes while preserving shared priors.3) Demonstrating state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on sparse in-the-wild animal images, with less manual input than prior work. The explicit part representation also enables applications like animation and motion retargeting.In summary, the key hypothesis is that joint 3D skeleton discovery and instance-specific optimization can enable high-fidelity articulated shape reconstruction from minimal supervision, which is evaluated on animal image ensembles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing Hi-LASSIE, a technique for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D articulated shapes from sparse image ensembles without any 2D/3D annotations or templates. - Automatically discovering the 3D skeleton from a single reference image, which removes the need for manual 3D skeleton templates.- Designing novel optimization strategies like frequency-based part decomposition, zoomed-in part rendering, and surface feature MLPs to capture instance-specific shape details while preserving shared shape priors.- Achieving state-of-the-art reconstructions on Pascal-Part and LASSIE datasets compared to prior arts, despite using minimal user input.- Enabling various applications like shape animation and motion re-targeting by representing the output as an articulated 3D part-based model.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Hi-LASSIE to automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D articulated shapes from sparse image collections without any manually defined shape or skeleton templates. This is achieved by novel techniques for 3D skeleton discovery and instance-specific shape optimization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Hi-LASSIE, a method to automatically estimate high-fidelity 3D skeleton, shape, camera viewpoints, and articulations for articulated objects like animals from sparse sets of online images, without requiring dense image correspondences, shape templates, or manual annotations like 2D keypoints or camera poses.
