# [Presenting Terrorizer: an algorithm for consolidating company names in   patent assignees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of disambiguating and harmonizing company names in patent data. Specifically, companies often file patents under multiple name variations (e.g. abbreviations, subsidiaries, alternate spellings). This creates significant challenges in accurately attributing patents to companies and can bias research outcomes that rely on patent data.   

Proposed Solution - Terrorizer Algorithm
The paper proposes a new algorithm called "Terrorizer" to consolidate company names in patent data. The key aspects are:

1) Parsing Stage: 
- Knowledge augmentation - Uses a web crawler to extract correct spellings and additional information on company names from search engine results. This allows handling of spelling mistakes and very different name variants.

- Cleaning - Preprocesses names by lowercasing, removing punctuation/spaces, deleting common legal entity extensions.

2) Matching Stage:
- Compares each pair of names and computes a similarity score based on: token overlap, matching first token, domain name overlap, cosine similarity of name embeddings.

3) Filtering Stage:  
- Forms communities of names using network theory and Louvain algorithm. Refines communities by removing inter-community name links.
- Names communities by picking most representative name based on average embedding similarity.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel approach by combining NLP, network theory and rule-based techniques for company name disambiguation in patents. 
- Introduces innovative stages such as knowledge augmentation using web searches and community detection based filtering.
- Evaluates algorithm on 4 gold standard datasets and shows improved performance over prior art, especially for legal entity/subsidiary matching.
- Reduces number of company names in USPTO patent data by 42\% through extensive experiments.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in entity resolution for patent data by harnessing modern NLP and network theory advancements. The Terrorizer algorithm and techniques could benefit patent analytics and related research areas that rely on accurately attributing patents to companies.
