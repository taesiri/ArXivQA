# [Enhancing the Performance of DeepReach on High-Dimensional Systems   through Optimizing Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a useful formal verification method to provide safety guarantees for dynamical systems. However, traditional grid-based methods for computing reachable sets scale exponentially with dimensionality, limiting applicability. DeepReach uses a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the value function and overcome the curse of dimensionality. But accurately learning high-dimensional value functions remains challenging. 

Approach:
This paper explores using different combinations of sinusoidal and ReLU activations in DeepReach's DNN to balance derivative approximation accuracy and optimization difficulty. The key ideas are:

1) Intertwine sinusoidal and ReLU layers in the DNN to leverage both accurate gradients from sinusoid and easier optimization of ReLU.

2) Experiment with different arrangements and numbers of sinusoidal layers to find the best performing activation structure.

3) Propose using violation rate and Î´-level metrics to quantitatively evaluate quality of computed reachable sets, especially for high-dimensional systems lacking ground truth.

Experiments: 
The approach is evaluated on a 3D system (proof of concept) and a 9D vehicle collision avoidance system. Different intertwined activation structures are tested. Quantitative metrics based on violation rates are computed to compare reachable set quality.

Results: 
More sinusoid layers improve accuracy but increase training time. Activation choices for first/last layers dominate performance over middle layers. One structure reduced 9D violation rate from 19% to 18.43% by adding a sinusoid layer.

Contributions:
1) First exploration of intertwined activation functions in DeepReach to balance tradeoffs.
2) Quantitative evaluation metrics for high-dimensional reachable sets.
3) Analysis relating activation structure and reachable set quality on up to 9D systems.

The paper makes good progress towards enhancing DeepReach's performance on high-dimensional systems through optimizing neural network activations. The proposed evaluation metrics also facilitate more systematic analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores enhancing the performance of DeepReach, a deep learning approach for high-dimensional reachability analysis, on complex systems by comparing different combinations of sinusoidal and ReLU activation functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is exploring different combinations of sinusoidal and ReLU activation functions in the neural network architecture of DeepReach to improve its performance in approximating high-dimensional reachable sets. Specifically, the authors:

1) Conducted experiments on 3D and 9D systems using different arrangements of sinusoidal and ReLU activations. They found correlations between number of sinusoidal layers and DeepReach's accuracy.

2) Discovered that choice of activation functions on the first and last layers has a dominant effect on DeepReach's performance. Using sinusoidal on first and last provides lower violation rates compared to other arrangements.  

3) Improved the violation rate on a 9D system from 19.0% (all sinusoidal baseline) to 18.43% by using one additional sinusoidal layer. This indicates adding more sinusoidal layers can enhance DeepReach's approximation of high-dimensional reachability problems.

In summary, the key contribution is providing an empirical analysis on how different activations impact DeepReach, and showing that tailored combinations of sinusoidal and ReLU can improve performance on high-dimensional systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis: A mathematical framework to obtain the backward reachable tube (BRT) of dynamical systems. Formulated as an optimal control problem and converted into solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

- DeepReach: A deep learning-based method to approximate the value function for high-dimensional reachability problems using a deep neural network. Scaling better than traditional grid-based methods.

- Activation Functions: Different choices of activation functions in the neural network architecture impact performance and training time. Tradeoff between accurate gradient representation (sine) and easier optimization (ReLU).

- Backward Reachable Tube (BRT): The set of states from which the system can be steered to a target set within a time horizon while minimizing a cost function. Computed using the value function.  

- High-dimensional systems: Traditional BRT solvers struggle with curse of dimensionality. DeepReach tries to overcome this by using a neural network.

- Violation rate: Metric to quantitatively evaluate accuracy of computed BRTs by sampling states and generating trajectories to check for violations.

Some other terms: dynamical systems, optimal control, level set method, deep neural network, optimization, disturbances, system dynamics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a combination of sinusoidal and ReLU activation functions in the neural network used by DeepReach. What is the intuition behind this proposed approach? How does it balance computational efficiency and accuracy in approximating the value function?

2. The paper experiments with different arrangements of sinusoidal and ReLU layers (e.g. ssrsl, rrrsl). What patterns do you see in how the arrangement impacts training time and accuracy? Why do you think certain arrangements perform better? 

3. For the 9D vehicle collision example, the paper uses the union of pairwise BRTs as an approximation to compare against. What are the limitations of this approximation? How could you quantify accuracy without an analytical ground truth?

4. The violation rate is used as one metric to evaluate the quality of the computed BRTs. What are the limitations of using the violation rate? How could the violation rate fail to accurately reflect the true quality of the BRT?  

5. What future experiments could you run to further analyze the impact of different activation function arrangements? For example, how would results differ for a 12D system compared to the 9D system tested?

6. The paper hypothesizes the choice of activation functions on the first and last layers has a dominant effect. How would you test this hypothesis more rigorously? What control experiments could isolate the impact of the first and last layers?

7. Could the optimal arrangement of activation functions depend on properties of the dynamical system like dimensionality or complexity? How would you test whether the results generalize across systems?  

8. The DeepReach network has a fixed architecture in these experiments (3 hidden layers with 512 nodes). How sensitive could the results be to changes in network width or depth? 

9. The paper focuses on combinations of sinusoidal and ReLU activations. What other activation functions would be worth exploring? How might you adapt the analysis for other activation choices?

10. The results show adding more sinusoidal layers continues improving accuracy, though likely at the cost of training time. What analysis could determine the optimal tradeoff point between accuracy and training efficiency?
