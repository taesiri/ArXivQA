# [Average-Case Analysis of Iterative Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08144)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the convergence rate of certain summations involving binomial random variables. Specifically, it examines summations like:
$\sum_{k=\floor{np}}^{n} \left( \frac{k-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}} \right) g(k) \Pr(S_n = k)^2$
where $S_n \sim \text{Bin}(n,p)$ and $g(k)$ is a bounded function. 

- These types of summations arise when analyzing smoothing properties of binomial random variables. However, directly analyzing their convergence is challenging due to:
   1) The squared binomial probability term
   2) The standardized binomial random variable $x_{n,k} = \frac{k-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ in the summation
   3) Possible non-integer value of $np$

Proposed Solution:
- Replace binomial probability with discretized Gaussian probability using Petrov's theorem
- Carefully partition summation ranges and make use of properties of the $g(k)$ term 
- Employ squeeze theorem with meticulously constructed bounds 
- Perform change of variables to create symmetry in the summation

Main Contributions:
- Provides a framework and techniques to analyze convergence of tricky binomial-related summations
- Demonstrates how to handle issues that arise due to squared probability term, standardization, and non-integer parameters
- Establishes asymptotic convergence rates for key summations that have applications in smoothed analysis of binomial random variables

The technical contributions include carefully constructed proofs involving partitioning, bounding, change of variables, and more. Multiple supporting lemmas are also proved regarding behavior of certain terms. Overall, it develops a methodology to tackle difficult summations that can enable further analysis in related problems.
