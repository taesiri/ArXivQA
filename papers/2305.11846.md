# [Any-to-Any Generation via Composable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11846)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an AI system capable of flexible and composable generation across multiple modalities, including text, image, video and audio? Specifically, the paper introduces Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model aimed at achieving "any-to-any" generation between any combinations of the text, image, video and audio modalities. For example, generating video and synchronized audio from text prompts, or generating images from audio and text inputs. The key challenges addressed are:1) Training a model to handle exponential combinations of input and output modalities, when training data for many modality combinations may be scarce. 2) Enabling high-quality synchronized generation of intertwined output modalities like video and aligned audio.3) Maintaining strong performance on single-modality generation while adding multi-modality capabilities.To tackle these challenges, the central hypothesis appears to be:By aligning representations across modalities, both at the input conditioning stage and output generation stage, a model can learn to process and generate any combination of modalities without directly training on all possible input-output pairs.So in summary, the central research question is how to develop an AI system for flexible multi-modality generation, and the key hypothesis is that cross-modality alignment of representations can enable this capability. The CoDi model and training techniques are proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a novel generative model called Composable Diffusion (CoDi). The main contribution is that CoDi can simultaneously generate any combination of modalities like text, image, video, and audio both from any combination of input modalities. Some key aspects:- CoDi can generate multiple modalities in parallel. This is more flexible than existing generative AI systems that are often limited to certain input-output combinations (e.g. text-to-image).- CoDi uses a composable and integrative design. It first trains strong unimodal latent diffusion models, then enables cross-modal attention for joint generation.- It employs techniques like "Bridging Alignment" and "Latent Alignment" to efficiently align representations across modalities, reducing the training complexity from exponential to linear in the number of modalities.- CoDi demonstrates high-quality generation capacity across diverse settings: single-to-single modality, multi-conditioning, and joint generation of multiple synchronized outputs.- It achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on unimodal tasks, while enabling novel joint generation capabilities not possible before.In summary, the main contribution is proposing CoDi, the first AI model capable of flexible any-to-any multimodal generation through innovations in model architecture, training strategies, and modality alignment techniques. This greatly expands the flexibility and scope of generative models.
