# [Any-to-Any Generation via Composable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11846)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an AI system capable of flexible and composable generation across multiple modalities, including text, image, video and audio? Specifically, the paper introduces Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model aimed at achieving "any-to-any" generation between any combinations of the text, image, video and audio modalities. For example, generating video and synchronized audio from text prompts, or generating images from audio and text inputs. The key challenges addressed are:1) Training a model to handle exponential combinations of input and output modalities, when training data for many modality combinations may be scarce. 2) Enabling high-quality synchronized generation of intertwined output modalities like video and aligned audio.3) Maintaining strong performance on single-modality generation while adding multi-modality capabilities.To tackle these challenges, the central hypothesis appears to be:By aligning representations across modalities, both at the input conditioning stage and output generation stage, a model can learn to process and generate any combination of modalities without directly training on all possible input-output pairs.So in summary, the central research question is how to develop an AI system for flexible multi-modality generation, and the key hypothesis is that cross-modality alignment of representations can enable this capability. The CoDi model and training techniques are proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a novel generative model called Composable Diffusion (CoDi). The main contribution is that CoDi can simultaneously generate any combination of modalities like text, image, video, and audio both from any combination of input modalities. Some key aspects:- CoDi can generate multiple modalities in parallel. This is more flexible than existing generative AI systems that are often limited to certain input-output combinations (e.g. text-to-image).- CoDi uses a composable and integrative design. It first trains strong unimodal latent diffusion models, then enables cross-modal attention for joint generation.- It employs techniques like "Bridging Alignment" and "Latent Alignment" to efficiently align representations across modalities, reducing the training complexity from exponential to linear in the number of modalities.- CoDi demonstrates high-quality generation capacity across diverse settings: single-to-single modality, multi-conditioning, and joint generation of multiple synchronized outputs.- It achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on unimodal tasks, while enabling novel joint generation capabilities not possible before.In summary, the main contribution is proposing CoDi, the first AI model capable of flexible any-to-any multimodal generation through innovations in model architecture, training strategies, and modality alignment techniques. This greatly expands the flexibility and scope of generative models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other recent research on multimodal generative AI models:- Unlike many existing models that can generate one modality from another (e.g. text-to-image, text-to-audio), this paper proposes a model, Composable Diffusion (CoDi), that can generate any combination of modalities (image, video, audio, text) from any combination of input modalities. This flexible any-to-any generation capacity is novel.- The paper utilizes latent diffusion models (LDMs) as the backbone architecture for each modality, which have shown strong results recently for image and audio generation. The use of LDMs provides a strong starting point.- To enable multimodal conditioning and generation, the paper proposes alignment strategies ("bridging alignment" and "latent alignment") to map different modalities into shared spaces. This allows flexible recombination and attending between modalities.- The model is designed and trained in an integrative way, combining large-scale unimodal pretraining with additional multimodal objectives. This provides a pragmatic strategy to leverage diverse training data.- Experiments demonstrate CoDi's ability to generate high-quality outputs for both unimodal and multimodal settings. The results are competitive with or superior to recent state-of-the-art models for text, image, audio and video generation tasks.- One limitation is that evaluation of joint multimodal generation quality remains a challenge, as discussed in the paper. More standardized evaluation protocols would be useful.Overall, the proposed CoDi model makes significant advances in flexible multimodal generative modeling. The composable architecture and pragmatic training approach effectively harness diverse data resources. If the societal concerns around synthetic media generation can be appropriately addressed, models like CoDi could enable more naturalistic and engaging human-AI interactions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more advanced joint training techniques to model interactions and dependencies between different modalities more effectively. The current bridging alignment and latent alignment strategies in CoDi are still fairly simple. More sophisticated methods could better capture cross-modal relationships and lead to more coherent joint generation.- Exploring different model architectures and objectives for multimodal diffusion models. The authors used standard UNet architectures in CoDi but propose investigating things like cascading models and adversarial training.- Extending the framework to support additional modalities beyond text, image, video and audio. For example, 3D shapes, graphs, tactile signals, etc.- Improving sample efficiency and reducing the computational requirements of training. Modeling all combinations of modalities leads to an exponential increase in training objectives. More efficient training is needed.- Enhancing control over the generation process, such as controlling the style and content of different modalities independently.- Developing better evaluation metrics and benchmarks for joint multimodal generation tasks, since current metrics are limited.- Studying social impacts and potential negative uses of controllable multimodal generative models, and developing appropriate safeguards.In summary, the key directions are developing more advanced joint modeling techniques, supporting more modalities, improving efficiency and control, creating better evaluation methods, and considering societal impacts. The authors propose CoDi as an important early step towards comprehensive multimodal generative AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model capable of generating any combination of output modalities, such as language, image, video, or audio, from any combination of input modalities. CoDi employs latent diffusion models for each modality which are trained in parallel. To enable conditional cross-modality generation, the input modalities are projected into a shared feature space and the output LDM attends to the combination of input features. CoDi's key innovation is enabling the model to generate multiple modalities in parallel through a composable generation strategy. This involves building a shared multimodal latent space by bridging alignment in the diffusion process, allowing synchronized generation of intertwined modalities like video and audio. Experiments demonstrate CoDi's flexible generation capabilities across diverse scenarios, including generating synchronized video and audio from text prompts. The model exhibits strong quality on both joint-modality and single-modality synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model capable of generating any combination of output modalities, such as language, image, video, or audio, from any combination of input modalities. CoDi employs diffusion models to generate high-quality outputs for each modality. To enable conditioning on arbitrary combinations of modalities, the paper proposes aligning prompt encoders of different modalities using "bridging alignment", where text is used as a bridge modality. For joint generation of multiple modalities, CoDi incorporates cross-attention between the diffusion models and aligns their latent representations. This allows CoDi to generate synchronized outputs like video and audio without direct training. Through composable training objectives and sharing, CoDi achieves any-to-any generation capability with a linear number of training objectives.Experiments demonstrate CoDi's ability to perform both single and joint generation of text, image, audio and video. It achieves strong performance on tasks like image and audio generation, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art models. CoDi also shows coherent joint generation ability, like creating video with synchronized audio from only text prompts. The proposed composable diffusion approach enables training and generating using any arbitrary combination of modalities, despite limited training data. This makes CoDi uniquely capable of comprehensive multimodal generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model that is capable of generating any combination of modalities such as text, image, video, or audio from any input modality or combination of modalities. CoDi employs latent diffusion models (LDMs) for each individual modality which are first trained separately. To enable cross-modality generation, the input modalities are aligned and projected into a shared feature space through a bridging alignment strategy. The output LDM can then attend to the combination of aligned input features. To generate multiple modalities in parallel, cross-attention modules are added to each LDM diffuser and an environment encoder aligns the latent variables into a shared space. This allows the LDMs to cross-attend to any group of co-generated modalities by interpolating their aligned latent representations. The composable conditioning and generation modules of CoDi reduce the exponential training objective space to a linear one, making it feasible to train a system for any-to-any generation without requiring data for every input-output combination.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to build an AI system capable of flexibly generating and processing multiple modalities, including text, images, video, and audio. Specifically, the paper notes that most current generative AI models are limited in only being able to generate a single modality from a specific type of input (e.g. text-to-image, or text-to-audio). However, real-world data consists of multiple interacting modalities. The authors argue that developing a model that can handle any-to-any generation across modalities is important for more accurately capturing multimodal data distributions, seamlessly consolidating diverse information, and enabling more engaging and immersive human-AI interactions.To achieve this, the paper proposes a novel generative model called Composable Diffusion (CoDi) that can take any combination of modalities as input and generate any combination of modalities as output. The key technical questions addressed are:- How to align representations of different modalities to enable flexible conditioning and generation. This is done through techniques like "Bridging Alignment" and "Latent Alignment".- How to train the model efficiently without needing exponentially many training objectives for all input-output combinations. The composable conditioning and generation strategies reduce the required objectives to linear. - How to integrate modality-specific sub-models and train in an end-to-end manner while maintaining strong individual modality quality.In summary, the core problem is building an AI system for flexible multimodal generation, which requires solving challenges around representation alignment, efficient training, and composable model architecture.
