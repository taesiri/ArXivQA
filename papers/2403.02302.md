# [Beyond Specialization: Assessing the Capabilities of MLLMs in Age and   Gender Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper explores whether powerful general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaVA, and ShareGPT can match or exceed specialized models designed specifically for facial age and gender estimation tasks. 

- It compares the latest specialized model MiVOLO v2 against leading MLLMs on various benchmarks to understand their capabilities and limitations in replacing specialized CV models.

Methodology
- Experiments were conducted on multiple datasets: LAGENDA, IMDB-clean, Adience etc. Both facial and full body images were evaluated where possible.

- MLLMs were tested in their default configuration and also after task-specific fine-tuning on age/gender data. The best fine-tuned model used ShareGPT4V architecture.  

- The same prompt was used to get predictions from all models. Additional steps like setting temperature=0 were taken to ensure deterministic results.

Key Results
- Without tuning, ChatGPT4V performed the best at age estimation among MLLMs, but still below specialized MiVOLOv2 model. Fine-tuned ShareGPT4V exceeded MiVOLO on some metrics.

- All MLLMs were very effective at gender classification without any tuning, above the specialized model's performance. But ChatGPT4V had some failure cases.

- With larger datasets, task-specific fine-tuning transformed ShareGPT4V into the overall best model surpassing MiVOLOv2 on most metrics.

- However, MiVOLOv2 retains advantages of specialization - more stable on corner cases, faster/cheaper inferences. But fine-tuned MLLMs offer simplicity and flexibility.

Main Conclusions
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced MLLMs on specialized facial analysis tasks, presenting them as potential alternatives to niche CV models in many practical applications. However, computational constraints remain a barrier currently.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models to a specialized model for age and gender estimation on various benchmarks, finding that while the specialized model still leads on core metrics, fine-tuned LLMs can achieve competitive results, suggesting versatile neural networks may replace specialized models in some applications where inference speed is less critical.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Comparing the capabilities of cutting-edge specialized models (MiVOLO) versus general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaVA, and ShareGPT for facial age and gender estimation tasks.

2) Showing that with no or minimal fine-tuning, MLLMs can match or exceed the performance of specialized models on these tasks, demonstrating their versatility. However, specialized models may still outperform on some datasets/metrics.

3) Fine-tuning the ShareGPT model on an age estimation dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to prior specialized and non-fine-tuned MLLMs. This shows the potential for using fine-tuned MLLMs in applications where computational cost is not the primary concern.

4) Providing updated benchmarks and comparisons of multiple MLLMs on several age estimation datasets (LAGENDA, IMDB-clean, etc.) and analysis of strengths/weaknesses of the different approaches.

5) Introducing an improved version of the specialized MiVOLO model (MiVOLOv2) which establishes new state-of-the-art results for specialized models on the tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive comparison and analysis of capabilities of generalist MLLMs versus specialized models for age and gender estimation, including fine-tuning experiments to achieve state-of-the-art results with an MLLM.
