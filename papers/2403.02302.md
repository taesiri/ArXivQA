# [Beyond Specialization: Assessing the Capabilities of MLLMs in Age and   Gender Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper explores whether powerful general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaVA, and ShareGPT can match or exceed specialized models designed specifically for facial age and gender estimation tasks. 

- It compares the latest specialized model MiVOLO v2 against leading MLLMs on various benchmarks to understand their capabilities and limitations in replacing specialized CV models.

Methodology
- Experiments were conducted on multiple datasets: LAGENDA, IMDB-clean, Adience etc. Both facial and full body images were evaluated where possible.

- MLLMs were tested in their default configuration and also after task-specific fine-tuning on age/gender data. The best fine-tuned model used ShareGPT4V architecture.  

- The same prompt was used to get predictions from all models. Additional steps like setting temperature=0 were taken to ensure deterministic results.

Key Results
- Without tuning, ChatGPT4V performed the best at age estimation among MLLMs, but still below specialized MiVOLOv2 model. Fine-tuned ShareGPT4V exceeded MiVOLO on some metrics.

- All MLLMs were very effective at gender classification without any tuning, above the specialized model's performance. But ChatGPT4V had some failure cases.

- With larger datasets, task-specific fine-tuning transformed ShareGPT4V into the overall best model surpassing MiVOLOv2 on most metrics.

- However, MiVOLOv2 retains advantages of specialization - more stable on corner cases, faster/cheaper inferences. But fine-tuned MLLMs offer simplicity and flexibility.

Main Conclusions
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced MLLMs on specialized facial analysis tasks, presenting them as potential alternatives to niche CV models in many practical applications. However, computational constraints remain a barrier currently.
