# [A Data-Driven Framework for Improving Public EV Charging Infrastructure:   Modeling and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement and Motivation:
- With rapid growth in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, existing EV charging infrastructure is struggling to meet charging demands. Current ad-hoc strategies for expanding infrastructure are inadequate. 
- Lack of suitable quality-of-experience (QoE) metrics makes it difficult for operators to assess performance of charging stations (EVCSs) and optimize them.
- Existing global metrics like EV-to-charger ratio (EVCR) and per-EV charger power (EVCP) hide important factors affecting QoE such as non-uniform EV adoption trends, location-specific constraints, and disparate charging demands across sites.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate new data-driven QoE metrics for individual EVCS assessment: site utilization, occupancy, idleness probability and blocking probability.
- Build an M/G/k queuing simulator using realistic HQ data to estimate number of delayed EVs and average waiting times.
- Develop a SARIMAX forecasting model leveraging historical EV charging data and external factors to predict future long-term charging loads.

Key Contributions:
- First data-driven framework to evaluate per-EVCS QoE metrics tailored to provide visibility into utilization and dynamics.
- Custom built discrete-event simulator estimates delays and waiting times to quantify consumer-perceived QoE.  
- SARIMAX model exploits trends and seasonality in historical data for accurate 1-year ahead EVCS load forecasting.
- Study of 14 representative sites proves current infrastructure inadequate. Proposed solution used to recommend optimal EVCS expansions to meet rising demands.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in QoE metrics, simulation and forecasting to help operators better plan and expand EV charging infrastructure. The data-driven techniques aim to maintain acceptable consumer QoE in the face of rapidly rising EV adoption worldwide.
