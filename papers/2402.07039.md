# [Coordinated Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current AI harm reporting operates on an ad hoc basis, lacking structured processes for disclosing or addressing algorithmic flaws. In contrast, software security relies on robust Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) processes.
- Machine learning (ML) models have unique properties compared to traditional software, warranting a specialized disclosure framework. ML issues involve statistical validity thresholds and often extend beyond security to encompass trustworthiness and bias.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a tailored "Coordinated Flaw Disclosure" (CFD) framework for ML/AI systems to formalize the recognition of valid model issues.
- Core components of CFD include:
  - Extended model cards with intent and scope definitions
  - Trusted independent adjudication panel to resolve disputes 
  - Automatic verification to confirm issue reproducibility
- CFD introduces triage, review, and adjudication processes to balance interests of vendors and community when recognizing issues.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of limitations of current AI harm reporting approaches compared to mature CVD conventions in software security
- Examination of distinct disclosure challenges posed by properties unique to ML models
- Proposal of a structured CFD framework customized for ML/AI systems to enhance transparency and trust 
- Governance recommendations, including model card standardization, to enable practical implementation of CFD
- Identification of open problems like tracking complex ML model histories and establishing weakness taxonomies

In summary, the paper makes the case for a tailored Coordinated Flaw Disclosure process designed specifically for the nuances of modern AI systems in order to promote accountability and effective issue remediation.
