# [Coordinated Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current AI harm reporting operates on an ad hoc basis, lacking structured processes for disclosing or addressing algorithmic flaws. In contrast, software security relies on robust Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) processes.
- Machine learning (ML) models have unique properties compared to traditional software, warranting a specialized disclosure framework. ML issues involve statistical validity thresholds and often extend beyond security to encompass trustworthiness and bias.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a tailored "Coordinated Flaw Disclosure" (CFD) framework for ML/AI systems to formalize the recognition of valid model issues.
- Core components of CFD include:
  - Extended model cards with intent and scope definitions
  - Trusted independent adjudication panel to resolve disputes 
  - Automatic verification to confirm issue reproducibility
- CFD introduces triage, review, and adjudication processes to balance interests of vendors and community when recognizing issues.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of limitations of current AI harm reporting approaches compared to mature CVD conventions in software security
- Examination of distinct disclosure challenges posed by properties unique to ML models
- Proposal of a structured CFD framework customized for ML/AI systems to enhance transparency and trust 
- Governance recommendations, including model card standardization, to enable practical implementation of CFD
- Identification of open problems like tracking complex ML model histories and establishing weakness taxonomies

In summary, the paper makes the case for a tailored Coordinated Flaw Disclosure process designed specifically for the nuances of modern AI systems in order to promote accountability and effective issue remediation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes adapting the established software vulnerability disclosure process into a tailored "Coordinated Flaw Disclosure" framework for machine learning systems to address their unique challenges through transparent model cards, independent issue adjudication, and streamlined reporting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a tailored "Coordinated Flaw Disclosure" (CFD) framework for disclosing issues with machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. 

Key aspects of the proposed CFD framework include:

- Extending model cards to provide more detailed documentation on the intent and scope of ML models and systems. This will help define what types of issues are in scope to be reported.

- Establishing an independent adjudication panel to help resolve disputes between issue submitters and vendors when determining if a reported issue is valid. 

- Incorporating automatic verification of reported issues via submitted input/output pairs. This streamlines the reporting process.

- Defining an issue reporting governance process involving triage, review, and potential adjudication of submissions.

The goal of the CFD framework is to balance the interests of vendors and the broader community in order to enhance transparency and public trust around AI systems. It aims to provide a structured process tailored to the unique properties of machine learning systems and the types of flaws they exhibit.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes adapting the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) framework into a Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored for machine learning systems. What are some key differences between traditional software vulnerabilities and issues with machine learning models that warrant this specialized approach?

2. The paper argues that the CFD framework should incorporate an extension of model cards to provide detailed documentation of intent and scope. What specific information should these extended model cards include to make intent and scope definitions actionable? What challenges need to be addressed to enable standardized model cards across organizations?

3. The CFD framework proposes incorporating an independent adjudication panel to mediate disputes between flaw submitters and vendors. What should the structure and composition of this panel look like to ensure fair and informed evaluations? What precedents from existing vulnerability disclosure programs could it build upon?  

4. The paper advocates for an automated verification mechanism through submission extensions to enhance the efficiency of the recognition process. What specific technical capabilities need to be built into the CFD framework to enable automatic reproduction of reported issues and integration into vendors' internal testing datasets?

5. What adjustments need to be made to the traditional concept of an in-scope vulnerability to account for the statistical nature of flaws in machine learning models? How can the CFD submission review process distinguish valid violations from issues stemming from sampling biases?  

6. The paper acknowledges challenges in adapting the Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE) system to machine learning due to heavy context-dependence. What best practices can be borrowed from the software domain while accounting for the unique documentation dependencies of machine learning models?

7. What policy implications need to be considered regarding legal protections for good faith flaw discovery and disclosure by independent ML researchers? How can the CFD framework balance organizational interests with community participation rights?

8. What limitations of the proposed CFD framework could arise due to lack of adoption of standardized model cards? What parallel lessons can be learned from the evolution of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)?  

9. How should the CFD flaw taxonomy differentiate between security vulnerabilities, model design failures, error reports and ethical issues - each warranting specialized handling? What harms typically fall through the cracks in current ad hoc reporting mechanisms?

10. What mechanisms need to be built into CFD processes to incentivize and reward researcher participation through recognition and remuneration? Are bias bounty programs sufficient or are additional participatory approaches required?
