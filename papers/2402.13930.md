# [Enhancing Reinforcement Learning Agents with Local Guides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn good policies. This is problematic for real-world applications where interactions are expensive or unsafe. The paper proposes using local guide policies from external sources to enhance RL agents.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formalizes a framework called Reinforcement Learning with Local Guides (RLLG) where an RL agent has access to:

1) A local guide policy πg that is only relevant in a small region of the state space Sg. This could come from human experts, physics-based controllers, etc. 

2) A confidence function λ indicating how relevant πg is in each state.

The paper adapts standard RL algorithms like Soft Actor Critic (SAC) to leverage these local guides in two ways:

1) Exploration - πg leads the agent to meaningful states to improve sample efficiency. 

2) Safety - Conservative πg prevents visiting catastrophic states.

Three adapted algorithms are analyzed:

1) Strict Action Guided (SAG): Switches between πg and the RL policy based on λ.

2) Reward Guided (RG): Shapes rewards to account for πg. 

3) Policy Improvement Guided (PIG): Regularizes RL update to stay close to πg.

The paper then introduces a novel Perturbed Action Guided (PAG) method where the RL policy explores by adding noise to πg's actions. PAG overcomes limitations of the other approaches.

Main Contributions:

1) Formalization of using local guides to enhance RL agents

2) Adaptation of RL algorithms like SAC to leverage these guides

3) Introduction of a novel Perturbed Action Guided (PAG) algorithm that explores by perturbing the guide's actions

4) Demonstration that PAG improves sample efficiency and safety over standard RL and other adapted algorithms on a suite of MuJoCo environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to enhance reinforcement learning agents with local guide policies in order to improve sample efficiency and prevent the agent from entering unsafe states.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called Perturbed Action Guided (PAG) to enhance Approximate Policy Iteration-based reinforcement learning agents with local guide policies. Specifically, PAG introduces a parameterized perturbation to gradually improve upon and overcome the limitations of local guide policies, while still benefiting from good policy initialization. The method is evaluated in two use cases - using local guides to efficiently explore and to maintain safety without violations. Experiments across several environments demonstrate that PAG is more stable, robust, and efficient compared to prior approaches for integrating local controllers. A key advantage highlighted is the ability to strictly constrain closeness to the local guide when safety is critical.

The paper introduces a new framework called "Reinforcement Learning with Local Guides" aimed at improving sample efficiency and safety of RL agents by integrating external knowledge in the form of local guide policies. The core ideas focus on using these local guides to initialize policies, guide exploration, and prevent unsafe actions. Both attractive and repulsive local guide policies are studied across a range of MuJoCo and Bullet-Safety-Gym environments. The proposed PAG algorithm based on approximate policy iteration is shown to outperform prior methods in leveraging such local guides.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new framework called "Reinforcement Learning with Local Guides (RLLG)". How is this framework different from traditional reinforcement learning and what problem does it aim to solve?

2. The paper defines local guides as controllers that are only relevant in a small region of the state space. What are some real-world examples where we may have access to such local guides? 

3. The paper adapts existing approximate policy iteration (API) algorithms like SAC to the RLLG setting. What changes need to be made to the policy evaluation and policy improvement steps to incorporate the local guides?

4. The paper proposes a new algorithm called Perturbed Action Guided (PAG). How does PAG leverage the local guides compared to other methods like Strict Action Guided (SAG) and Policy Improvement Guided (PIG)? What is the key idea behind PAG?

5. Analyze the parameterized perturbation function ξφ in the PAG algorithm. What role does it play? How is it trained to improve over the local guides? Discuss the associated hyperparameter Φ.

6. Why is handling the distribution shift important when evaluating the switched policy in SAG? Explain the difference between naive SAG and the proposed SAG algorithm.  

7. The paper demonstrates the sensitivity of PIG to the choice of the Lagrange multiplier schedule {βk}. Why is this a problem in real-world applications? How does PAG overcome this limitation?

8. What are the two key use cases studied for evaluating guided agents - attractive policies and repulsive policies? Give an example environment for each case and discuss how the local guides are designed.

9. The paper uses normalized area under the learning curve to evaluate and compare different guided agents. What does this metric capture? Why is it more informative than just comparing final cumulative rewards?

10. The paper makes an assumption regarding access to the guide confidence function λ(s). Discuss the limitations of this assumption and how the method can be extended for complex environments where λ(s) is not precisely known.
