# [Let's Think Frame by Frame: Evaluating Video Chain of Thought with Video   Infilling and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13903)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop video chain of thought reasoning to enhance video understanding using language models while remaining computationally efficient?

The key points are:

- Videos constitute a large portion of internet traffic, but have been under-explored in AI compared to images and text. Recent advances in multimodal language models present an opportunity to improve video understanding.

- Processing every frame of a long video is computationally expensive. The authors propose video chain of thought - using keyframes and textual scene descriptions to allow language models to reason about videos efficiently. 

- The authors introduce the VIP dataset with real videos, keyframes, scene descriptions, and two new tasks (video infilling and prediction) to benchmark video chain of thought models.

- They provide a pipeline to extract keyframes and generate structured and unstructured textual scene descriptions of the keyframes.

- Benchmarking on VIP shows current models struggle with the complex video reasoning required, demonstrating the need for further research into video chain of thought.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that video chain of thought with keyframes and scene descriptions can enable language models to efficiently perform complex video understanding and reasoning. The VIP dataset is introduced to evaluate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new research direction called "Video Chain of Thought" (VideoCOT) to improve video understanding and reasoning by leveraging the capabilities of large language models. Specifically:

- They introduce a pipeline to extract keyframes from videos and generate detailed scene descriptions (both unstructured and structured in a FAMOuS format) for each keyframe. 

- They propose the Video Infilling and Prediction (VIP) dataset containing real-life videos, keyframes, and corresponding scene descriptions to evaluate video reasoning abilities. VIP has two new tasks: video infilling (generating in-between frames) and video prediction.

- They provide qualitative examples demonstrating how their generated scene descriptions can help current multimodal models like Otter perform better on the VIP tasks compared to just using the keyframes. 

- They argue that video understanding would benefit from transforming videos into textual scene descriptions that allow leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models through chain of thought prompting. Their VIP dataset and tasks are intended as a benchmark to promote research into this video chain of thought approach.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing VideoCOT, the VIP dataset, and associated video reasoning tasks as a way to advance video understanding by utilizing the strengths of large language models operating on descriptive scene text rather than just the raw video frames.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Video Infilling and Prediction (VIP) dataset for evaluating video chain of thought reasoning abilities of vision-language models on keyframes extracted from real-life videos using a pipeline that also generates structured and unstructured textual scene descriptions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on video understanding and reasoning:

- It focuses on reasoning across multiple video frames, whereas much prior work has focused on single-frame understanding or used additional textual context like subtitles. This is a relatively new direction that aims to better capture temporal relationships and dynamics.

- It proposes a pipeline to extract keyframes and generate structured scene descriptions, providing a useful framework for transforming videos into a format more amenable to language model reasoning. Other related work has not focused as much on generating descriptive text from videos.

- It introduces two new benchmark tasks, video infilling and prediction, that require multiframe understanding and generation. These are novel tasks compared to prior video QA datasets. 

- It uses real-world videos rather than constrained domains like games and simulations that some other recent video reasoning datasets use. This makes the tasks more challenging and generalizable.

- It aims to apply vision-language models like Otter to the video domain, assessing their capabilities on complex reasoning versus other models like temporal convolutional networks. Their goal is to combine strengths of LLMs and VL models.

- The dataset is designed for inference-time evaluation rather than requiring training on video-text pairs. This makes it easy to benchmark different models.

Overall, this paper pushes towards more complex, general video understanding focused on temporal reasoning across multiple frames. The proposed dataset and tasks aim to encourage further research on how to effectively apply large language models and their reasoning abilities to advance video analysis. The keyframe pipeline and generation of descriptive text also seem like useful contributions to this emerging research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving video chain of thought reasoning through different models and strategies for effective in-context learning. The authors found that existing models still struggle with complex video reasoning tasks like video infilling and prediction. They suggest using the VIP dataset to develop better techniques for video chain of thought.

- Incorporating more advanced vision-language models into the video reasoning pipeline. The authors benchmarked models like Otter but believe there is room for improvement by leveraging more recent multimodal models.

- Expanding the video reasoning tasks and dataset beyond keyframes. The authors focus on keyframes for efficiency but suggest expanding to include more complete video understanding in future work.

- Generating video frames conditioned on scene descriptions. The authors show scene descriptions can improve reasoning, suggesting leveraging them to actually generate missing video frames.

- Applying video chain of thought to additional downstream tasks. The authors propose video infilling and prediction as useful for other video applications needing reasoning.

- Developing video understanding models that are more efficient and generalizable. The authors aim to promote models that have strong reasoning abilities but are also practical for real-world usage.

In summary, the key directions are improving video chain of thought techniques, incorporating more advanced models, expanding the scope of tasks and datasets, using scene descriptions for conditional video generation, applying the approach to downstream tasks, and improving efficiency and generalization. The authors present VIP as a starting point to drive future research in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset called VIP (Video Infilling and Prediction) to evaluate the ability of vision-language models to perform video reasoning through a technique called VideoCOT (Video Chain of Thought). Despite the prevalence of video content, there has been little research applying powerful language models to video analysis and reasoning. The paper introduces a pipeline to extract keyframes from videos and generate structured and unstructured textual scene descriptions for each keyframe. The VIP dataset contains real-life videos, keyframes, and scene descriptions, and defines two novel video reasoning tasks on the keyframes: video infilling (generating missing in-between frames) and video prediction (anticipating subsequent keyframes). Benchmarking experiments on VIP with existing models like Otter demonstrate these tasks are challenging but structured scene descriptions can enhance reasoning. Overall, the paper aims to promote complex video understanding and generation with resource-efficient video chain of thought using vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Video Chain of Thought (VideoCOT), a new research direction that applies the reasoning abilities of large language models to video understanding and generation. The key idea is to represent a video by its keyframes and textual scene descriptions, rather than directly processing the full video. This reduces computational complexity while still capturing the core content. 

The authors introduce the Video Infilling and Prediction (VIP) dataset to evaluate VideoCOT models. VIP contains real-life videos, extracted keyframes, and structured and unstructured textual scene descriptions for each keyframe. It also defines two novel tasks: video infilling (generating missing in-between keyframes) and video prediction (anticipating subsequent keyframes). Initial experiments with the VIP dataset and an existing multimodal model (Otter) demonstrate the potential of textual scene descriptions to enhance keyframe reasoning and generation. However, there is still substantial room for improving video chain of thought capabilities. The authors encourage using VIP as an inference benchmark to promote further research on video-text reasoning.

In summary, the paper proposes VideoCOT to bring language model reasoning to video understanding, introduces the VIP dataset to evaluate this capability, and provides initial benchmarking that demonstrates promise as well as areas needing improvement. The overall goal is to develop models that can reason about videos efficiently while capturing semantic content.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a pipeline to generate descriptive scene descriptions for keyframes extracted from real-life videos. First, they use models like Katna, CLIP, Detic and GRiT to extract and prune important keyframes from the videos. Then, they extract visual information from these keyframes using object detection models like Detic and dense captioning models like GRiT. They also generate image captions using BLIP. Next, they feed all this information into a language model like GPT-4 to generate an unstructured, descriptive scene description for each keyframe. To create a structured description, they further prompt GPT-4 to extract specific elements like the focus, action, mood, objects and setting (FAMOuS) from the dense description. The structured and unstructured descriptions provide detailed context about the keyframes. Finally, they propose two tasks on their new VIP dataset - video infilling, which involves generating missing in-between keyframes, and video prediction, which involves anticipating subsequent keyframes. These tasks demonstrate the ability of models to reason about multiple frames using the generated scene descriptions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the lack of research and datasets for evaluating complex video reasoning abilities of AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Some key points:

- Video content makes up a large portion of internet traffic, but has been underrepresented in generative AI research compared to images and text. 

- Recent LLMs have shown impressive reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities, especially when combined with visual information in vision-language models. However, these abilities have not been extensively applied to videos.

- Most existing video datasets focus on video summarization, single-frame understanding, or rely heavily on pre-existing textual information about videos. There is a lack of datasets that require understanding relationships between multiple frames in general real-life videos.

- Processing every frame of a video is computationally expensive and may not help with high-level reasoning. The authors propose "video chain of thought" - using keyframes and generated scene descriptions to allow LLMs to reason about videos efficiently.

- The paper introduces the VIP dataset containing videos, keyframes, and structured/unstructured textual scene descriptions to evaluate video chain of thought through new tasks like video infilling and prediction.

In summary, the paper aims to address the gap between progress in LLMs/vision-language models and their application to complex video understanding, proposing video chain of thought and the VIP benchmark to evaluate this direction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Here are some key terms and concepts I noticed in this paper:

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the Video Infilling and Prediction Dataset (VIP) to evaluate models' capabilities for multi-frame video reasoning. The authors propose representing videos by extracting keyframes and generating two textual representations - unstructured dense captions and structured "FAMOuS" (Focus, Action, Mood, Objects, Setting) scene descriptions. They introduce two tasks on this dataset - Video Infilling, where models must predict intermediate masked keyframes given surrounding context, and Video Prediction, where models must predict future keyframes given preceding ones. While benchmarking models like GPT-3, GPT-4 and Vicuna on VIP, the authors find significant room for improvement in complex video reasoning abilities. The paper motivates developing models that can efficiently reason about videos by processing sparse keyframes instead of full videos. It also highlights the need for multimodal models that can take in both visual frames and text, unlike the language-only models tested. Overall, this work opens exciting avenues for video understanding by formulating it as a chain of textual scene reasoning.
