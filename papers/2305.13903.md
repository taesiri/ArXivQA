# Let's Think Frame by Frame: Evaluating Video Chain of Thought with Video   Infilling and Prediction

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop video chain of thought reasoning to enhance video understanding using language models while remaining computationally efficient?The key points are:- Videos constitute a large portion of internet traffic, but have been under-explored in AI compared to images and text. Recent advances in multimodal language models present an opportunity to improve video understanding.- Processing every frame of a long video is computationally expensive. The authors propose video chain of thought - using keyframes and textual scene descriptions to allow language models to reason about videos efficiently. - The authors introduce the VIP dataset with real videos, keyframes, scene descriptions, and two new tasks (video infilling and prediction) to benchmark video chain of thought models.- They provide a pipeline to extract keyframes and generate structured and unstructured textual scene descriptions of the keyframes.- Benchmarking on VIP shows current models struggle with the complex video reasoning required, demonstrating the need for further research into video chain of thought.In summary, the key hypothesis is that video chain of thought with keyframes and scene descriptions can enable language models to efficiently perform complex video understanding and reasoning. The VIP dataset is introduced to evaluate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new research direction called "Video Chain of Thought" (VideoCOT) to improve video understanding and reasoning by leveraging the capabilities of large language models. Specifically:- They introduce a pipeline to extract keyframes from videos and generate detailed scene descriptions (both unstructured and structured in a FAMOuS format) for each keyframe. - They propose the Video Infilling and Prediction (VIP) dataset containing real-life videos, keyframes, and corresponding scene descriptions to evaluate video reasoning abilities. VIP has two new tasks: video infilling (generating in-between frames) and video prediction.- They provide qualitative examples demonstrating how their generated scene descriptions can help current multimodal models like Otter perform better on the VIP tasks compared to just using the keyframes. - They argue that video understanding would benefit from transforming videos into textual scene descriptions that allow leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models through chain of thought prompting. Their VIP dataset and tasks are intended as a benchmark to promote research into this video chain of thought approach.In summary, the key contribution is proposing VideoCOT, the VIP dataset, and associated video reasoning tasks as a way to advance video understanding by utilizing the strengths of large language models operating on descriptive scene text rather than just the raw video frames.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces the Video Infilling and Prediction (VIP) dataset for evaluating video chain of thought reasoning abilities of vision-language models on keyframes extracted from real-life videos using a pipeline that also generates structured and unstructured textual scene descriptions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on video understanding and reasoning:- It focuses on reasoning across multiple video frames, whereas much prior work has focused on single-frame understanding or used additional textual context like subtitles. This is a relatively new direction that aims to better capture temporal relationships and dynamics.- It proposes a pipeline to extract keyframes and generate structured scene descriptions, providing a useful framework for transforming videos into a format more amenable to language model reasoning. Other related work has not focused as much on generating descriptive text from videos.- It introduces two new benchmark tasks, video infilling and prediction, that require multiframe understanding and generation. These are novel tasks compared to prior video QA datasets. - It uses real-world videos rather than constrained domains like games and simulations that some other recent video reasoning datasets use. This makes the tasks more challenging and generalizable.- It aims to apply vision-language models like Otter to the video domain, assessing their capabilities on complex reasoning versus other models like temporal convolutional networks. Their goal is to combine strengths of LLMs and VL models.- The dataset is designed for inference-time evaluation rather than requiring training on video-text pairs. This makes it easy to benchmark different models.Overall, this paper pushes towards more complex, general video understanding focused on temporal reasoning across multiple frames. The proposed dataset and tasks aim to encourage further research on how to effectively apply large language models and their reasoning abilities to advance video analysis. The keyframe pipeline and generation of descriptive text also seem like useful contributions to this emerging research area.
