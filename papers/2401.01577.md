# [Test-Time Personalization with Meta Prompt for Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Test-Time Personalization with Meta Prompt for Gaze Estimation":

Problem: 
Existing gaze estimation methods rely on supervised learning on labeled datasets and suffer from performance degradation when tested on real-world data with distribution shift. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been proposed, they assume availability of source domain data or a large amount of target domain data. This paper studies a more practical problem - test-time personalization of gaze estimation without any labels or source data. The challenges are to achieve efficient and accurate personalization on limited personalized data.

Proposed Solution:
1) Prompt Tuning: Inspired by advances in NLP, the authors propose tuning a small group of parameters called "prompt" instead of the whole network. The prompt contains <1% parameters of a ResNet-18, enabling efficient adaptation.

2) Meta Prompt: It is unclear if minimizing an unsupervised loss would minimize gaze error. Thus, the authors propose meta-learning to initialize the prompt so that its updates towards lower unsupervised loss (here symmetry loss) also reduce gaze error.  

Main Contributions:
1) First work to study test-time personalized gaze estimation without labels or source data.

2) Proposes prompt tuning for efficient adaptation with <1% trainable parameters. 

3) Employs meta-learning to align unsupervised loss and gaze error for effective adaptation.

4) Experiments show the method adapts >10x faster than compared UDA methods and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art across 4 cross-dataset tasks.

In summary, this paper makes both algorithmic and practical contributions for enabling accurate and efficient test-time personalization of gaze estimation models without additional supervision.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient test-time personalization method for gaze estimation by meta-learning a trainable prompt that can rapidly adapt to individual characteristics using only a few unlabeled images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing an efficient method for test-time personalized gaze estimation that achieves fast adaptation by leveraging prompt tuning. The prompt is person-specific and memory-saving, with a cost of less than 1% of a ResNet-18 model.

2) Employing meta-learning to initialize the prompt, explicitly ensuring that test-time prompt updates result in reduced gaze estimation error. 

3) Conducting extensive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach significantly outperforms existing methods and adapts at least 10 times faster than compared methods.
