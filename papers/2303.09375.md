# [DINAR: Diffusion Inpainting of Neural Textures for One-Shot Human   Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to create realistic full-body human avatars from a single RGB image that can be easily animated. The key hypothesis is that using neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model can achieve photo-realistic quality while enabling easy animation and fast inference of the avatars.The paper proposes a method called DINAR that generates animatable avatars from single images using neural textures and a parametric body model. The key aspects are:- Using a combination of RGB and latent neural textures to represent the avatar appearance. The RGB part captures high-frequency details while the neural part models aspects like hair and clothing. - Employing a diffusion model to realistically reconstruct unseen parts like the person's back given only a frontal view as input. - Leveraging the SMPL-X model to enable easy animation of the resulting avatar in new poses.The main hypothesis is that this approach can create animatable avatars from single images that exhibit state-of-the-art realism and generalization ability to new poses and views, as validated through experiments.
