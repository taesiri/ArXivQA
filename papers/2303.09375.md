# [DINAR: Diffusion Inpainting of Neural Textures for One-Shot Human   Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to create realistic full-body human avatars from a single RGB image that can be easily animated. The key hypothesis is that using neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model can achieve photo-realistic quality while enabling easy animation and fast inference of the avatars.

The paper proposes a method called DINAR that generates animatable avatars from single images using neural textures and a parametric body model. The key aspects are:

- Using a combination of RGB and latent neural textures to represent the avatar appearance. The RGB part captures high-frequency details while the neural part models aspects like hair and clothing. 

- Employing a diffusion model to realistically reconstruct unseen parts like the person's back given only a frontal view as input. 

- Leveraging the SMPL-X model to enable easy animation of the resulting avatar in new poses.

The main hypothesis is that this approach can create animatable avatars from single images that exhibit state-of-the-art realism and generalization ability to new poses and views, as validated through experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting DINAR, a method for creating realistic rigged fullbody avatars from single RGB images. The key aspects are:

- Using neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model to achieve photo-realistic quality while keeping avatars easy to animate and fast to infer. 

- A new architecture for generating neural textures, combining an RGB part explicitly extracted from the input image and additional neural channels obtained by encoding the image into a latent space.

- Adapting diffusion models to inpaint missing regions of the neural texture such as the person's back given only a frontal view as input. This allows generating complete avatars from partial views.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art results on the SnapshotPeople benchmark and qualitative results showing the method can handle a variety of clothing, poses, and viewpoints from just a single photo.

In summary, the main contribution is a full pipeline for generating high quality animatable avatars from single images by leveraging neural textures and diffusion-based inpainting. The combination of these techniques allows photorealistic rendering of even unseen parts of the person.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called DINAR for creating realistic animated full-body avatars from single images using neural textures and a diffusion model for inpainting missing texture regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on generating full-body avatars from single images:

- The use of neural textures built on top of the SMPL-X parametric body model is similar to other recent works like StylePeople and ANR. This allows generating animatable avatars while retaining photo-realism. However, this paper focuses on improving the quality and fidelity of the reconstructed textures.

- The main novelty is the use of a diffusion model for inpainting the neural textures. Previous works relied on GANs for inpainting which can suffer from mode collapse. Diffusion models help generate more diverse and realistic results by modeling the complex distribution more accurately.

- For training the diffusion model, the authors use multi-view renders of 3D scans as ground truth data. This is different from some other works that use video sequences or image collections. The multi-view scans likely provide more complete texture data for supervision.

- Quantitative evaluations on the SnapshotPeople benchmark show this method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of metrics like KID, identity preservation, and similarity to ground truth. Qualitative results also look more realistic than most other methods.

- The approach seems to generalize well to new poses and viewpoints, even for things like loose skirts or hands near the body. The animations in Figure 1 demonstrate this capability.

Overall, the combination of neural textures, SMPL-X model, and diffusion-based inpainting appears to be an effective approach for one-shot avatar generation. The use of diffusion models to improve texture quality is a noteworthy novelty compared to related works. Both quantitative and qualitative results seem state-of-the-art based on the experiments and comparisons presented.
