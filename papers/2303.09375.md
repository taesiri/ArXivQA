# [DINAR: Diffusion Inpainting of Neural Textures for One-Shot Human   Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to create realistic full-body human avatars from a single RGB image that can be easily animated. The key hypothesis is that using neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model can achieve photo-realistic quality while enabling easy animation and fast inference of the avatars.

The paper proposes a method called DINAR that generates animatable avatars from single images using neural textures and a parametric body model. The key aspects are:

- Using a combination of RGB and latent neural textures to represent the avatar appearance. The RGB part captures high-frequency details while the neural part models aspects like hair and clothing. 

- Employing a diffusion model to realistically reconstruct unseen parts like the person's back given only a frontal view as input. 

- Leveraging the SMPL-X model to enable easy animation of the resulting avatar in new poses.

The main hypothesis is that this approach can create animatable avatars from single images that exhibit state-of-the-art realism and generalization ability to new poses and views, as validated through experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting DINAR, a method for creating realistic rigged fullbody avatars from single RGB images. The key aspects are:

- Using neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model to achieve photo-realistic quality while keeping avatars easy to animate and fast to infer. 

- A new architecture for generating neural textures, combining an RGB part explicitly extracted from the input image and additional neural channels obtained by encoding the image into a latent space.

- Adapting diffusion models to inpaint missing regions of the neural texture such as the person's back given only a frontal view as input. This allows generating complete avatars from partial views.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art results on the SnapshotPeople benchmark and qualitative results showing the method can handle a variety of clothing, poses, and viewpoints from just a single photo.

In summary, the main contribution is a full pipeline for generating high quality animatable avatars from single images by leveraging neural textures and diffusion-based inpainting. The combination of these techniques allows photorealistic rendering of even unseen parts of the person.
