# [Understanding the Effects of RLHF on LLM Generalisation and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06452)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution appears to be an extensive analysis of how each stage of the RLHF process (supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning) affects two key properties of large language models: out-of-distribution generalisation and output diversity. The key findings seem to be:

- RLHF improves in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution generalisation compared to supervised fine-tuning. 

- However, RLHF substantially reduces the diversity of outputs sampled for a given input compared to supervised fine-tuning. Even across inputs, RLHF produces less diverse text on some metrics.

- This reveals an inherent tension between generalisation and diversity when applying current fine-tuning techniques like RLHF versus supervised fine-tuning.

- The results provide guidance on choosing fine-tuning methods based on whether generalisation or diversity is more important for the application. 

- More research is needed to improve the trade-off between generalisation and diversity in language model fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be a rigorous analysis evaluating supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and RLHF on generalisation and diversity, revealing a tradeoff between these properties using current techniques. The results provide new insights into the effects of different fine-tuning methods on large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper focuses on analyzing the effects of different stages in the RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) pipeline on model generalization and output diversity. Other recent work has developed new methods for LLM fine-tuning (e.g. CoOp CARP, RRHF, HIR) but hasn't rigorously analyzed the properties of existing methods like RLHF in this way. 

- The analysis of generalization is quite unique - most prior work evaluates LLMs on the same distribution as training data. This paper systematically constructs train/test splits with distribution shifts and measures performance, allowing them to study generalization directly. Their finding that RLHF generalizes better, especially for harder distribution shifts, is novel.

- While a few prior works have observed that RLHF reduces output diversity, this paper provides the most comprehensive analysis of this effect using multiple diversity metrics that are externally validated. Measuring both per-input and across-input diversity is also novel.

- The findings demonstrate an inherent tradeoff between generalization and diversity from current LLM fine-tuning methods. While this tradeoff was speculated about before, this paper provides clear empirical evidence for the first time.

- Using two base models and two tasks makes the results more robust than most prior work which focuses on a single setup. The tasks chosen (summarization and instruction following) are also highly relevant for current real-world LLM applications.

Overall, this paper provides critical new insights into the effects of different LLM fine-tuning techniques through its unique focus on generalization and diversity. The analysis is more comprehensive, systematic, and rigorous than prior work. The findings reveal important limitations of current methods that can motivate new research directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Investigating why RLHF reduces output diversity so much, and whether this diversity can be recovered without losing performance gains. The authors propose taking inspiration from RL literature on injecting diversity into the optimization process.

- Empirically validating hypotheses about why RLHF generalizes better than SFT. The authors mention some existing hypotheses like RLHF finding better in-distribution policies or SFT overfitting, but these need to be experimentally tested. 

- Evaluating the effects of other LLM fine-tuning methods beyond SFT, RLHF and BoN on generalisation and diversity. The authors mention several other promising methods that could be analyzed.

- Performing human evaluations of the effects of different fine-tuning methods on factors like generalisation and diversity. The authors mainly use automated metrics as proxies for human judgement.

- Analyzing generalisation and diversity for more combinations of base models, tasks, and datasets. The authors demonstrate results on two base models over two tasks, but further verification is needed.

- Developing novel techniques to improve both generalisation and diversity without sacrificing either. The authors suggest the tradeoff they find may not be fundamental.

- Further theoretical analysis into whether the generalisation/diversity tradeoff stems from fundamental limitations or deficits in current LLM fine-tuning techniques.

In summary, the authors lay out a research agenda for better understanding the effects of different LLM fine-tuning techniques on important properties like generalisation and diversity, and suggest developing new techniques that can improve on current methods.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How does each stage of the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipeline for fine-tuning large language models affect model performance in terms of out-of-distribution generalization and output diversity? 

The key stages of the RLHF pipeline that are examined are:

- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) 
- Reward modeling
- Reinforcement learning (RL)

The paper compares these stages to each other and to a baseline of best-of-N (BoN) sampling in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance on two tasks - summarization and instruction following. It also analyzes the output diversity of the models after each stage of training.

The main hypothesis seems to be that the RL stage of RLHF leads to better generalizing models, but at the cost of reduced output diversity compared to SFT. Analyzing this tradeoff between generalizability and diversity for the different training methods is a key focus.

In summary, the central research question is understanding the effects of the different components of RLHF training on model generalization and diversity in order to provide guidance on which methods are most suitable for different applications. The key hypothesis is that RLHF improves generalization but reduces diversity compared to SFT.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes three methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) - supervised fine-tuning (SFT), best-of-N (BoN) sampling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - in terms of their effects on out-of-distribution generalisation and output diversity. Experiments are conducted on summarization and instruction following tasks using the LLaMa and OPT models. The results show that RLHF improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance compared to SFT, but substantially reduces output diversity. Even when sampling outputs for different inputs, RLHF is less diverse than SFT on some metrics, demonstrating "mode collapse". The findings reveal a tradeoff between generalisation and diversity when fine-tuning LLMs, implying current methods do not achieve the optimal balance. The paper underscores the need for new techniques that improve both attributes and research to understand if this tradeoff is inherent or a deficiency of current techniques. Overall, it provides guidance on choosing fine-tuning methods based on whether generalisation or diversity is more important for a given application.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the effects of different fine-tuning methods - supervised fine-tuning (SFT), best-of-N sampling (BoN), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - on two key properties of large language models: out-of-distribution generalisation and output diversity. The authors evaluate models fine-tuned with these methods on summarization and instruction following tasks. For generalisation, they test performance on in-distribution and systematically out-of-distribution test sets. For diversity, they measure syntactic, semantic, and logical diversity metrics on outputs. 

The key findings are: 1) RLHF improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance compared to SFT, but the generalisation gap is similar. 2) However, RLHF substantially reduces output diversity compared to SFT, especially per-input diversity - implying a trade-off between generalisation and diversity in current LLM fine-tuning approaches. The results suggest RLHF is better when distribution shifts are larger, but has potential downsides for creative applications requiring diversity. Further research is needed to improve this trade-off and understand whether it is fundamental.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents an extensive analysis of how each stage of the RLHF process (supervised fine-tuning, reward modelling, and reinforcement learning) affects two key properties of large language models: out-of-distribution generalisation and output diversity. To evaluate generalisation, the authors fine-tune LLMs using RLHF and supervised learning on summarisation and instruction following tasks, and test on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. GPT-4 is used as a simulated human evaluator to measure performance. To evaluate diversity, they sample outputs from the models and calculate syntactic, semantic, and logical diversity metrics. Across two base models and tasks, they find that RLHF improves generalisation, especially on more difficult distribution shifts, but substantially reduces output diversity compared to supervised fine-tuning. This demonstrates an inherent tradeoff between generalisation and diversity when fine-tuning large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper appears to be investigating the effects of different stages in the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) fine-tuning pipeline on two key properties of large language models (LLMs): out-of-distribution generalisation and output diversity. 

Specifically, the paper examines supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling, and RLHF, as well as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, evaluating how each affects in-distribution performance, out-of-distribution performance, and output diversity.

The main problems/questions being addressed seem to be:

- How does each stage of RLHF fine-tuning affect out-of-distribution generalisation of LLMs? This is important for ensuring models can reliably perform well across diverse real-world scenarios beyond their training distribution.

- How does each stage affect the diversity of LLM outputs? Output diversity is crucial for many applications like story generation or creative tasks where varied responses are needed.

- Is there a trade-off between generalisation and diversity when choosing different fine-tuning methods? 

- Can analysis of different stages provide guidance on which techniques to use for different applications?

Overall, the paper seems aimed at elucidating the effects of different parts of the RLHF pipeline on these two key properties of generalisation and diversity, to better understand the strengths/weaknesses of current LLM fine-tuning approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): A technique for fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning and human preferences. This involves supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling to learn a reward function from human preferences, and RL optimization using the learned reward.

- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT): Fine-tuning a pretrained language model on demonstrations using standard supervised learning techniques like cross-entropy loss. This is a common baseline approach.

- Reward modeling (RM): Learning a reward function from human preferences between pairs of model outputs. The reward function acts as a proxy for human judgement.

- Proximal policy optimization (PPO): A policy gradient RL algorithm commonly used for RLHF. It optimizes a surrogate objective with a clipped probability ratio.

- Best-of-N (BoN): Using a learned reward model to select the best output out of N sampled outputs at test time. Also known as rejection sampling.

- Generalization: Evaluating model performance on out-of-distribution inputs compared to the training distribution. Important for deploying models.

- Diversity: The variety and dissimilarity of model outputs. Captured by metrics like distinct n-grams, sentence embeddings, and NLI.

- Mode collapse: Tendency of RLHF models to output text of a specific style regardless of the input. Reduces diversity.

The key findings are that RLHF improves generalization but harms diversity compared to SFT. This reveals a tradeoff between these properties when fine-tuning LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). How does using RLHF for fine-tuning compare to other methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in terms of sample efficiency and final performance? Does RLHF require more or less data than SFT to achieve good performance?

2. The authors evaluate the effects of each stage of RLHF (supervised pretraining, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning) on out-of-distribution generalization and output diversity. What are the key findings in terms of how each stage affects these properties? Does any one stage seem particularly important for improving generalization or maintaining diversity?

3. The paper finds that RLHF improves out-of-distribution generalization compared to SFT, but at the cost of reduced output diversity. Why might this trade-off occur? Is it an inherent limitation of RLHF or something that could potentially be addressed by modifications to the method?

4. For the instruction following experiments, the authors use models from the AlpacaFarm framework. How are those models trained and how does it compare to the training process for the summarization models? What implications might the differences have for interpreting the instruction following results?

5. The authors use GPT-4 through the OpenAI API to evaluate model performance as a proxy for human evaluation. What are the potential limitations of using an automated metric like this rather than real human assessments? How well does GPT-4 correlate with human judgement based on the validation experiments?

6. Several diversity metrics are used including distinct n-grams, sentence BERT embeddings, and NLI. Why is it useful to evaluate diversity in multiple ways? Do the different metrics tend to agree on which models are more diverse? Are there other diversity metrics that could provide additional insights?

7. For the summarization experiments, what is the nature of the distribution shift between the in-distribution (TL;DR) and out-of-distribution (CNN/DailyMail) test sets? Why does this particular shift serve as a good evaluation of generalization capabilities?

8. How were the different training splits (length, sentiment, subreddit) constructed for the OPT experiments in the appendix? What motivated using these particular splits to induce distribution shifts between training and testing?

9. The appendix includes experiments sweeping over different values of N for best-of-N sampling. How does increasing N affect in-distribution performance, out-of-distribution performance, and the generalization gap? Is there an optimal value?

10. The paper focuses on analyzing SFT, RLHF, and best-of-N sampling. How do other recently proposed methods for LLM fine-tuning such as CoOp or RED compare in terms of generalization and diversity? Might they provide a better balance?
