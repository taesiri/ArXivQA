# [DREAM: Diffusion Rectification and Estimation-Adaptive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown promising performance for image super-resolution (SR). However, there exists a discrepancy between the training and sampling processes of DPMs for SR:
- Training operates on ground truth data, constructing noisy images from clean references.  
- Sampling lacks access to ground truth, instead using model predictions to iteratively construct noisy inputs.
This discrepancy causes error accumulation that limits DPM performance for SR in practice.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DREAM, a simple yet effective framework to bridge the training-sampling gap in DPMs, requiring only 3 additional lines of code. DREAM has two main components:

1. Diffusion Rectification: Extends diffusion training to align more closely with sampling. Uses model predictions as input to impose additional supervision that accounts for the discrepancy. However, solely relying on self-predictions compromises perceptual quality.  

2. Estimation Adaptation: Balances standard diffusion training and diffusion rectification. Adaptively blends ground truth data and model predictions guided by the pattern of estimation errors. This harmonizes advantages of both strategies.

Together, diffusion rectification and estimation adaptation effectively reduce the training-sampling discrepancy. The adaptive blending mechanism smoothly focuses training on ground truth when predictions are strong, and on self-predictions when they are weaker.

Main Contributions:
- Propose DREAM, a simple yet effective strategy to bridge training-sampling discrepancy in diffusion models.
- Demonstrate DREAM's application to enhance various diffusion-based SR methods across face, natural, and scene image datasets. Results show lower distortion, improved perceptual quality, faster convergence, and greater sampling efficiency.
- Establish superior OOD generalization ability over existing diffusion SR methods.
- Reveal state-of-the-art capabilities for diffusion-based SR using extremely simple code changes, inspiring rethinking of prevailing training paradigms.

In summary, DREAM adeptly navigates the distortion-perception tradeoff in diffusion-based SR through its rectification and adaptive estimation strategies. It delivers consistent and substantial improvements across diverse model architectures, training objectives, and dataset distributions.
