# [Preuve de concept d'un bot vocal dialoguant en wolof](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In Senegal, French is the official language but only spoken by a minority (less than 25% of the population). The majority speaks and understands Wolof (90% of the population).
- Currently, chatbots and voice assistants are mostly available in developed countries and major languages. Building them for African languages is challenging due to lack of resources.  
- There is a need for a Wolof voice assistant so that Senegalese people can access information by voice in their native language.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a proof-of-concept for the first automatic voice assistant in Wolof language. 
- The voicebot takes speech input from a user, processes it through an ASR engine to transcribe the speech, feeds the text into an NLU system to determine intent, and returns a relevant pre-recorded audio response to the user.

Key Details:
- The ASR system uses a hybrid architecture with a TDNN acoustic model and 5-gram language model. It was trained on 44 hours of Wolof speech data.
- The NLU module uses the open-source Rasa framework. Intents and entities are extracted using a DIET classifier. 
- The dialogue manager uses rule-based and ML-based policies to determine next actions.
- For the voice response, pre-recorded clips are used rather than speech synthesis.

Main Contributions:
- First ever Wolof voicebot demonstrating feasibility of building voice assistants for African languages
- Description of methodology and data used to develop core components (ASR, NLU, dialogue manager)
- Quantitative evaluation - 22% WER for ASR, 78% F1-score for NLU intent detection
- Analysis of real user tests with Orange employees to improve systems before public beta testing

The paper discusses the main challenges in dealing with under-resourced African languages. It provides details on the datasets used and results obtained at each stage. Initial user feedback indicates the need for improving speech and language understanding. Future work includes upgrading the systems and adding dynamic response generation.
