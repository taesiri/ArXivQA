# [Wav2Gloss: Generating Interlinear Glossed Text from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Thousands of the world's languages are endangered, posing a threat to cultural identities and linguistic diversity. Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) can help document and create resources for these languages, but manually creating IGT from speech is extremely time-consuming. 
- This paper introduces the task of automatically generating IGT annotations (transcription, morphology, glosses, translation) directly from speech to help expedite endangered language documentation.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce the first speech dataset for this wav2gloss task, called Fieldwork. It contains over 70 hours of speech data for 37 languages from 5 different archives, formatted and split into train/dev/test.
- They benchmark performance on 4 subtasks - transcription, underlying form, glossing, and translation prediction - using end-to-end speech models (WavLM, XLS-R, OWSM) and cascaded ASR->text models (ByT5).
- Both multi-task and single-task setups are evaluated. The models are analyzed to study trends related to pre-trained knowledge and multilinguality.

Main Contributions:
- Definition of a new wav2gloss task to generate IGT annotations from speech 
- Introduction of the Fieldwork benchmark dataset with 70+ hours of multilingual speech data and IGT annotations
- Benchmarks for transcription, underlying form, gloss and translation prediction using end-to-end and cascaded approaches
- Analysis providing insights about model design choices like pre-training, multi-task learning etc. for this low-resource setting

The paper lays the groundwork to build technologies that can assist with time-consuming IGT creation, helping expedite endangered language documentation and preservation. The benchmarks and analyses also identify challenges unique to multilingual low-resource settings that can guide future work.
