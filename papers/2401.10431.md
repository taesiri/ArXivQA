# [Learning a Prior for Monte Carlo Search by Replaying Solutions to   Combinatorial Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Addressed:
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) works very well for many combinatorial problems, but can be improved significantly by using a prior (non-uniform heuristic) during playouts. Manually designed heuristics tailored for each problem have been used in the past, but require extensive domain expertise. This paper proposes an automatic way to learn a prior from solved instances of a problem.

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to generate many solved problem instances along with their solutions, and replay the solutions to gather statistics. Specifically, they count for each possible move in each state:
- nb[move] = number of times the move was possible 
- count[move] = number times the move was part of a solution

Then the prior for a move is: 
prior = τ * log (count[move]/nb[move])
where τ is a temperature parameter. This prior is then used in a softmax distribution during Monte Carlo playouts.

The process is very general and works for three challenging problems - Latin Square Completion, Kakuro puzzles, and RNA Inverse Folding. For each problem, they show how to easily generate solved instances, compute the priors from replay, and demonstrate substantial improvements over uniform Monte Carlo playouts.

Key Contributions:
- A simple and general technique to automatically learn informative priors for Monte Carlo Tree Search from existing solved problem instances
- Demonstrated significant performance gains on three difficult combinatorial problems without any domain specific heuristics
- For RNA Inverse Folding, the automatically learned prior outperforms a complex manually designed heuristic from prior work
- The technique has negligible overhead during Monte Carlo playouts

In summary, this paper delivers a broadly applicable method to improve Monte Carlo methods by learning from prior solutions to problems. The efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple hard problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a general method to automatically learn a prior for Monte Carlo search by replaying solutions to combinatorial problems and using the statistics of moves as a bias, and shows it significantly improves performance on Latin Square Completion, Kakuro puzzles, and Inverse RNA Folding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method to automatically compute a prior for Monte Carlo search by replaying solutions to combinatorial problems. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a general method to learn a prior for Monte Carlo search algorithms by calculating statistics on moves in solved combinatorial problems. This enables creating a bias that can guide the search.

- The prior is computed by replaying solutions to sample problems and counting the frequency each move has been part of a solution or has been possible. This statistics are then used to calculate a bias for each move.

- The method incurs negligible computational cost during sampling, since the statistics are precomputed. However, it brings large performance gains to Monte Carlo search on three hard combinatorial problems that are tested: Latin Square Completion, Kakuro and Inverse RNA Folding.

- The learned priors significantly outperform default Monte Carlo search without a prior and handcrafted priors. The method is general and can be easily applied to other combinatorial problems.

In summary, the key contribution is an automatic way to learn an effective yet cheap prior to guide Monte Carlo search algorithms by replaying solutions to sample problems, with demonstrated gains on hard problems. The method is simple, general and improves substantially over default Monte Carlo search.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Nested Monte Carlo Search (NMCS) 
- Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA)
- Generalized NRPA (GNRPA)
- Prior
- Latin Square Completion (LSC)
- Kakuro
- Inverse RNA Folding
- Combinatorial problems
- Gibbs sampling
- Policy adaptation
- Playout policy

The paper discusses using learned priors to improve Monte Carlo tree search methods like NMCS, NRPA, and GNRPA for solving hard combinatorial problems. It looks at computing a prior automatically from statistics on solved problems and shows results on three problems - Latin Square Completion, Kakuro puzzles, and Inverse RNA Folding. The prior helps guide the playout policy to sample better solutions. Key ideas involve Gibbs sampling, adapting the policy by reinforcing good move sequences, and learning from previous solved instances.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method of learning a prior by replaying solutions compare to other methods of learning priors or heuristics for Monte Carlo Tree Search, such as online learning? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper mentions that the method could be improved by using more elaborate codes for moves when calculating the priors. What kinds of additional information could be incorporated into these codes and how might that improve performance? 

3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of temperature parameter τ? Does the optimal value vary significantly across problem instances and domains? How could this parameter be set automatically?

4. The method relies on the ability to easily generate solved problem instances. For what types of combinatorial problems would this be difficult and how could the approach be adapted?

5. Could the use of more sophisticated statistical models beyond relative frequencies (such as neural networks) for learning priors provide benefits? What challenges might this introduce?

6. How does the performance of the learned prior compare to hand-designed priors from human experts? In what ways does it excel or fall short?

7. What theoretical guarantees, if any, does this method for learning priors provide in terms of search performance? Under what conditions is it provably beneficial?

8. How does the computational overhead of learning scale as the problem size increases? At what point does it become a bottleneck?

9. In what ways could the learned prior be analyzed to provide human-interpretable insights into a combinatorial problem? Could this facilitate the design of better hand-coded heuristics?

10. What modifications would enable this method of learning priors to be applied successfully to stochastic or partially observable environments? What new challenges would this introduce?
