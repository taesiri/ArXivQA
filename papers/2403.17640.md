# [REFeREE: A REference-FREE Model-Based Metric for Text Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Text simplification lacks a universal standard for evaluation. Reference simplified texts are scarce, costly to produce and evaluate against. This creates bottlenecks for developing text simplification systems. 
- Existing reference-based metrics like BLEU, SARI and BERTScore correlate poorly with human evaluations of quality.
- There is a need for reliable reference-free evaluation metrics for text simplification.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes REFeREE, a reference-free model-based metric for evaluating text simplifications. 
- REFeREE uses a 3-stage curriculum with scalable pretraining using reference-free signals, pretraining with reference-based signals, and fine-tuning on human ratings.
- The first stage allows leveraging large amounts of unlabeled text. The second stage uses available simplified reference texts. The third stage aligns the metric to human judgements of quality.

Main Contributions:
- REFeREE outperforms prior metrics in predicting overall human ratings while requiring no references at inference time.
- On predicting specific aspects like adequacy and simplicity, REFeREE is more consistent across datasets compared to other metrics.
- The proposed curriculum with scalable pretraining enables creating effective metrics despite limited availability of human annotations.
- REFeREE demonstrates the promise of reference-free model-based metrics for text simplification evaluation.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes REFeREE, a reference-free model-based metric for evaluating text simplification quality that uses a 3-stage curriculum including arbitrary-scale pretraining and fine-tuning on human ratings to overcome the bottleneck caused by lack of reference simplifications while achieving strong correlation with human judgements of overall and specific quality aspects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing REFeREE, a reference-free model-based metric for evaluating text simplification systems. Key points about REFeREE include:

- It uses a 3-stage curriculum with scalable pretraining on synthesized data to overcome the limitation of scarce human ratings for text simplification. 

- It is flexible and can be fine-tuned to different quality standards and evaluation criteria as long as some human annotations are available.

- Experiments show it outperforms existing reference-based metrics in predicting overall human ratings of simplification quality, while reaching competitive performance on specific aspects like adequacy, fluency and simplicity.

- It requires no reference simplifications at inference time, making it applicable even when human references are impossible to collect.

So in summary, the main novelty is developing a reference-free evaluation metric for text simplification that leverages scalable pretraining and fine-tuning to provide quality estimates correlated with human judgments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a 3-stage curriculum for training the REFeREE metric. Can you explain the motivation and purpose behind each training stage? What are the key differences between the stages?

2) In the first pretraining stage, the paper uses a variety of reference-free supervision signals related to meaning preservation, fluency, and simplicity. What is the rationale behind choosing these specific signals? How do they complement each other? 

3) The paper mentions augmenting 40% of the system outputs in the first pretraining stage. What types of augmentations are used and why? How does augmentation help improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model?

4) The second pretraining stage incorporates reference-based signals like BLEU, SARI and BERTScore. How does adding these reference-based signals in pretraining help, given that the final metric is reference-free?

5) The paper experiments with both DeBERTa-v3-base and RoBERTa-large backbones. What are the tradeoffs in using larger vs smaller models as the backbone? When might one be preferred over the other?

6) In the ablation studies, the paper finds that the fluency and simplicity signals have a bigger impact on performance compared to the meaning preservation signals. Why might that be the case for the SimpEval2022 dataset used?

7) The REFeREE metric performs well on SimpEval but is less consistent across Simplicity-DA and Human-Likert. What could explain these differences in performance across datasets?

8) The paper discusses differences in REFeREE's performance when evaluating human vs machine simplifications. What factors might account for these differences? How can the discrepancy be addressed?

9) Could the proposed method and architecture be applied to other text generation tasks like summarization? What modifications might be required?

10) The paper mentions limitations regarding domains, languages, and setups. How could the reference-free pretraining approach be extended to improve generalization across these factors?
