# [REFeREE: A REference-FREE Model-Based Metric for Text Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Text simplification lacks a universal standard for evaluation. Reference simplified texts are scarce, costly to produce and evaluate against. This creates bottlenecks for developing text simplification systems. 
- Existing reference-based metrics like BLEU, SARI and BERTScore correlate poorly with human evaluations of quality.
- There is a need for reliable reference-free evaluation metrics for text simplification.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes REFeREE, a reference-free model-based metric for evaluating text simplifications. 
- REFeREE uses a 3-stage curriculum with scalable pretraining using reference-free signals, pretraining with reference-based signals, and fine-tuning on human ratings.
- The first stage allows leveraging large amounts of unlabeled text. The second stage uses available simplified reference texts. The third stage aligns the metric to human judgements of quality.

Main Contributions:
- REFeREE outperforms prior metrics in predicting overall human ratings while requiring no references at inference time.
- On predicting specific aspects like adequacy and simplicity, REFeREE is more consistent across datasets compared to other metrics.
- The proposed curriculum with scalable pretraining enables creating effective metrics despite limited availability of human annotations.
- REFeREE demonstrates the promise of reference-free model-based metrics for text simplification evaluation.
