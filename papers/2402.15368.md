# [Safe Task Planning for Language-Instructed Multi-Robot Systems using   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper addresses the problem of task planning for teams of robots that are given instructions in natural language (NL). 
- Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate robot plans from NL, but lack performance guarantees and can produce unsafe/incorrect outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new decentralized planner based on LLMs that can achieve user-specified task success rates.  
- Each robot is assigned an LLM agent that selects actions via a multiple choice framework, restricting choices to valid options to mitigate hallucination risks.  
- Conformal prediction is used to construct prediction sets that contain the ground truth action with high probability. Non-singleton sets indicate uncertainty, triggering requests for help.
- Robots coordinate by communicating context histories to select actions sequentially. Theoretical analysis shows this method meets target success rates.

Main Contributions:
- First decentralized LLM-based planner for multi-robot teams that provides user-specified correctness guarantees.
- Leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in a decentralized manner. Enables robots to seek help when uncertain. 
- Empirical comparisons show the method outperforms recent centralized and decentralized baselines, with increasing advantages as complexity and robot team size grows.
- Provides theoretical analysis to demonstrate achievement of desired mission success rates based on constructed prediction sets.

In summary, the key novelty is a decentralized planning approach for language-instructed robot teams that notably provides correctness guarantees lacking in prior LLM-based methods. Conformal prediction enables customizable reliability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a decentralized planner for language-instructed multi-robot teams that can achieve user-specified task success rates by leveraging conformal prediction to reason about model uncertainty and request human assistance when needed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is summarized as follows:

(i) It proposes the first decentralized planner for language-instructed multi-robot systems that can achieve user-specified task success rates.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed planner leverage coordinate descent methods to enable decentralized construction of multi-robot plans? What are the key benefits of this decentralized approach compared to centralized planners?

2. Explain in detail how conformal prediction is applied in this work to construct prediction sets for the actions of each robot in a decentralized manner. What theoretical guarantees does this provide?
