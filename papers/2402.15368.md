# [Safe Task Planning for Language-Instructed Multi-Robot Systems using   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper addresses the problem of task planning for teams of robots that are given instructions in natural language (NL). 
- Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate robot plans from NL, but lack performance guarantees and can produce unsafe/incorrect outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new decentralized planner based on LLMs that can achieve user-specified task success rates.  
- Each robot is assigned an LLM agent that selects actions via a multiple choice framework, restricting choices to valid options to mitigate hallucination risks.  
- Conformal prediction is used to construct prediction sets that contain the ground truth action with high probability. Non-singleton sets indicate uncertainty, triggering requests for help.
- Robots coordinate by communicating context histories to select actions sequentially. Theoretical analysis shows this method meets target success rates.

Main Contributions:
- First decentralized LLM-based planner for multi-robot teams that provides user-specified correctness guarantees.
- Leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in a decentralized manner. Enables robots to seek help when uncertain. 
- Empirical comparisons show the method outperforms recent centralized and decentralized baselines, with increasing advantages as complexity and robot team size grows.
- Provides theoretical analysis to demonstrate achievement of desired mission success rates based on constructed prediction sets.

In summary, the key novelty is a decentralized planning approach for language-instructed robot teams that notably provides correctness guarantees lacking in prior LLM-based methods. Conformal prediction enables customizable reliability.
