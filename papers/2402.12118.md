# [DualView: Data Attribution from the Dual Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make machine learning model decisions interpretable. A major area in XAI is local data attribution, which explains a model's prediction on a test input by determining the influence of individual training data points. Existing methods for local data attribution either have high computational demands, do not perform well across different evaluation criteria, or suffer from both issues. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes DualView, a new local data attribution method based on decomposing the model output using a margin-maximizing kernel SVM surrogate model. The SVM uses the penultimate layer representations of the neural network being explained as its kernel. 

The paper evaluates DualView against prominent existing methods like Influence Functions, Representer Point Selection, and Similarity Metrics using quantitative evaluation metrics from literature. These metrics measure usefulness for cleaning poisoned datasets, detecting distribution mismatches, and similarity between test inputs and influential training inputs.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of DualView, an efficient and configurable local data attribution method demonstrating strong performance across different evaluation criteria

2) Analysis of the effects of a key hyperparameter of DualView that allows tuning the sparsity of explanations 

3) Formulation of two new evaluation metrics for local data attribution methods

4) First technique to combine local data attribution with local feature attribution, explaining model decisions in terms of influential test input features and training input features

5) Evaluation of DualView against state-of-the-art local data attribution methods using existing and newly formulated metrics, showing DualView's computational efficiency and strong performance

The paper makes both methodological and empirical contributions for explainable AI through the proposal and extensive evaluation of the DualView local data attribution technique.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called DualView for efficiently and accurately explaining which training data points influence a neural network's predictions on test data, evaluates it against other methods, and shows how to combine it with feature attribution to explain predictions in terms of influential features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing DualView, a new local data attribution method based on decomposing the model output using a margin maximizing kernel surrogate classifier that utilizes the final hidden layer representations.

2) Presenting an analysis of the effects of various hyperparameter ranges for DualView.

3) Formulating two new evaluation metrics that measure the ability of explanations to help clean datasets with poisoned labels or detect Clever Hans predictions. 

4) Evaluating DualView against other prominent data attribution methods using these new metrics as well as existing metrics, finding that DualView is very efficient computationally while also performing competitively across the evaluation metrics.

5) Proposing to combine DualView with local feature attribution methods to provide explanations highlighting influential training samples as well as the features on those samples and the test sample responsible for their impact.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing the DualView method, evaluating it comprehensively, and showing how it can be combined with feature attribution to provide more informative explanations. The key aspects that set DualView apart are its efficiency, tunable sparsity, and ability to provide feature-level explanations when combined with other methods.
