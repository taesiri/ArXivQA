# [T-Eval: Evaluating the Tool Utilization Capability Step by Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and analyzing the tool utilization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is still an open challenge. 
- Existing benchmarks rely on real-time tool interactions, which can introduce external factors that impact evaluation fairness. 
- Current benchmarks also evaluate models holistically, lacking analysis of intermediate steps in the tool usage process.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces T-Eval, a new benchmark that decomposes tool utilization evaluation into distinct sub-tasks testing core abilities.
- T-Eval maps tool usage to six key aspects: planning, reasoning, retrieval, understanding, instruction following, and review.
- Dedicated test cases and prompts are designed to evaluate each ability dimension separately.

Main Contributions:
- T-Eval enables fine-grained analysis of bottleneck areas in an LLM's tool utilization skills.  
- Testing is conducted offline using expert human annotations, enhancing stability.
- Analysis shows T-Eval reveals bottlenecks related to reasoning, retrieval, and review abilities in current LLMs.
- Benchmark results are consistent with downstream task performance, validating effectiveness.
- Over 20 LLMs evaluated, including GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, and more to demonstrate generalizability.  

In summary, T-Eval advances LLM tool utilization testing through step-wise, ability-focused evaluation protocols on human-verified data, enabling detailed analysis lacking in prior benchmark designs.
