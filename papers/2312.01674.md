# [EDALearn: A Comprehensive RTL-to-Signoff EDA Benchmark for Democratized   and Reproducible ML for EDA Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The application of machine learning (ML) in electronic design automation (EDA) has garnered significant interest recently. However, most studies are limited to small, internally generated datasets due to the lack of comprehensive public benchmarks. This hinders the development and evaluation of effective ML solutions for EDA problems. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces EDALearn, the first complete, open-source benchmark suite designed specifically for ML tasks in EDA research. EDALearn provides an end-to-end flow from synthesis to physical implementation and collects extensive data across multiple stages. It is based on the FreePDK 45nm and ASAP 7nm technology nodes and supports tasks like routability prediction, IR drop prediction, and cross-stage analysis.

The benchmark includes a diverse set of real-world VLSI designs and synthesizes them with different configurations. Both image-like spatial features and vector statistics are extracted to represent circuit designs. EDALearn covers critical EDA tasks like timing analysis, power prediction, routability checks, and IR drop estimation. It also enables cross-stage data analysis to compare tool estimations across different stages.

Main Contributions:

- First holistic, open-source benchmark suite for ML-EDA with end-to-end flow and comprehensive data collection
- Enables research on ML transferability across technology nodes through open-source flow 
- Accommodates diverse VLSI designs, more representative of complexity in modern designs
- Provides in-depth data analysis for understanding data distribution and characteristics
- Fosters collaboration through standardized evaluation framework and encourages ML innovations for EDA

The benchmark aims to steer progress in ML-EDA research by providing a unified platform for performance evaluation and knowledge sharing.
