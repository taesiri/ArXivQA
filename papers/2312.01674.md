# [EDALearn: A Comprehensive RTL-to-Signoff EDA Benchmark for Democratized   and Reproducible ML for EDA Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01674)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces EDALearn, a new comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating machine learning techniques applied to electronic design automation (EDA) tasks. EDALearn provides an end-to-end flow from synthesis to physical implementation, with extensive data collection across multiple stages. It is based on real-world FreePDK 45nm and ASAP 7nm technology nodes and includes a diverse set of design instances. A key highlight is the incorporation of numerous variations in the synthesis and physical implementation flows, enabling a thorough analysis of ML model performance across different scenarios. Rich feature representations are offered, including both image-like spatial distributions and vector statistics of circuit components. Supported tasks encompass critical EDA applications like power prediction, timing analysis, routability checks and IR drop estimation. The benchmark further enables cross-stage data analysis to uncover optimizations across the design flow. Detailed data analysis is provided, shedding light on trade-offs between timing, power and design stages at advanced nodes. By facilitating standardized evaluation, collaboration and ML advancements, the proposed EDALearn suite marks an important milestone in strengthening the integration of machine learning into electronic design automation.
