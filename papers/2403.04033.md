# [Online Learning with Unknown Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of online learning where the actions chosen by the learner need to satisfy an unknown safety constraint at every round. The goal is to minimize regret compared to the best safe action in hindsight, while simultaneously ensuring the safety constraints are satisfied with high probability at each timestep. This is challenging since the constraint functions are unknown.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a meta-algorithm that utilizes two oracles - (1) an online regression oracle that provides estimates of the unknown constraint functions (2) an online learning oracle that provides actions to optimize losses without regard to safety. 

The meta-algorithm maintains confidence sets on the constraint functions based on the regression oracle's predictions. Using these, it constructs "optimistic" sets that contain all safe actions with high probability, and "pessimistic" sets that are guaranteed to be safe. The optimistic sets are passed to the online learning oracle to get actions that minimize regret. These actions are then mapped to the pessimistic set to ensure safety.   

A key component is a mapping that trades off between minimizing losses and gaining more information about the constraints. The regret bound depends on the regret of the two oracles, the eluder dimension of the function class, and a novel complexity measure that captures the inherent explore-exploit tradeoff.

Main Contributions:

- A general meta-algorithm for safe online learning with unknown constraints that leverages online regression and online learning oracles

- Regret analysis in terms of complexities of the oracles and function classes, along with a new complexity measure capturing safety-regret tradeoffs

- Asymptotic lower bound showing necessity of the new complexity measure

- Instantiation to linear constraints, attaining O(âˆšT) regret improving upon state-of-the-art O(T^(2/3)) regret

In summary, the paper provides a novel general framework and analysis for safe online learning with unknown constraints, along with concrete algorithms for linear settings. The regret bounds highlight the key challenges in balancing safety and performance.
