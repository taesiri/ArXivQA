## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address data sparsity in one domain by transferring knowledge from a related data-rich domain. Existing CDR methods have two key limitations: (1) They rely solely on user-item interactions to extract domain-common and domain-specific features, which is insufficient for effective disentanglement. (2) They overlook privacy concerns during knowledge transfer, risking the leakage of sensitive user information.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes P2M2-CDR, a privacy-preserving CDR framework with multi-modal data. It contains two key components:

1. Multi-Modal Disentangled Encoder: Leverages user reviews, item textual/visual features (in addition to interactions) to learn comprehensive user/item representations and disentangle more informative domain-common and domain-specific user embeddings.  

2. Privacy-Preserving Decoder: Employs local differential privacy to perturb disentangled embeddings before inter-domain transfer. Uses contrastive learning to align domain-common and separate domain-specific embeddings post perturbation. Finally, aggregates perturbed disentangled embeddings into private comprehensive user preferences.

Main Contributions:

- Incorporates multi-modal data to effectively disentangle informative domain-common and domain-specific user representations for enhanced CDR.

- Utilizes local differential privacy to perturb disentangled embeddings before inter-domain sharing, safeguarding against leakage of sensitive user information.

- Outperforms state-of-the-art CDR methods on four real-world datasets while preserving privacy.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative multi-modal disentanglement approach and privacy-preserving transfer mechanism to enhance CDR accuracy while protecting user privacy.
