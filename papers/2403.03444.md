# [Uncertainty quantification for deeponets with ensemble kalman inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Operator learning aims to learn unknown mappings between input and output functions, with DeepONets being a popular architecture. However, assessing uncertainty in DeepONet predictions is critical for reliability, especially with limited or noisy data.
- Existing Bayesian DeepONet methods like HMC or VI have challenges around computational expense or approximation quality. So there is a need for efficient and informative UQ methods tailored for DeepONets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for UQ with DeepONets. EKI has advantages like being derivative-free, noise-robust, parallelizable, and suited for high-dimensional parameters.
- EKI formulates the problem in a Bayesian framework with priors, likelihoods and posteriors. It maintains an ensemble of DeepONets and iteratively corrects them based on discrepancies with data.
- To accommodate large datasets, a mini-batch EKI variant is used which subsamples the data in each iteration.
- A heuristic approach is introduced to learn the covariance of the artificial dynamics, to prevent ensemble collapse while minimizing excessive parameter perturbation.

Main Contributions:
- First application of EKI for uncertainty quantification with DeepONets.
- Mini-batch EKI allows scaling to larger datasets by managing complexity relative to subsample size.
- Learning the artificial dynamics covariance prevents ensemble collapse while enabling reasonable uncertainty estimates.
- Evaluated on various benchmark problems with different noise levels. Demonstrates efficient inference and informative uncertainty estimates.
- Establishes EKI as an effective method for UQ with DeepONets, with the potential to address pressing challenges especially with limited/noisy data.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in efficiently quantifying uncertainty for DeepONets in practical scenarios, by creatively adapting the Ensemble Kalman Inversion technique.
