# [A Survey on Structure-Preserving Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on graph representation learning. However, they have limitations such as over-smoothing and inability to capture long-range dependencies. Recent graph transformer models have been proposed as an alternative, but they lack the ability to preserve graph structure information which is crucial for many applications. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of structure-preserving graph transformer models. It categorizes the methods into four main strategies:

1. Node feature modulation: Inject structural information like Laplacian eigenvectors or random walk based features into initial node features so transformers can differentiate nodes based on structure.

2. Context node sampling: Sample neighborhoods within k-hops to preserve local structure connectivity. Some methods also sample nodes globally using similarity measures to capture long-range dependencies.  

3. Graph rewriting: Rewrite the graph by adding edges or nodes so transformers can better capture structural correlations between distant nodes. Strategies include graph coarsening and adding virtual edges.

4. Transformer architecture improvements: Enhance architecture to incorporate structure information e.g. adding GNN layers so local structure can be aggregated or directly encoding structure in the attention mechanism.

Main Contributions:

- Provides a systematic categorization and analysis of structure preserving graph transformer models based on their core strategy and objective

- Discusses concept of structural identification v/s similarity and need to balance both 

- Highlights limitations of current methods in terms of geometric equivariance and scalability

- Gives potential future research directions like developing intrinsically geometric equivariant transformers and approximate methods to improve scalability

Overall, the paper delivers a comprehensive survey to understand and advance research in developing graph transformers that can effectively preserve and leverage structural information in graphs.
