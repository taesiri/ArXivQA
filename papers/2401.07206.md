# [Probabilistic Reduced-Dimensional Vector Autoregressive Modeling with   Oblique Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
With the increasing deployment of sensors and data collection systems, high-dimensional time series data with low-dimensional underlying dynamics are becoming prevalent. Traditional time series models like VAR are not suitable for such data. This calls for parsimonious models that can extract the low-dimensional dynamics from noisy high-dimensional data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Probabilistic Reduced-dimensional Vector Autoregressive (PredVAR) model with oblique projections to decompose the measurement space into a low-dimensional subspace containing the dynamics and a complementary subspace containing static noise. 

The PredVAR model consists of two interrelated components - the outer projection model that partitions the measurement space using oblique projections and an inner VAR model that captures the dynamics in the low-dimensional subspace.

An iterative algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization is developed to estimate the model parameters. It alternately updates the estimates of the latent dynamics and optimal oblique projection to maximize data likelihood. 

Main Contributions:

1) A PredVAR model with general oblique projections is proposed for low-dimensional dynamic modeling from high-dimensional data. The model is shown to be equivalent to a reduced-rank VAR model.

2) An optimal oblique projection is derived to achieve best predictability in terms of prediction error covariance. Ordered dynamic latent variables based on predictability are also obtained.  

3) An identification algorithm for PredVAR using EM method is developed that enforces consistency between the outer projection and inner VAR model. It also estimates the noise covariance matrices.

4) The superior performance of PredVAR over benchmarks like LaVAR, DiCCA and one-shot solutions is demonstrated on synthesized Lorenz system data and Eastman process data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a probabilistic reduced-dimensional vector autoregressive (PredVAR) modeling approach to extract low-dimensional dynamics from high-dimensional noisy time series data using an oblique projection to optimally partition the measurement space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new probabilistic reduced-dimensional vector autoregressive (PredVAR) model to extract low-dimensional dynamics from high-dimensional noisy data. The main contributions are:

1) It formulates a PredVAR model with general oblique projections to partition the measurement space into a low-dimensional dynamic subspace and a complementary static subspace. 

2) It derives an optimal oblique projection for the best predictability in terms of prediction error covariance. This leads to an uncorrelated realization between the dynamic and static subspaces.  

3) It develops an iterative PredVAR algorithm based on maximum likelihood and the EM framework to alternately update the estimates of the latent dynamics and optimal oblique projection. 

4) It demonstrates the superior performance and efficiency of PredVAR using data sets from a synthesized Lorenz system and an industrial process compared to other methods like LaVAR-CCA and DiCCA.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of the PredVAR model and algorithm to extract optimal low-dimensional dynamics with oblique projections for high-dimensional time series analysis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes an iterative algorithm involving an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure to identify the PredVAR model parameters. Can you elaborate on the details of the E-step and M-step and how they enable the simultaneous estimation of the outer oblique projection and inner VAR dynamics? 

2) The optimal dynamic-static decomposition is shown to yield uncorrelated noise terms. What is the intuition behind this result? Can you explain the geometric interpretation provided in Section IV-B and how it relates to the uncorrelated noise condition?

3) How does the PredVAR model handle rank deficient covariance matrices for the innovations, as may occur in practice? What modifications need to be made to the proposed algorithm?

4) Theorem 1 shows that the PredVAR model is equivalent to a reduced rank VAR model. Can you explain the details of this equivalence result and discuss if/why one might prefer the PredVAR parameterization over the reduced rank VAR?  

5) How does the PredVAR model initialization strategy relate to the canonical analysis of time series method proposed by Box and Tiao (1977)? What are the connections and differences? 

6) The paper compares the PredVAR algorithm to several other methods including LaVAR-CCA and DiCCA. Can you summarize the key similarities and differences between these methods in terms of problem formulation, parameters estimated, and algorithm details? 

7) What assumptions need to be satisfied for the distributions of the PredVAR parameter estimates to hold, as discussed in Section V-A? How can the variance of these estimates be assessed?

8) Explain the derivation of the reduced-rank multiple final prediction error (RRMFPE) criterion for determining the PredVAR model order. How does this differ from traditional MFPE for full-order VAR models?

9) Compare and contrast the proposed iterative PredVAR algorithm to the one-shot dimension reduction solutions discussed in Section V-C. What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches? 

10) How does the PredVAR model handle situations where the measurement vector covariance matrix is singular, indicating redundant sensors? What changes need to be made to the algorithm in this case?
