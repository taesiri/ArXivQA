# [Fingerprinting New York City's Scaffolding Problem with Longitudinal   Dashcam Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scaffolds (sidewalk sheds) are temporary structures used to protect pedestrians during construction, but many remain up for years in NYC, becoming eyesores and accessibility issues. 
- There are over 8,000 active scaffold permits in NYC currently, but many problematic scaffolds are likely expired/unpermitted. 
- The city needs better ways to identify and track scaffolds over time across neighborhoods.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a longitudinal dataset of 29 million NYC dashcam images from Aug 2023-Jan 2024. 
- Train a YOLOv7 model to detect scaffolds in images. Obtains 78% recall and 79% precision.
- Design an algorithm to match detections to scaffold permits and confirm scaffold presence over multiple sightings.
- Map scaffold detections over time throughout NYC neighborhoods.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate usefulness of crowdsourced dashcam data for passive, large-scale urban sensing over time.
- Develop methods tailored for longitudinal analysis of static urban infrastructure.
- Identify scaffolding hotspots and trends across neighborhoods.
- Match 85% of active permits to model detections.
- Estimate 9.3% of detected scaffolds are unpermitted.
- Framework enables targeted inspections and innovations for city agencies.
- Brings awareness to NYC's problematic long-term scaffolding issue.

In summary, the paper shows how dashcam data enables sensing static urban elements over time, using sidewalk sheds in NYC as a case study. The methods map scaffolding prevalence across boroughs and estimate unpermitted structures to potentially assist city agencies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a computer vision pipeline to detect sidewalk scaffolds in New York City from dashcam imagery, enabling the longitudinal mapping and tracking of scaffolding to identify problematic structures that persist for years beyond permits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The demonstration of crowdsourced dashcam data as a medium that elevates the state-of-the-art for passive urban sensing. Specifically, the paper shows that longitudinal dashcam data can be used to sense the presence of sidewalk scaffolds in NYC over time, including tracking how long different scaffolds have been in place. This goes beyond simply detecting if a scaffold is present, enabling new ways to monitor the urban built environment. The paper develops methods tailored to leverage the temporal density of dashcam data for this purpose. Overall, it highlights the potential of dashcam data to canvas sidewalk-level activity at scale to help address urban issues.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Scaffolding - The paper focuses on detecting sidewalk sheds/scaffolds in New York City using computer vision methods. This is the main object of interest.

- Dashcam - The paper utilizes a dataset of crowdsourced dashcam images from rideshare vehicles to detect scaffolds throughout NYC over time. Dashcam data is a key enabler of the analysis. 

- Object detection - A YOLOv7 object detection model is trained to recognize scaffolds in street-level dashcam imagery. Object detection is the core computer vision task.

- Longitudinal analysis - The temporal density of the dashcam data allows the authors to confirm scaffold detections over multiple sightings, enabling an assessment of how long scaffolds have been erected.

- Permit compliance - Detected scaffolds are matched to a public database of permitted scaffolding locations, facilitating an audit of proper permitting. 

- Urban sensing - The project demonstrates the capability of dashcams for passive, city-scale sensing of infrastructure and built environment objects.

In summary, key terms include scaffolding, dashcam, object detection, longitudinal analysis, permit compliance, and urban sensing. The paper showcases computer vision and crowdsourced data for studying an urban policy issue.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper relies on active permit data from the NYC Department of Buildings to filter images for the training set. How might this impact the model's ability to generalize to unpermitted or expired scaffolding? Could an alternative sampling strategy improve generalization?

2. The paper combines white and green scaffolds into a single class due to the low prevalence of white scaffolds. How might a multi-class model, trained on a stratified dataset, enable deeper analysis into scaffold types? What further insights could emerge?

3. The grid-based mapping of detections to scaffold instances uses an 80ft x 80ft cell size, which is then grouped into 320ft x 320ft areas. How was this cell size chosen? Is there room for optimization in the grouping approach to better distinguish dense concentrations of scaffolds?  

4. The paper establishes a tagging algorithm to confirm scaffolds through repeated detection over time. How was the 20-day window size determined? Could a dynamic or adaptive window improve accuracy as data accumulates over longer time periods?

5. Precision is prioritized over recall in the supervised learning model. How does this impact scaffolding in areas with low rideshare coverage? Could a recall-focused model enable better analysis in outer boroughs?

6. The out-of-distribution analysis mentions evaluating performance on scaffolds in other cities globally. What annotation strategies could enable efficient labeling at scale across countries and scaffolding norms?

7. Distillation is proposed for on-edge deployment on camera fleets. What are the key tradeoffs between efficiency, accuracy and privacy for such real-time analysis? How can they be balanced?

8. The paper identifies 529 likely unpermitted scaffoldings. How can this signal be further refined to account for emergency exemptions or other exceptional regulatory allowances?

9. How do the temporal dynamics in the dashcam dataset enable new insights into scaffolding compliance over static datasets? What new compliance questions can now be posed?  

10. Beyond government agencies, how can longitudinal scaffold mapping empower citizens and community groups to advocate for scaffold regulation and oversight?
