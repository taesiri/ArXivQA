# [Fingerprinting New York City's Scaffolding Problem with Longitudinal   Dashcam Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scaffolds (sidewalk sheds) are temporary structures used to protect pedestrians during construction, but many remain up for years in NYC, becoming eyesores and accessibility issues. 
- There are over 8,000 active scaffold permits in NYC currently, but many problematic scaffolds are likely expired/unpermitted. 
- The city needs better ways to identify and track scaffolds over time across neighborhoods.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a longitudinal dataset of 29 million NYC dashcam images from Aug 2023-Jan 2024. 
- Train a YOLOv7 model to detect scaffolds in images. Obtains 78% recall and 79% precision.
- Design an algorithm to match detections to scaffold permits and confirm scaffold presence over multiple sightings.
- Map scaffold detections over time throughout NYC neighborhoods.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate usefulness of crowdsourced dashcam data for passive, large-scale urban sensing over time.
- Develop methods tailored for longitudinal analysis of static urban infrastructure.
- Identify scaffolding hotspots and trends across neighborhoods.
- Match 85% of active permits to model detections.
- Estimate 9.3% of detected scaffolds are unpermitted.
- Framework enables targeted inspections and innovations for city agencies.
- Brings awareness to NYC's problematic long-term scaffolding issue.

In summary, the paper shows how dashcam data enables sensing static urban elements over time, using sidewalk sheds in NYC as a case study. The methods map scaffolding prevalence across boroughs and estimate unpermitted structures to potentially assist city agencies.
