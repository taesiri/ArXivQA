# [The Minimax Rate of HSIC Estimation for Translation-Invariant Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Kernel methods like Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) are widely used for independence testing and other tasks, but the fundamental question of the minimax optimal rate for estimating HSIC is still open. 

- Existing HSIC estimators based on U/V-statistics or Nyström approximation are known to converge at rate O(n^{-1/2}), but it is unclear if this rate is minimax optimal, i.e. if there exist estimators with faster convergence rates.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors prove a minimax lower bound of Ω(n^{-1/2}) for estimating HSIC with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels on Rd. 

- They construct an adversarial pair of Gaussian distributions with a controlled KL divergence and HSIC difference to apply Le Cam's method and obtain the lower bound.

Main Contributions:
- A minimax lower bound of Ω(n^{-1/2}) is established for HSIC estimation for the general class of continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels.

- This implies minimax optimality of many widely used HSIC estimators like U/V-statistics and Nyström-based estimators.

- As a corollary, a lower bound of Ω(n^{-1/2}) on estimating the cross-covariance operator is obtained, recovering a recent result on covariance operator estimation.

- For Gaussian kernels, an explicit constant is computed in the lower bound.

In summary, the paper settles the optimality of several HSIC estimators by proving a matching minimax lower bound under mild assumptions on the kernel class. The result also implies lower bounds for related operators like the cross-covariance operator.
