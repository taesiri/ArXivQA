# [The Minimax Rate of HSIC Estimation for Translation-Invariant Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Kernel methods like Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) are widely used for independence testing and other tasks, but the fundamental question of the minimax optimal rate for estimating HSIC is still open. 

- Existing HSIC estimators based on U/V-statistics or Nyström approximation are known to converge at rate O(n^{-1/2}), but it is unclear if this rate is minimax optimal, i.e. if there exist estimators with faster convergence rates.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors prove a minimax lower bound of Ω(n^{-1/2}) for estimating HSIC with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels on Rd. 

- They construct an adversarial pair of Gaussian distributions with a controlled KL divergence and HSIC difference to apply Le Cam's method and obtain the lower bound.

Main Contributions:
- A minimax lower bound of Ω(n^{-1/2}) is established for HSIC estimation for the general class of continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels.

- This implies minimax optimality of many widely used HSIC estimators like U/V-statistics and Nyström-based estimators.

- As a corollary, a lower bound of Ω(n^{-1/2}) on estimating the cross-covariance operator is obtained, recovering a recent result on covariance operator estimation.

- For Gaussian kernels, an explicit constant is computed in the lower bound.

In summary, the paper settles the optimality of several HSIC estimators by proving a matching minimax lower bound under mild assumptions on the kernel class. The result also implies lower bounds for related operators like the cross-covariance operator.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper establishes the minimax lower bound of $O(n^{-1/2})$ for estimating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) between multivariate random variables on $\R^d$ with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels, implying the minimax optimality of several existing HSIC estimators.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It establishes a minimax lower bound of O(n^{-1/2}) for estimating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) on Rd with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels. This matches the known upper bounds of several common HSIC estimators like the U-statistic, V-statistic, and Nyström-based estimators. Thus it proves the minimax optimality of these estimators. 

2) As a corollary, it also establishes a minimax lower bound of O(n^{-1/2}) for estimating the cross-covariance operator on Rd with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels. This generalizes a previous lower bound for the estimation of the covariance operator.

So in summary, the paper proves minimax optimal rates for estimating HSIC and the cross-covariance operator on Rd, showing that some common estimators for these quantities are minimax optimal.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC)
- Kernel methods
- Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) 
- Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
- Characteristic kernels
- Translation-invariant kernels
- Minimax lower bounds
- Rate optimality
- U-statistics
- V-statistics
- Nyström approximation
- Cross-covariance operators
- Covariance operators
- Multivariate normal distributions
- Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence

The main focus of the paper is establishing minimax lower bounds for estimating HSIC and the cross-covariance operator on $\R^d$, when using continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels. It shows that rates of $O(n^{-1/2})$ are optimal for HSIC estimation. This also implies the optimality of several common HSIC estimators. Related concepts like MMD, characteristic kernels, covariance operators, etc. also play an important role.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper establishes a minimax lower bound for estimating HSIC. Can you explain intuitively why estimating HSIC is fundamentally harder (has a slower rate) than estimating the mean embedding? 

2. The proof relies on constructing an adversarial pair of Gaussian distributions. What is the intuition behind the specific choice of distributions used here? How do the means and covariances differ?

3. How does the lower bound change if we restrict the class of distributions under consideration? For example, what if we only allow sub-Gaussian distributions rather than all distributions containing the Gaussians?

4. The proof technique relies on Le Cam's method. Can you explain the key idea behind this method and why it is applicable for deriving minimax lower bounds? What are the key conditions that need to be satisfied?

5. The lower bound proof technique differs between the case of Gaussian kernels versus general translation-invariant kernels. Can you summarize the main differences in the proofs and why the Gaussian case allows making the constant explicit?

6. How does the lower bound differ in the multivariate case compared to the univariate case? Can you quantify how the constant or rate depends on the dimensionality?

7. The corollary recovers a previous lower bound on estimating the covariance operator. Intuitively, why should estimating the cross-covariance be no harder than estimating the covariance?

8. What extensions of this result seem feasible? For example, can similar lower bounds be shown for conditional HSIC or for HSIC between more than two random variables?  

9. The upper bounds of several HSIC estimators match the lower bound, implying minimax optimality. Can you name some of these estimators and explain how their rates are derived?

10. What are some open problems related to this work? For example, can the dependence of the constant on kernel parameters be made explicit for general translation-invariant kernels?
