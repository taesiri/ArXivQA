# [Data-centric Prediction Explanation via Kernelized Stein Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing example-based prediction explanation methods for neural networks often establish an influence chain between test and training data points through the model's parameters or latent representations. However, these methods have some limitations:
1) They incur significant computational overhead for large neural networks. 
2) The explanations can be coarse-grained instead of providing fine-grained, instance-level explanations.

Proposed Solution - HD-Explain:  
This paper proposes a new method called Highly-precise and Data-centric Explanation (HD-Explain) that exploits properties of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD).

Key ideas:
- KSD defines a kernel function between data points that encodes model-dependent correlation. 
- By using predicted label for test point, KSD kernel can identify training samples that provide best predictive support.
- Computationally more efficient than methods that rely on parameter or representation influence.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces HD-Explain method that produces fine-grained, instance-level explanations for neural network predictions.
2) Shows HD-Explain is more consistent, precise and efficient than influence-based methods.
3) Demonstrates HD-Explain can reveal distribution mismatches in training data for debugging.
4) Provides thorough experimental analysis across medical and benchmark datasets highlighting advantages over existing methods.

In summary, this paper presents a surprisingly simple yet effective prediction explanation method by exploiting properties of KSD. The method is highly data-centric, bypassing the need to analyze model parameters or representations. Experiments validate that HD-Explain produces precise explanations efficiently while also enabling data debugging.
