# [Abusive Span Detection for Vietnamese Narrative Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07831)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first Vietnamese dataset for detecting abusive spans in narrative texts. The dataset contains 1041 texts with 519 annotated abusive spans categorized into six types: physical, sexual, financial, cultural, verbal/emotional, and mental/psychological abuse. Experiments conducted using variants of PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa coupled with a BiLSTM layer show the complexity and challenge of the dataset. The results demonstrate that using CRF as the decoder outperforms Softmax, and PhoBERT combined with BiLSTM-CRF achieves the highest scores, with 86.00% and 58.10% F1 for relaxed evaluation on unlabeled and labeled abusive span detection tasks respectively. While there is room for improvement, especially for minority categories like sexual abuse, this benchmark dataset enables future research on an important NLP task not previously explored for Vietnamese. Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in releasing the first dataset of its kind and establishing baseline performances for abusive span detection on Vietnamese narrative texts.
