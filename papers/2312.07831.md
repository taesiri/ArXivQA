# [Abusive Span Detection for Vietnamese Narrative Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07831)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first Vietnamese dataset for detecting abusive spans in narrative texts. The dataset contains 1041 texts with 519 annotated abusive spans categorized into six types: physical, sexual, financial, cultural, verbal/emotional, and mental/psychological abuse. Experiments conducted using variants of PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa coupled with a BiLSTM layer show the complexity and challenge of the dataset. The results demonstrate that using CRF as the decoder outperforms Softmax, and PhoBERT combined with BiLSTM-CRF achieves the highest scores, with 86.00% and 58.10% F1 for relaxed evaluation on unlabeled and labeled abusive span detection tasks respectively. While there is room for improvement, especially for minority categories like sexual abuse, this benchmark dataset enables future research on an important NLP task not previously explored for Vietnamese. Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in releasing the first dataset of its kind and establishing baseline performances for abusive span detection on Vietnamese narrative texts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the creation of the first human-annotated Vietnamese dataset for detecting abusive spans in narrative texts, categorizing them into 6 types, and benchmarking baseline neural models on this new task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors created the first human-annotated dataset for Abusive spans detection in Vietnamese narrative texts. The dataset consists of 519 abusive spans in 198 abusive texts out of 1041 narrative texts. The spans are annotated with 6 categories of abuse: Physical, Sexual, Financial/Economic, Cultural/Identity, Verbal/Emotional, and Mental/Psychological.

2. The authors proposed a new task called "Abusive spans detection" which involves detecting one or more spans describing abuse directly from a Vietnamese narrative text and categorizing them into the 6 types of abuse.

3. The authors experimented with baseline models using PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa combined with BiLSTM and two decoder layers (Softmax and CRF). The results show that PhoBERT_large + BiLSTM-CRF achieved the best performance, with F-scores of 86.00% and 58.10% on the unlabeled and labeled detection tasks respectively using relaxed evaluation.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) a new human-annotated dataset for abusive span detection in Vietnamese, (2) formulation of a new task for abusive span detection and categorization, and (3) benchmarking of baseline models on the new dataset and task.

The paper presents a new human-annotated dataset for detecting spans of abusive content in Vietnamese narrative texts. It experiments with pretrained language models like PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa using a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. The tasks involve unlabeled and labeled detection of abusive spans categorized into 6 abuse types. Key results and terms revolve around the models, architectures, dataset creation, evaluation approaches, and abuse categories examined in the study.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new task called "Abusive Span Detection". Can you explain in more detail what this task involves and how it is different from existing abusive language detection tasks? 

2. The paper creates a new dataset for abusive span detection in Vietnamese narrative texts. What was the process used to collect, annotate and analyze this dataset? What were some of the key challenges?

3. The paper categorizes abusive spans into 6 different types - Physical, Sexual, Financial/Economic, Cultural/Identity, Verbal/Emotional, and Mental/Psychological. Why were these particular categories chosen? How are they defined and distinguished from one another?  

4. The paper experiments with several neural network architectures for abusive span detection. Can you walk through the different models tested, including PhoBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, BiLSTM, etc. and explain how they were combined and implemented? 

5. Two evaluation metrics were used - strict evaluation and relaxed evaluation. What is the difference between these metrics and why were both used to assess model performance?

6. The results show that using CRF as the final decoder layer performs better than a Softmax layer. Why might this be the case? How does a CRF capture dependencies between output labels?

7. Error analysis reveals confusion between some abusive span types like Sexual and Physical. What properties of the data or models might explain this difficulty in distinguishing span types?

8. How balanced was the dataset between different abusive span types? Could the imbalance explain poor performance on certain span types? How might the authors address this?

9. The relaxed evaluation metric produces much higher scores than the strict metric. What are the tradeoffs between these two evaluation approaches? Which is more meaningful?

10. The authors mention several limitations and future work possibilities. What are one or two promising research directions that could build upon this initial method and dataset?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Abuse has negative mental health impacts but there is limited research applying NLP to detect abuse, especially in Vietnamese language. 
- Most prior work focuses on hate speech detection from social media comments which are short, while long narrative texts containing abusive content are underexplored.
- There is a need for a dataset and models for detecting abusive spans in Vietnamese narrative texts across different abuse types.

Proposed Solution:
- Created first human-annotated dataset for abusive span detection in Vietnamese narrative texts with 1041 texts and 519 labeled abusive spans.
- Spans labeled for 6 abuse types: Physical, Sexual, Financial, Cultural/Identity, Verbal/Emotional, Mental/Psychological. 
- Formulated new task of unlabeled and labeled abusive span detection in texts. 
- Developed baseline models using PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa with BiLSTM and CRF/Softmax decoders.

Main Contributions:
- First Vietnamese dataset for abusive span detection in narrative texts with clear definitions and annotations.
- Introduction of new abusive span detection task with two variants.
- Benchmark experiments with strong baseline models show PhoBERT+BiLSTM-CRF performs best with 86% and 58.1% F1 scores.
- Analysis shows CRF decoder outperforms Softmax, and room for improvement for rare abuse types and nested spans.
- Resources and benchmark to motivate future research on abuse detection in Vietnamese texts.

In summary, the paper introduces a new dataset and task for detecting spans of different abuse types in Vietnamese narrative texts. Strong baseline models are presented with scope for improvement. The resources open up potential for impactful research and applications in this underexplored area.
