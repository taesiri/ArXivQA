## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing robust neural networks to solve temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) is important for applications like weather forecasting and semiconductor manufacturing. 
- Traditional methods like Finite Element Methods are computationally expensive and require manual coding for each new PDE.
- Existing learned PDE solvers are case-specific, requiring retraining for new PDEs, limiting flexibility and scope.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes OmniArch, a foundation model for building flexible machine learning models to solve PDEs.

Key Points:
- OmniArch uses a novel pre-training pipeline to process multi-physics spatio-temporal data and cast forward problem learning into scalable auto-regressive sequence modeling tasks. This provides a unified representation for diverse PDE systems.

- For fine-tuning, a new technique called Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) ensures predictions align with expert understanding of physical laws. This involves a physics-informed scorer providing rewards.

- Pre-trained on the PDEBench dataset, OmniArch sets new state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on 1D, 2D and 3D PDE tasks.

- OmniArch shows exceptional adaptability to new physics via few-shot and zero-shot learning. Its representations also facilitate solving inverse problems.

- Key features include being mesh-free, learning from dynamic observation windows instead of fixed grids/times, capturing extended temporal patterns, and improved transferability to new PDEs.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces OmniArch as a foundation model tailored for PDEs using a flexible pre-training pipeline and Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning.
- Sets new SOTA benchmarks on diverse PDE tasks while demonstrating adaptability to new physics and inverse problems.
- Establishes a paradigm for building foundation models in scientific machine learning focused on modeling physical systems described by PDEs.
