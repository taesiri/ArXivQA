# [LEGOBench: Leaderboard Generation Benchmark for Scientific Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The rapidly increasing volume of research papers makes it difficult for researchers to stay up-to-date on the state-of-the-art. 
- Comparing one's work with meaningful baselines is challenging and time-consuming.
- Existing leaderboard curation efforts are mostly manual. There is a need to automate the process of generating leaderboards that summarize the top-performing models on various datasets and tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces LEGOBench, a benchmark for evaluating automatic leaderboard generation systems. 
- The benchmark includes two datasets:
   - PwC-LDB: Leaderboards for ML tasks curated from PapersWithCode
   - APC: Diverse paper info curated from 22 years of arXiv, including titles, abstracts, full texts, citation network, comparison network
- LEGOBench formulates leaderboard generation in two ways:
   - RPG: Ranking papers based on content and graph properties 
   - RPLM: Ranking by prompting language models
- Four configurations of RPG task are presented based on different combinations of text vs network information
- Preliminary baselines are provided for both RPG and RPLM tasks 

Main Contributions:
- Curated APC and PwC-LDB datasets from arXiv and PapersWithCode
- Formulated the task of automatic leaderboard generation in two formats - RPG and RPLM
- Presented multiple configurations for RPG with varying difficulty levels
- Benchmarked several baseline methods for leaderboard generation
- Showcased gaps in performance of existing methods, motivating further research
- Discussed additional applications in citation recommendation, impact prediction, etc.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel benchmark to standardize and drive research in automatic leaderboard generation for machine learning papers. Both datasets and task formulations presented enable evaluation of different classes of models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces LEGOBench, a new benchmark for evaluating automatic leaderboard generation systems, curated from 22 years of arXiv preprint data and PapersWithCode leaderboards, formulating the task in graph-based and language model prompting formats.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The curation of two new datasets: 
- APC (arXiv Papers Collection): Comprised of titles, abstracts, full texts, citation network, and performance comparison network extracted from 1.9 million arXiv papers over the past 22 years.

2) The construction of a new benchmark called LEGOBench for evaluating automatic leaderboard generation systems. LEGOBench contains over 4,000 leaderboards with 43,000 <task, dataset, metric, algorithm> tuples mapped from the PapersWithCode repository to APC.

3) Formulation of the leaderboard generation task in two formats: 
(a) Ranking papers based on content and graph properties (RPG)
(b) Ranking by prompting language models (RPLM)

4) Preliminary baseline experiments on the RPG and RPLM tasks using graph-based ranking methods and large language models like Galactica, BARD and LLaMa. The poor performance of these initial baselines indicates significant room for improvement on the LEGOBench tasks.

5) Discussion of potential usage of the new datasets and benchmark beyond just leaderboard generation, such as for citation recommendation, impact prediction, novelty assessment etc.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of new datasets and a novel benchmark for evaluating automatic leaderboard generation systems. The formats of the benchmark tasks are designed to facilitate development of better graph-based rankers as well as retrieval of results information from scientific language models.

The paper introduces a new benchmark called LEGOBench for evaluating automatic leaderboard generation systems. It curates two datasets - the PwC dataset from PapersWithCode and the APC dataset from 22 years of arXiv papers. It formulates the leaderboard generation task in two ways - as a graph-based ranking problem using citation and performance comparison networks, and as a language model prompting task to retrieve performance scores. Preliminary results using variants of PageRank and large language models like BARD, Galactica and LLaMa are presented. The paper also discusses potential uses of the datasets and benchmark in areas like citation recommendation and impact prediction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions that could be asked about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the motivation behind the introduction of the \Bench benchmark? How does it aim to address some of the limitations of existing scientific benchmarks like SciDocs and SciRepEval?

2. What was the process used to curate the arXiv Papers Collection (APC) dataset? How did each of the stages, from arXiv paper curation to table extraction and performance comparison networks, contribute to the final APC?  

3. How does the \Bench benchmark formulate the leaderboard generation problem into the two categories of Ranking Papers based on Graph (RPG) and Ranking by Prompting Language Models (RPLM)? What are the key differences between these two formulations?

4. Discuss the different types of knowledge encoded in each of the subsets of the APC, including the citation network, performance comparison network, titles & abstracts, and full texts. How are they exploited by the different RPG task formats?  

5. What were some of the design decisions and trade-offs involved in choosing the similarity metrics used to evaluate leaderboard rankings in \Bench? Could other metrics also have been appropriate?

6. Critically analyze the presented preliminary baseline models for the RPG and RPLM tasks. What are their key limitations in terms of reasoning over knowledge encoded in APC networks and texts? 

7. The page rank based RPG model requires both a candidate retrieval and ranker module. What are some advanced ranking frameworks that could be explored? How can relevance feedback be incorporated?

8. The RPLM task hypothesizes that language models encode information about tasks, methods etc. from full texts. Do the presented results validate this hypothesis? If not, how can LMs be improved?  

9. What are the some of the most significant challenges and future opportunities in developing specialized language models for encoding scientific knowledge, as opposed to large pre-trained LMs?

10. How do approaches for automated leaderboard generation differ from traditional scientific information extraction tasks? What are the incremental innovations offered by the \Bench benchmark?
