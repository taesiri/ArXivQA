# [Weak-Mamba-UNet: Visual Mamba Makes CNN and ViT Work Better for   Scribble-based Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Medical image segmentation relies heavily on deep learning methods which require large datasets with accurate annotations. However, obtaining such dense annotations like pixel-level masks is expensive and time-consuming. To address this, research has explored weak supervision using sparse annotations like scribbles, but performance is limited.

Solution:
This paper proposes Weak-Mamba-UNet, a novel weakly-supervised learning framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the new Mamba architecture for medical image segmentation using scribble annotations. 

The key innovation is a multi-view cross-supervised learning scheme with three distinct networks - UNet, SwinUNet and MambaUNet. A collaborative pseudo-labeling approach facilitates iterative learning and refinement. Sparse scribble annotations provide partial supervision, while pseudo-labels from the networks provide dense supervision via a composite loss function. This enables mutual enhancement between the CNN, ViT and Mamba views.

Contributions:
1) First work to apply the new Mamba architecture to medical segmentation with weak scribble supervision.
2) A multi-view framework that allows CNNs, ViTs and Mambas to collaborate under limited supervision.
3) Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on an MRI cardiac dataset using sparse scribble annotations instead of expensive pixel masks.

In summary, Weak-Mamba-UNet reduces annotation costs by exploiting complementary strengths of CNNs, ViTs and Mambas within a novel cross-supervised framework tailored for sparse supervision. Key results highlight the promise of Mamba networks and multi-view learning for medical image analysis.
