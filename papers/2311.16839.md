# [Beyond Hallucinations: Enhancing LVLMs through Hallucination-Aware   Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16839)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel strategy called Hallucination-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HA-DPO) to mitigate the hallucination issue in large vision-language models (LVLMs). The key idea is to treat hallucination elimination as a preference learning problem, where the model is trained to favor non-hallucinating responses over hallucinating ones for the same image input. To enable this, the authors construct a style-consistent dataset of image-text pairs containing both hallucinating and non-hallucinating responses using GPT-4. They then directly optimize the LVLMs using this dataset to constrain their preference towards non-hallucinating outputs. Experiments on prevalent models like MiniGPT-4 and InstructBLIP show that HA-DPO leads to significant reductions in hallucinations - improving accuracy on the POPE benchmark by over 20-34% and reducing sentence-level hallucination ratio by up to 7.8%. The optimized models also demonstrate enhanced generalization capabilities on the MME benchmark. The simplicity and effectiveness of HA-DPO underscores its potential as a specialized technique to alleviate model biases after supervised pre-training.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel strategy called Hallucination-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HA-DPO) that treats hallucination elimination in large vision-language models as a preference selection issue, using style-consistent positive-negative sample pairs to train the model to favor non-hallucinating responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the HA-DPO (Hallucination-Aware Direct Preference Optimization) strategy, a novel paradigm specifically designed to counter hallucinations in large multimodal models, as well as a method for constructing style-consistent hallucination sample pairs. 

2. Introducing the SHR (Sentence-level Hallucination Ratio), an intuitive and comprehensive metric for assessing hallucinations in LVLMs.

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on prevalent models, showing a marked reduction in hallucinations and a notable enhancement in the general performance of the models after applying HA-DPO.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) the HA-DPO strategy for reducing hallucinations, (2) the SHR metric for evaluating hallucinations, and (3) experimental results proving the efficacy of their method.
