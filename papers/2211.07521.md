# [PKCAM: Previous Knowledge Channel Attention Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07521)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an effective channel attention module that captures global context and cross-channel relationships while maintaining low model complexity?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Capturing global context by aggregating features from multiple preceding layers can help the channel attention module learn more robust representations. 2) Modeling cross-channel relationships is important for capturing feature dependencies.3) Previous channel attention modules have high complexity due to fully connected layers or large kernels. A more efficient design is needed.4) Integrating global context modeling and efficient cross-channel modeling into a channel attention module can improve performance across CNN architectures while minimizing complexity.The authors propose the Previous Knowledge Channel Attention Module (PKCAM) to address these hypotheses. PKCAM aggregates features from preceding layers to capture global context, uses 1D convolutions for efficient cross-channel modeling, and combines global and local information. The central goal is improving accuracy and robustness of CNN representations with minimal overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel channel attention module called Previous Knowledge Channel Attention Module (PKCAM). The key ideas are:- PKCAM exploits both the current convolution block output as well as outputs from earlier blocks to capture global context when recalibrating channels. Most prior works only look at the current block output.- It consists of two parallel attention paths - a local path that models channel relationships of the current block, and a global path with two sub-modules: Previous Knowledge Aggregation (PKA) to aggregate features from earlier blocks, and Global Cross Channel Interaction (GCCI) to model channel relationships using the aggregated features.- The local and global paths are combined using a lightweight fusion method to produce the final recalibration weights. This allows exploiting both local and global information efficiently.- PKCAM is very lightweight and can be readily integrated into standard CNN architectures like ResNets in an end-to-end fashion.The key advantage is that by exploiting global context via previous block outputs, PKCAM is able to learn more robust channel relationships and produce better feature representations, as demonstrated through experiments on image classification, object detection, and robustness tests. The lightweight nature also allows easy integration into modern CNNs without much additional overhead.
