# [Fast Sampling via De-randomization for Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Discrete diffusion models are gaining interest for tasks like text generation due to their ability to generate high-quality discrete data. However, they suffer from slow sampling speeds compared to continuous diffusion models.

- Recent work has tried to address this through reparameterization, but still requires a large number of neural network function evaluations during sampling.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel discrete non-Markov diffusion model (DNDM) that induces a de-randomized diffusion process using latent "transition time" variables. 

- This allows them to design an accelerated, deterministic reverse sampling algorithm that focuses computations around these transition times rather than evaluating at every step.

- They further propose a continuous-time limit DNDM-C that enables infinite-step reverse sampling with only a small number of transition times.

Main Contributions:

- The proposed DNDM provably preserves important properties like marginal distributions compared to original discrete diffusion while enabling faster sampling.

- The accelerated algorithm reduces number of neural network evaluations from O(T) to O(1) as T → ∞ steps, speeding up sampling by 3-60x.

- DNDM-C allows flexible continuous reverse sampling and achieves even better sample quality than large T in experiments.

- Extensive experiments on text generation/translation tasks demonstrate superiority over prior discrete diffusion sampling methods in both speed and quality.

In summary, the paper introduces novel techniques to accelerate sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling faster and higher-quality discrete data generation while preserving desired properties.
