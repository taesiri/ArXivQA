# [Deep Active Learning for Data Mining from Conflict Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Event data on armed conflict is limited in scope, only capturing basic information like time, location, intensities etc. due to the large effort of manual data collection. More detailed data on conflict dynamics like tactics, targeting, territorial control is lacking.
- Some datasets have been created through extensive manual coding to capture specific conflict dynamics like electoral violence or attacks on religious targets. But these are resource intensive, limited in scope, not updated regularly.
- Automated coding methods like TABARI have limitations in inclusiveness and semantic understanding needed for such tasks. Traditional machine learning requires large labeled datasets.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage recent advances in language models (LLMs) like BERT and active learning to extract richer event data from existing conflict corpora with minimal human effort.
- Use unsupervised keyword search to create a more balanced subset of the full corpus as seed set.
- Iterate through batches where the human annotates articles selected by the model as most uncertain, retraining the LLM classifier after each round.
- Evaluate on existing datasets for religious violence and electoral violence.

Key Contributions:
- Shows LLMs fine-tuned with active learning can match gold standard human annotation in classifying niche conflict events, while reducing annotation effort by 99%.
- Convergence typically occurs within 5-7 rounds of annotation batches. Performance similar across batch sizes of 50-200 articles.
- Suggests domain-specific LLM like ConfliBERT outperforms smaller general LLMs by 2-10% in this domain.
- Proposes a practical human-in-the-loop system adaptable to different conflict event extraction tasks.
- Opens ability for individual researchers to extract richer event data at scale from existing corpora.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an efficient method to create detailed conflict event datasets by combining modern NLP models with an iterative human-guided approach, greatly reducing the resources required compared to fully manual annotation.
