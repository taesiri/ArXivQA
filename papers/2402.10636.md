# [PEGASUS: Personalized Generative 3D Avatars with Composable Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10636)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper aims to build personalized 3D face avatars from monocular videos that allow control over facial attributes like hairstyles, accessories, facial features etc. while preserving identity. Previous methods focus on reconstructing the exact replica of the person from videos. However, users may want to modify their avatars by altering subparts. Existing generative face models operate in 2D space, lacking animatability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a method called PEGASUS to create personalized generative 3D face avatars from monocular videos. It employs a compositional generative model with disentangled controls over facial attributes. Two key approaches are presented:

1) Construct person-specific avatar by synthesizing a collection of videos showing the identity with varying attributes. This is done by part replacement from other source videos. The synthesized identity videos are used to train a generative avatar model with selective control.

2) Achieve similar avatar construction more efficiently via zero-shot part transfer from a pre-built generative avatar model of another person. The model combines the controlled part from source model and remaining target identity part.

Main Contributions:

1) First method to create personalized generative 3D avatars with disentangled control over facial attributes from monocular videos 

2) Part-swapping based synthesis of identity videos showing attribute variations

3) Zero-shot transfer approach to efficiently build personalized avatar by combining source and target models

The experiments demonstrate selective facial attribute control, superior identity preservation compared to alternatives, and high visual quality. The avatars are animatable using model parameters.
