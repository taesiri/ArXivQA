# [APAR: LLMs Can Do Auto-Parallel Auto-Regressive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06761)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently is challenging due to their auto-regressive (AR) decoding process which is incremental and accessing the full model for each token generation results in low latency and throughput. 

- The AR attention mechanism over all preceding tokens also limits serving throughput, especially for long sequences, as attention computation and key-value (KV) cache scale with sequence length.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce auto-parallel auto-regressive (APAR) decoding to enhance parallelism and efficiency. Models are fine-tuned on data with hierarchical structure to enable autonomous planning of parallel decoding threads when potential parallelizable structures are detected. 

- APAR decoding algorithm maintains the hierarchical structure during generation and restores to a linear sequence. It uses control tokens like "fork" to spawn parallel threads.

Key Benefits:
- Reduces number of generation steps, improving latency by up to 2x alone and 4x combined with speculative decoding.

- Enables early release of KV cache for completed sequences, reducing cache usage by up to 50% while maintaining throughput. 

- Limits per-token attention to ancestors only, reducing computation by 15-35%. This further improves throughput by 20-70% and reduces latency by 20-35%.

- Retains contextual generation quality with negligible quality change of ±2%.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes APAR decoding to enhance parallelism in LLM generation through autonomous planning by the model itself.

- Introduces decoding algorithm to maintain and restore hierarchical structures for parallel decoding threads. 

- Demonstrates improved serving efficiency across metrics like latency, throughput and memory while retaining generation quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces APAR, a novel auto-regressive decoding method that enables large language models to autonomously detect and leverage parallelizable structure in text to generate responses more efficiently, with negligible impact on quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing APAR (Auto-Parallel Auto-Regressive), a novel decoding method that allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously structure the decoding process and dynamically create parallel decoding threads. Key highlights:

- APAR leverages the inherent parallelizable structure in LLM generation, enabling models to automatically detect parts that can be generated in parallel after being fine-tuned on data with hierarchical structure. This transforms the typical linear AR generation into a parallelizable tree structure.

- APAR significantly reduces the number of decoding steps, achieving up to 2x speedup alone. When combined with speculative decoding methods like Medusa, the speedup reaches 4x. 

- APAR reduces key-value cache consumption and attention computation. In high-throughput scenarios, it increases throughput by 20-70% and reduces latency by 20-35% compared to state-of-the-art serving frameworks.

- The quality of APAR model responses remains largely unchanged (±2%) compared to the original AR models, indicating it retains strong contextual generation capabilities.

In summary, APAR enables more efficient serving of LLMs without compromising quality by exploiting their intrinsic ability to understand text structure and transform the decoding process to be more parallel.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Auto-parallel auto-regressive (APAR) decoding: The main technique introduced in the paper to enable parallel decoding threads in language model generation.

- Instruct-tuning: Fine-tuning the language models on data with hierarchical/tree structures to teach them to detect parallelizable structures and spawn parallel decoding threads. 

- Paragraph trees: Hierarchical structure representing a sequence with components that can be generated in parallel. Used to train models for APAR decoding.

- Control tokens: Special tokens added to model vocabulary - \texttt{[Fork]} and \texttt{[Child]} - to indicate parsing of parallel structures.

- Latency reduction: APAR can reduce inference latency and increase decoding speed by enabling more parallelism.

- Throughput improvement: APAR reduces compute and memory needs, allowing improvements in throughput for high-concurrency scenarios.

- Speculative decoding: APAR can combine with speculative decoding methods like Medusa for further speedups.

- Serving efficiency: Overall, APAR improves efficiency of deploying and serving large language models through faster decoding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the training process for APAR models differ from traditional autoregressive language model training? What modifications need to be made to the data and attention mechanisms?

2) The decoding algorithm seems critical for enabling the parallel autoregressive generation. Can you walk through the key steps in more detail and highlight the logic behind critical operations like forking new sequences? 

3) What are some key challenges you foresee in applying APAR to much larger language models? Would modifications need to be made to model architecture or just the decoding algorithm?

4) How does APAR compare to other parallel decoding methods like speculative decoding or non-autoregressive decoding? What are the tradeoffs between these approaches?

5) Could the ideas behind APAR be applied to other autoregressive generation tasks like image synthesis or audio generation? What changes would need to be made?

6) You mention combining APAR with methods like Medusa and vLLM. Can you expand more on how these integrations work? Do you expect further synergies by combining APAR with other inference acceleration techniques?

7) What types of model architectures and datasets do you think would be best suited for achieving strong APAR performance? Are there cases where APAR may not be effective?

8) The control tokens seem essential for guiding the parallel generation threads. Can you discuss strategies for stabilizing and improving how models learn to use these tokens?

9) How might APAR change the optimization function for companies deploying large language models? What new tradeoffs emerge between latency, throughput, etc?

10) You demonstrate strong results on Vicuna models. To what extent are these findings likely to translate to much larger models with over 100 billion parameters? Would entirely new techniques be needed?
