# [Large Language Models for Compiler Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

Can large language models learn to optimize code, specifically by emulating complex compiler optimizations and predicting good optimization strategies for unseen programs?

The authors hypothesize that large language models, when trained on enough examples of code optimizations, can learn to effectively optimize new programs without needing to invoke the compiler multiple times like prior machine learning approaches. 

The paper introduces the novel application of large language models to code optimization, and aims to evaluate their ability to reason about code transformations and match the performance of traditional compilers and search-based optimization techniques. The key ideas explored are:

- Training a large transformer model from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly code for size by predicting good sequences of optimization passes.

- Using the unoptimized code as input and generating pass lists, instruction counts, and optimized code as outputs during training. This is hypothesized to teach the model to deeply understand code optimization. 

- Evaluating model-generated pass lists against standard compiler optimization levels and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques on a large benchmark suite.

- Analyzing the model's code generation capabilities by examining cases where its optimized code does not match the compiler's output.

- Additional ablation experiments training models on different tasks and data sizes to determine contributions.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that large language models can effectively learn complex compiler optimizations when trained on enough examples, despite lacking the hard-coded rules and algorithms present in real compilers. The paper aims to demonstrate and characterize this potential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the novel application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to code optimization. Specifically:

- The authors train a 7B-parameter transformer model from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly code for size. The model takes unoptimized LLVM IR as input and outputs a list of compiler optimization passes to apply.

- During training, the model is asked to predict instruction counts before and after optimization, as well as the optimized code itself. The authors show these auxiliary prediction tasks significantly improve the model's optimization performance.

- The model achieves a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction count over the LLVM compiler's default optimizations, outperforming prior ML approaches. It shows strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the compiler 70% of the time.

- This is the first demonstration of using the raw representation power of LLMs for compiler optimization tasks. Prior ML approaches relied on manually engineered input features or graphs, losing fidelity. The textual interface here is complete, portable, and accessible.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that Large Language Models can learn to optimize code when trained directly on compiler IR, despite the complex reasoning required. The results demonstrate LLMs' potential for program analysis and transformation tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores using Large Language Models for code optimization by training a 7 billion parameter transformer to take LLVM assembly code as input and output optimized compiler options, achieving better code size reduction than the baseline compiler and prior ML approaches without needing multiple compilations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research in applying machine learning to compiler optimization:

- This is the first work to apply large language models (LLMs) to the task of compiler optimization and pass ordering. Prior works have used ML techniques like reinforcement learning or graph neural networks, but no one has explored the capabilities of LLMs for this task before.

- The paper targets optimizing LLVM intermediate representation (IR) directly, rather than source code. Some prior works operate on source languages like Python, while others use IR but in a limited fashion (e.g. excluding constants). Optimizing the full fidelity IR is novel.

- The approach of using text as the input/output for the model is new. Other techniques rely on specialized input representations like static feature vectors or program graphs. Text has the advantages of being universal, complete, and accessible.

- For training data, the authors use an autotuner with random search to find optimal pass sequences. This provides a stronger training signal than prior works which often just compare to the built-in compiler ordering.

- The auxiliary prediction tasks of predicting instruction counts and generating optimized code are unique. These provide self-supervision and force the model to deeply understand optimizations.

- The results significantly outperform prior learned approaches for pass ordering, achieving 60% of the gains of exhaustive autotuning with zero additional compilations. Other techniques require thousands of compilations.

- Analysis of model-generated code shows capabilities not demonstrated before, like correctly applying complex optimizations 70% of the time with no access to compiler internals.

Overall, this paper pushes machine learning for compilers to the next level by being the first to tap into the reasoning potential of large language models. The approach, analysis of model internals, and benchmarking against other state-of-the-art techniques make this a significant contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Increasing the context window size that the model can handle. Currently they are limited to sequences of 2048 tokens, which restricts them to optimizing individual functions rather than whole programs. They suggest incorporating techniques like length extrapolation to handle longer sequences.

- Improving the model's mathematical reasoning abilities. They found the model struggled with constant folding and dataflow analysis that requires arithmetic computation. They suggest a curriculum focused on arithmetic and logic, as well as using tools to help the model compute intermediate results. 

- Speeding up inference time. Currently it takes much longer for the model to generate a pass list than for the compiler to execute it. They suggest aggressive batching, quantization, and vocabulary specialization to reduce the number of tokens needed.

- Adding support for determining semantic equivalence of code variants. Currently it is difficult to evaluate when model-generated code is semantically equivalent to the reference. They suggest incorporating techniques like differential testing.

- Exploring a chain-of-thought approach where models are taught to break down complex optimizations into smaller incremental steps. As a first step they trained models on individual optimization passes.

- Focusing training on the most complex and difficult optimization passes using techniques like active learning.

Overall, the authors are excited about the potential for large language models to learn compiler optimizations, but recognize there are still challenges around scaling, reasoning abilities, speed, and correctness that need to be addressed by future work. Their results suggest a promising path forward for machine learning in compilers.
