# [Vesicoureteral Reflux Detection with Reliable Probabilistic Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a pediatric disorder where urine flows back from the bladder to the kidneys, increasing risk of urinary tract infections and kidney damage. 
- Current method of VUR detection (voiding cystourethrogram - VCUG) is painful and exposes child to radiation. 
- Goal is to detect VUR without radiation using machine learning on clinical/lab data. Prior machine learning methods give only yes/no diagnosis without indication of reliability. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use a machine learning framework called Venn Prediction (VP) which provides a multiprobability prediction - a set of probability distributions summarized as lower/upper bounds for probability that child has VUR.
- Bounds are guaranteed, under general iid assumption, to contain well-calibrated probabilities (reliable).  
- Apply VP with artificial neural networks (ANN-VP), using minority oversampling and majority undersampling to address class imbalance.

Contributions:
- Proposed ANN-VP provides reliable probabilistic bounds for VUR detection from non-radiation data.
- ANN-VP outperforms conventional ANN, especially on reliability metric - shows conventional ANN probabilities can be misleading.  
- Minority oversampling gives better performance than majority undersampling.
- Demonstrated bounds remain well-calibrated under different conditions in online setting, unlike ANN probabilities.
- Approach suitable for clinical practice - supports decisions without risk of misleading probabilities.

In summary, the key innovation is the application of Venn Prediction to provide an ANN classifier with reliable probability bounds for detecting VUR without radiation exposure. Experiments validate improved reliability over standard ANN probabilities.
