# [Updating Language Models with Unstructured Facts: Towards Practical   Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current knowledge editing methods are evaluated solely on structured facts (subject-relation-object triplets), which are laborious to obtain. However, real-world knowledge updates commonly emerge in unstructured texts like news articles. This misalignment limits the practical applicability of knowledge editing.  

Proposed Solution - Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE):
The paper proposes a more practical benchmark, UKE, that directly evaluates editing performance using unstructured texts as knowledge updates (unstructured facts). This avoids manual construction of structured facts and enables efficient, responsive editing.

Main Contributions:
1) Defines the novel UKE benchmark that uses unstructured facts for editing and evaluation. This aligns better with real-world knowledge update sources.

2) Constructs new datasets for UKE with both counterfactual and real-world updates from Wikidata and Wikipedia.

3) Shows via experiments that current editing methods struggle on UKE despite leveraging automatically extracted structured facts. State-of-the-art in-context learning methods perform relatively better but still substantially underperform on structured facts.

4) Identifies key challenges like implicitness and complexity of unstructured facts that make UKE difficult. The findings highlight the need to advance knowledge editing methods to handle unstructured facts for practical applicability.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates a more practical UKE benchmark for knowledge editing aligned with real-world update sources. Experiments expose deficiencies of current methods, motivating further research towards editable language models that can ingest unstructured update texts.
