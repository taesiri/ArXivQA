# [Updating Language Models with Unstructured Facts: Towards Practical   Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current knowledge editing methods are evaluated solely on structured facts (subject-relation-object triplets), which are laborious to obtain. However, real-world knowledge updates commonly emerge in unstructured texts like news articles. This misalignment limits the practical applicability of knowledge editing.  

Proposed Solution - Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE):
The paper proposes a more practical benchmark, UKE, that directly evaluates editing performance using unstructured texts as knowledge updates (unstructured facts). This avoids manual construction of structured facts and enables efficient, responsive editing.

Main Contributions:
1) Defines the novel UKE benchmark that uses unstructured facts for editing and evaluation. This aligns better with real-world knowledge update sources.

2) Constructs new datasets for UKE with both counterfactual and real-world updates from Wikidata and Wikipedia.

3) Shows via experiments that current editing methods struggle on UKE despite leveraging automatically extracted structured facts. State-of-the-art in-context learning methods perform relatively better but still substantially underperform on structured facts.

4) Identifies key challenges like implicitness and complexity of unstructured facts that make UKE difficult. The findings highlight the need to advance knowledge editing methods to handle unstructured facts for practical applicability.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates a more practical UKE benchmark for knowledge editing aligned with real-world update sources. Experiments expose deficiencies of current methods, motivating further research towards editable language models that can ingest unstructured update texts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a more practical benchmark, Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE), for evaluating knowledge editing methods by using unstructured texts as facts rather than structured facts, and shows that current methods struggle on this benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the benchmark of Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) for evaluating knowledge editing methods. Specifically, UKE edits language models directly using unstructured texts as knowledge updates (unstructured facts) rather than well-curated structured facts. This aligns more closely with real-world scenarios where knowledge updates commonly emerge from unstructured texts. The paper then conducts experiments showing that UKE poses significant challenges to current state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods, motivating further research into more practical and efficient knowledge editing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) - The proposed new benchmark that evaluates knowledge editing performance using unstructured texts as facts rather than structured facts.

- Unstructured facts - Unstructured texts like news articles and Wikipedia pages that convey real-world knowledge updates, used as facts for editing in UKE.

- Structured facts - Well-curated fact triplets with subjects, relations, and objects, used as facts in current knowledge editing evaluations.  

- Knowledge editing - The task of injecting knowledge updates into language models to keep them correct and up-to-date.

- Fine-tuning - Directly fine-tuning language model parameters as a knowledge editing strategy. 

- Locate-then-edit - Locating related model parameters first and then editing them to inject knowledge updates.

- In-context learning - Using new facts to adjust answers without modifying model parameters, converting editing to QA.

- Counterfactual updates - Fake or non-existing updates used to construct datasets like CounterFacts and MQuAKE-CF.

- Real-world updates - Genuine factual updates extracted from Wikidata, used in the proposed WikiUpdate dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the key motivations behind proposing the Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) benchmark? Why does it better align with practical applications compared to existing knowledge editing evaluations?

2. The paper argues that extracting structured facts from unstructured texts can be inefficient and introduce noise/bias. What evidence supports this argument? How could the triplet extraction process be improved? 

3. The UKE benchmark appears to pose significant challenges for current state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods like IKE and MeLLo. What specifically makes it more difficult for these methods to handle unstructured facts?

4. For the in-context learning methods, what factors lead to declines in both their retrieval and reasoning performances when evaluated on the UKE benchmark, especially for real-world updates in the WikiUpdate dataset?

5. What modifications could be made to current knowledge editing methods like IKE and MeLLo to make them perform better on the UKE benchmark while retaining efficiency?

6. How suitable are the unstructured facts generated by LLMs for evaluating the UKE benchmark? What are the tradeoffs versus using real unstructured texts?

7. What additional datasets could be constructed to further improve the practical applicability of the UKE benchmark? What other sources beyond Wikipedia could provide useful unstructured facts?

8. Beyond accuracy, what other metrics could evaluate the performance of knowledge editing methods on unstructured facts, such as robustness to paraphrasing?

9. The authors suggest future work could concentrate on in-context learning methods. What specific improvements to the retrieval and reasoning processes could enable better UKE performance?

10. What role does the choice of base language model play in knowledge editing performance on UKE? How does UKE performance vary when using models like GPT-3 vs BLOOM vs LLaMA?
