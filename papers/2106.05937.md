# [Fair Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:How can we learn fair data representations that provably guarantee sensitive attributes cannot be recovered, while maintaining high utility for downstream prediction tasks?The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:- Proposing Fair Normalizing Flows (FNF), which uses normalizing flow models as encoders. This allows exact likelihood computation in the latent space.- Leveraging the exact likelihoods to minimize the statistical distance between latent representations of different sensitive groups. This provides an upper bound on the maximum unfairness of any downstream predictor.- Theoretical analysis showing how density estimation can be used to obtain guarantees even when the true densities are unknown.- Experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrating FNF can substantially increase fairness guarantees without significantly sacrificing accuracy.So in summary, the main research contribution is proposing a novel fair representation learning approach called Fair Normalizing Flows, which uniquely provides rigorous theoretical guarantees on the fairness of learned representations, while maintaining high utility. The theoretical analysis and experimental results support this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new method called Fair Normalizing Flows (FNF) for learning fair data representations with strong theoretical guarantees on the fairness of the representations. Specifically:- FNF models the encoder as a normalizing flow, which allows computing the exact data likelihood in the latent representation space. This enables evaluating the maximum adversarial accuracy for predicting sensitive attributes from the latent representations.- FNF trains the normalizing flow encoders to minimize the statistical distance between the latent representations of different sensitive groups. This allows providing guarantees on various group fairness criteria like demographic parity and equalized odds. - Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FNF can provably remove sensitive attributes from the learned representations while maintaining high utility for downstream prediction tasks.In summary, the key novelty is using normalizing flows for fair representation learning in order to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the fairness of learned representations, which prior adversarial methods cannot provide. The experimental results validate that FNF can enforce various fairness criteria with minimal accuracy loss on challenging datasets.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a new method called Fair Normalizing Flows (FNF) for learning fair data representations. Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work:- Most prior work on fair representation learning relies on adversarial training to remove sensitive attributes. However, recent papers have shown that adversarially learned representations can still allow recovery of sensitive attributes by stronger adversaries not considered during training. In contrast, FNF provides provable guarantees that sensitive attributes cannot be recovered, for any adversary.- Some recent papers (Feng et al., Moyer et al.) also aim to provide guarantees on adversary accuracy, but rely on bounds that are either loose or only hold for restricted classes of adversaries like Lipschitz functions. FNF provides tighter guarantees by leveraging the exact likelihood computation enabled by normalizing flows.- Normalizing flows have not been explored much for fair representation learning before. The only related work is a concurrent paper by Cerrato et al. which also uses flows, but does not provide the theoretical fairness guarantees of FNF.- Most prior interpretable fair representation methods require a separate reconstruction loss term. FNF avoids this due to the bijectivity of the normalizing flow encoders. This enables direct interpretability and recourse methods.- For categorical data, FNF provides an optimal bijective encoding based on probability sorting, unlike other methods which rely on neural networks even for discrete data.In summary, this paper introduces a novel approach to fair representation learning using normalizing flows. It provides stronger theoretical fairness guarantees compared to prior adversarial methods. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in removing sensitive attributes across several datasets. The invertibility of the encoders also enables interpretability analysis and recourse methods not possible with other representations.
