# [Masked Images Are Counterfactual Samples for Robust Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03052)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve the robustness of fine-tuned vision models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data while maintaining good performance on in-distribution data?

The key hypothesis is that using masked images as counterfactual training samples can help preserve the OOD robustness of large pre-trained vision models when fine-tuning them on downstream tasks. 

In particular, the paper proposes:

- Masking semantics-related or unrelated image regions based on class activation maps to break spurious correlations in the training data.

- Refilling the masked regions with patches from other images to further distort the original semantics.

- Using the resulting masked counterfactual images for feature-based distillation with the pre-trained model during fine-tuning.

The central hypothesis is that training the fine-tuned model to mimic the pre-trained model on these counterfactual samples will help retain robustness to OOD data while improving in-distribution performance. Experiments on ImageNet fine-tuning validate this hypothesis and show improved OOD accuracy over prior methods.

In summary, the key research question is how to improve robustness to OOD data in fine-tuning vision models, and the central hypothesis is using counterfactual masked images can achieve this goal. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel fine-tuning method to improve the robustness of vision models using masked images as counterfactual samples. Specifically:

- The paper analyzes the issue of robustness degradation in fine-tuning from a causal perspective. It models the image generation process with a structural causal model and finds that fine-tuning tends to learn spurious correlations between semantic and non-semantic factors, which harms robustness. 

- To address this issue, the paper proposes to construct counterfactual images by masking and refilling patches based on class activation maps. These images help break the spurious correlations and regularize fine-tuning.

- The paper investigates different strategies for masking (random, object-focused, context-focused) and refilling (no refill, single image, multiple images). Experiments show masking object-focused regions and refilling from a single image works best.

- The proposed fine-tuning method is shown to achieve better robustness, measured by accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, than previous methods like WiSE-FT and Model Soup, while maintaining competitive in-distribution accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel fine-tuning approach that leverages masked images as counterfactual samples to improve model robustness, guided by a causal analysis of the robustness degradation problem. The effectiveness is validated by comprehensive experiments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using masked images as counterfactual samples during fine-tuning to improve robustness to distribution shifts, by breaking spurious correlations between semantic and non-semantic factors in the data and preserving generalizable knowledge from the pre-trained model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on improving out-of-distribution robustness in fine-tuning vision models:

- This paper takes a novel causal perspective on analyzing the issue of robustness degradation in fine-tuning. Previous works like LP-FT, WiSE-FT, and Model Soup have focused more on constraining model deviation from the pre-trained weights during fine-tuning. The causal analysis provides new insights into the problem.

- The idea of using masked images as counterfactual samples during fine-tuning is innovative. Other recent works using masked images like MAE and MaskFeat focused on self-supervised pre-training rather than transfer learning. The proposed strategies for generating masked images tailored for improving robustness are not explored before.

- The experiments demonstrate superior OOD robustness over previous state-of-the-art methods like WiSE-FT and Model Soup on benchmark datasets, without relying on model ensembles or complex training procedures. This validates the efficacy of the proposed approach.

- However, the improvements on certain OOD datasets are smaller compared to WiSE-FT. As analyzed in the paper, the two methods may improve different aspects of robustness. Integrating WiSE-FT into the proposed approach leads to only minor further improvements.

- The causal perspective of modeling the image generation process is interesting but remains conceptual. More rigorous causal modeling and learning algorithms conforming to the proposed perspective could be promising future directions.

In summary, this paper presents a novel causal view and counterfactual learning approach for improving OOD robustness in fine-tuning, complementing other directions like weight constraint methods. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed masked image training, while potential limitations are analyzed to motivate future works. More rigorous causal modeling and learning algorithms may better unlock the potential of this perspective.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the refilling strategies for constructing more effective counterfactual samples. As mentioned in the Conclusion, the current refilling strategies are unaware of the content being filled in, which limits the usefulness of the resulting counterfactual images. The authors suggest exploring refilling methods that better conform to the causal modeling framework.

- Developing better distillation methods to better regularize the learning of the classification head during fine-tuning. The current feature-based distillation may be insufficient. Alternative distillation techniques could be explored.

- Generalizing the approach to other pre-trained models and tasks beyond CLIP and ImageNet classification. The authors demonstrate the efficacy on CLIP fine-tuning for ImageNet, but the approach could be tested more broadly.

- Further theoretical analysis to better understand why the proposed fine-tuning approach differs substantially from vanilla fine-tuning and WiSE-FT ensembles. The results suggest the method leads to very different fine-tuned models, and more analysis could provide insight.

- Exploring combinations with other robust fine-tuning techniques like WiSE-FT. The current integration was limited, but further exploration could lead to complimentary benefits.

- Validating the causal assumptions made about the image generation process and non-stationary vs. stationary factors. Further empirical analysis or experiments could help validate the causal modeling.

In summary, the main directions are improving the counterfactual sample generation, complementing the distillation, generalizing the approach, further theoretical analysis, integration with other methods, and validation of the causal modeling assumptions. The authors provide a solid starting point and outline promising avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new fine-tuning method to improve the robustness of large pre-trained vision models like CLIP to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, while maintaining good performance on in-distribution data. The key idea is to use masked images as counterfactual training samples to break spurious correlations learned during fine-tuning. In particular, the paper masks semantics-related or unrelated image regions based on class activation maps, and refills the masked patches with those from other images. These counterfactual images are then used to supervise the fine-tuning model via feature distillation with the pre-trained model, which helps preserve the pre-trained model's knowledge for OOD robustness. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods like LP-FT, WiSE-FT and Model Soup in terms of OOD accuracy on datasets like ImageNet-V2 and ObjectNet. The results suggest that learning from pre-defined counterfactual examples is an effective approach to improve robustness against distribution shifts.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method to improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of fine-tuned models while maintaining good in-distribution (ID) performance. The key idea is to use masked images as counterfactual samples during fine-tuning to break spurious correlations between semantic and non-semantic features. Specifically, the authors generate masked images by either removing image regions that are most semantically relevant (usually the main object) or least semantically relevant (usually the context/background), using class activation maps. The removed regions are then refilled with patches from other images. These masked images serve as counterfactual samples that cause contradictions between predictions of the robust pre-trained model and the fine-tuning model. By distilling the pre-trained model's features on the masked images, the fine-tuning model learns to rely less on non-semantic cues for prediction. Experiments show that fine-tuning with the proposed masked images improves OOD robustness over vanilla fine-tuning and other methods on CLIP models, while maintaining competitive ID accuracy. The gains are particularly significant on datasets with different backgrounds or viewpoints than the ID data. Overall, this work provides a novel perspective and method based on causal modeling and counterfactual samples to address the ID-OOD trade-off in fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) analyzing the OOD robustness problem in fine-tuning from a causal perspective; 2) proposing masked images as counterfactual samples to break spurious correlations; 3) demonstrating improved OOD robustness with competitive ID accuracy compared to prior art. The core idea is to construct and leverage counterfactual samples that expose contradictions between the pre-trained and fine-tuning models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method that uses masked images as counterfactual samples to improve the robustness of vision models. Based on a causal analysis, the authors find that fine-tuning can lead models to rely on spurious correlations between semantic and non-semantic factors, which harms out-of-distribution robustness. To address this, they generate counterfactual images by masking patches that are either semantically relevant or irrelevant, identified using class activation maps. The masked regions are refilled with patches from other images. These counterfactual images are then used alongside original images to fine-tune the model, by having it mimic the features of a robust pre-trained model on the masked images through distillation. This forces the fine-tuned model to rely less on spurious correlations for prediction. Experiments show that fine-tuning with such masked images improves robustness to distribution shifts compared to prior methods.
