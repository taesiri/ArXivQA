# [ExpNet: A unified network for Expert-Level Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on a challenging vision classification task called "expert-level classification". This refers to tasks that require recognizing professional/expert categories from images, such as identifying bird species, medical diagnoses from scans, recognizing artwork styles/cultures. These tasks face both label complexity (expert labels) and task complexity (wide variety). Prior methods like fine-grained classification only handle specific sub-tasks well but don't generalize. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a unified network called ExpNet to address expert-level classification. The key idea is to hierarchically decompose an image into focal (discriminative parts) and context features, and process them individually at each stage. This is done through a proposed Gaze-Shift module, which uses a Neural Firing Fields unit (NeFiRF) to split features into focal/context. The focal features are spatially organized and sent to next stage. The context features are modeled via cross-attention to get a "Context Impression" embedding. After several Gaze-Shift stages, the final focal embedding fuses with all context impressions to make the final prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and formulate the expert-level classification problem which requires recognizing professional image categories.
- Propose a unified ExpNet framework to individually process focal and context features hierarchically, enabling focus on details while retaining context.  
- Design a Gaze-Shift module with NeFiRF unit to split and process focal vs context features differently.
- Achieve state-of-the-art results on fine-grained classification, medical diagnosis and artwork recognition tasks, outperforming specialized approaches.
- Show additional benefits like weakly supervised localization, indicating ExpNet learns to focus on salient regions.
