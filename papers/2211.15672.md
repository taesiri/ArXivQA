# [ExpNet: A unified network for Expert-Level Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on a challenging vision classification task called "expert-level classification". This refers to tasks that require recognizing professional/expert categories from images, such as identifying bird species, medical diagnoses from scans, recognizing artwork styles/cultures. These tasks face both label complexity (expert labels) and task complexity (wide variety). Prior methods like fine-grained classification only handle specific sub-tasks well but don't generalize. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a unified network called ExpNet to address expert-level classification. The key idea is to hierarchically decompose an image into focal (discriminative parts) and context features, and process them individually at each stage. This is done through a proposed Gaze-Shift module, which uses a Neural Firing Fields unit (NeFiRF) to split features into focal/context. The focal features are spatially organized and sent to next stage. The context features are modeled via cross-attention to get a "Context Impression" embedding. After several Gaze-Shift stages, the final focal embedding fuses with all context impressions to make the final prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and formulate the expert-level classification problem which requires recognizing professional image categories.
- Propose a unified ExpNet framework to individually process focal and context features hierarchically, enabling focus on details while retaining context.  
- Design a Gaze-Shift module with NeFiRF unit to split and process focal vs context features differently.
- Achieve state-of-the-art results on fine-grained classification, medical diagnosis and artwork recognition tasks, outperforming specialized approaches.
- Show additional benefits like weakly supervised localization, indicating ExpNet learns to focus on salient regions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes ExpNet, a unified network that hierarchically decouples part and context features to address the challenges of expert-level classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Verifying that expert-level classification, a challenging vision classification task requiring professional categories, can be solved by a unified deep learning framework. 

2) Proposing ExpNet with Gaze-Shift to individually process the focal and context features by different parameters and architectures in a hierarchical manner. This helps to overcome the unique challenges of expert-level classification.

3) Proposing NeFiRF in Gaze-Shift to group the features in the frequency space with spatial constraints. 

4) Achieving state-of-the-art results on three representative expert-level classification tasks compared to both task-specific and general classification methods.

5) Achieving competitive performance on weakly-supervised segmentation and localization tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a unified network called ExpNet to address the unique challenges of expert-level classification, which requires recognizing professional and complex categories. ExpNet achieves this by hierarchically modeling part and context features as well as their interactions.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Expert-level classification - The paper focuses on a challenging type of visual classification that requires recognizing professional/expert categories in images, beyond general image classification.

- Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) - A related research area that aims to distinguish subordinate categories within entry-level categories, a subset of expert-level classification tasks.

- Part-context modeling - The paper proposes hierarchically decoupling part and context features in images and individually processing them, enabling a focus on discriminative parts while retaining context.

- Gaze-Shift - A proposed module to produce a focal-part feature map and context impression embedding at each stage by separating features into "focus" and "context". 

- Neural Firing Fields (NeFiRF) - A proposed method to generate a saliency map to split feature map patches into focal and context, introducing spatial constraints.

- Hierarchical feature interaction - The approach allows integrating features from different stages to enable comprehensive classification predictions.

- Weakly-supervised localization/segmentation - As an additional capability, the intermediate saliency maps have a relationship to object shape/location, enabling weak localization/segmentation.
