# [Two Online Map Matching Algorithms Based on Analytic Hierarchy Process   and Fuzzy Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11866)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Map matching is the process of matching a GPS trajectory to the correct route on a road network map. It is challenging to handle GPS errors and make correct route choices, especially at junctions and parallel roads.

- The paper aims to develop innovative map matching algorithms with greater accuracy, applicability to real-world problems, and ease of implementation. The focus is on online (live) map matching.

Proposed Solutions
- Two new map matching algorithms are proposed: 
   1) Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) map matching 
   2) Fuzzy logic map matching

- AHP map matching combines mathematical analysis with human judgement to make routing decisions based on factors like distance, direction, and turn restrictions. Weights are assigned to candidate route segments at junctions using AHP.

- Fuzzy logic map matching handles imprecision in data by modeling possibilities from 0 to 1 rather than binary logic. It uses fuzzy inference rules to score route candidates.

- Both methods have an initial map matching step to find the first correct route segment, then subsequent steps to verify if points match the current segment or pick a new one at junctions.

Contributions
- The AHP approach to map matching is new and has not been explored before based on literature review.

- The fuzzy logic algorithm implementation has minor changes from prior works, mainly adding confidence weights to inference rules.

- The algorithms are designed to be simple and easy to implement, while still giving adequate accuracy. Performance is comparable to an existing algorithm.

- Analysis using real-world open data validates the feasibility of the proposed ideas. Scope for improvements is also identified.

In summary, the key highlights are the novel AHP algorithm, modified fuzzy logic algorithm, demonstration of simplicity and adequacy, and experimental validation, along with future work directions.
