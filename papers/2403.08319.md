# [Knowledge Conflicts for LLMs: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Knowledge Conflicts for LLMs: A Survey":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) utilize both parametric knowledge encoded in their parameters from pre-training, as well as contextual knowledge from external sources like user prompts and retrieved documents. This gives rise to three types of knowledge conflicts when the different knowledge sources contradict each other:

1) Context-Memory Conflict: When the contextual knowledge conflicts with the LLM's parametric knowledge. Caused by temporal misalignment of the LLM's outdated knowledge or exposure to misinformation.

2) Inter-Context Conflict: When there are inconsistencies between different external contextual sources, like due to the presence of misinformation or outdated facts in retrieved documents. 

3) Intra-Memory Conflict: When an LLM generates inconsistent responses to semantically equivalent inputs, indicating conflicting knowledge encoded within its parameters. Caused by biases in the training data, decoding strategies, or errors introduced during knowledge editing.

These conflicts can significantly impact the accuracy, reliability and robustness of LLM responses.

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the causes, manifestations and solutions for mitigating knowledge conflicts in LLMs:

1) For context-memory conflicts, solutions aim to make the LLM align with the context or its parametric knowledge depending on the objective. This includes techniques like specialized prompting, training discriminators, and contrastive decoding.

2) For inter-context conflicts, solutions focus on detecting or eliminating contradictions in the context using tools like search engines and code interpreters. Improving model robustness is also explored.

3) For intra-memory conflicts, solutions enhance knowledge consistency via fine-tuning, ensemble outputs, and contrastive layer selection during decoding.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic taxonomy of 3 knowledge conflict types in LLMs
- Analysis of causes, model behaviors, and solutions for each conflict category
- Identification of limitations like overreliance on synthetic conflicts and lack of multimodal, multilingual focus 
- Outlining promising future work like conflict analysis for downstream tasks, interplay between conflicts, explainability, and multimodality.

The paper provides a comprehensive reference for knowledge conflicts in LLMs, their intricacies, impact on models, and how they may be addressed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge conflicts in large language models, categorizing them into context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflicts, analyzing their causes, model behaviors, and potential solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of knowledge conflicts in large language models (LLMs). The key contributions are:

1) It categorizes knowledge conflicts into three main types - context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflicts. The paper explores the causes, model behaviors, and solutions for each conflict type. 

2) It provides an in-depth analysis of how LLMs respond when confronted with conflicting information from different sources. The analysis covers factors that influence model behaviors such as coherence, semantic meaning, order of information, etc.

3) It reviews and organizes various solutions based on their objectives and timing relative to the conflicts. Key solution categories include being faithful to context or memory, disentangling knowledge sources, and improving factuality.  

4) The paper identifies limitations of current research such as reliance on artificial conflicts and assumed priors. It also outlines important future research directions in areas like multimodality, explainability, cross-lingual capabilities, and downstream task evaluations.

In summary, the key contribution is a systematic taxonomy and analysis of knowledge conflicts in LLMs, providing insights into an evolving research area and guiding future work towards building more robust language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper on knowledge conflicts for large language models:

1. This paper categorizes knowledge conflicts into three main types: context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflicts. Could you elaborate on the key differences and interrelationships between these three conflict types? What are some potential scenarios where multiple conflict types could arise simultaneously?

2. The paper discusses causes of context-memory conflicts like temporal misalignment and misinformation pollution. In your view, what are some emerging factors that could exacerbate context-memory conflicts for large language models in the future?  

3. One mitigation approach mentioned is knowledge editing to directly update the model's parameters. What are some potential pitfalls or downstream impacts of editing a model's knowledge that should be considered?

4. For inter-context conflicts, the paper focuses on misinformation and outdated facts as primary causes. Are there any other possible causes of conflicts between multiple external contexts that should be explored further?  

5. This survey identifies specialized models, general models, training approaches and query augmentation as strategies for addressing inter-context conflicts. Do you see any limitations or room for improvement in existing approaches? What novel techniques could be promising?

6. The causes discussed for intra-memory conflicts include biases in training corpora, decoding strategies, and knowledge editing. In your opinion, which of these factors poses the greatest risk for unpredictable model behaviors leading to intra-memory conflicts?

7. What are your thoughts on the analysis of latent knowledge representations across transformer layers contributing to intra-memory conflicts? Do you see this as a crucial issue warranting further investigation?

8. Fine-tuning, knowledge plug-ins, and output ensembles are some techniques suggested for improving knowledge consistency within models. What challenges do you foresee in applying these techniques at scale for large models? 

9. This survey identifies evaluating conflicts in downstream tasks and examining multilinguality as fruitful avenues for future work. What are your perspectives on the value and feasibility of progress in these directions? What problems need to be solved first?

10. One limitation acknowledged is the artificial construction of conflicts in existing literature. What steps would you suggest to facilitate analysis of more authentic, real-world knowledge conflicts encountered by large language models? What data or evaluation capabilities are needed?
