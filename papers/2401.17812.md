# [Deterministic Computing Power Networking: Architecture, Technologies and   Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Emerging applications like AI, autonomous driving, cloud VR, and intelligent manufacturing have high demands for ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth, and ultra-strong computing power. However, the traditional "best effort" networks cannot meet these requirements. Although computing power networking (CPN) connects distributed computing resources, it does not ensure transmission and computation determinacy. Therefore, there is a need for a new network paradigm to enable deterministic, high-performance computing-network convergence.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes deterministic computing power networking (Det-CPN) which integrates network and computing resources to provide end-to-end deterministic computing-network capabilities. The key capabilities include:

1) Deterministic transmission: Provides bounded low latency and zero jitter using technologies like time sensitive networking (TSN), 5G, deterministic networking (DetNet), and segment routing (SR).

2) Deterministic computing: Ensures computing tasks complete within required time constraints using mechanisms like task prioritization, resource reservation/locking, and elastic resource scaling. 

3) Intelligent decision-making: Uses AI for computing-network modeling, optimization, and autonomous management.

The architecture has an infrastructure layer, a computing-network convergence layer with centralized control and execution planes, and an application layer. The workflow involves perception, modeling/analysis, task scheduling, network/computing control, and result return.

Main Contributions:

- Identifies needs and motivations for convergent deterministic computing-networking with analysis of intelligent driving, Cloud VR, and manufacturing use cases.

- Proposes Det-CPN architecture and details technological capabilities and system workflow. 

- Analyzes key enabling technologies like edge/wide area/DC network determinacy and computing determinacy techniques.

- Discusses research challenges and future directions in integrated computing-networking modeling/control, forwarding-computing-caching integration, and transmission control optimization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the deterministic computing power networking method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions computation-intensive and time-sensitive applications as a motivation for Det-CPN. Can you expand on what specific characteristics of these applications make determinacy in transmission and computation necessary?

2. The architecture separates infrastructure, convergence, and application layers. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of layered architecture? Could an alternative non-layered architecture achieve the goals of Det-CPN?

3. The technological capabilities discuss deterministic transmission, computing, and intelligent decision-making abilities. How are these capabilities interrelated and dependent on each other? Could Det-CPN function without one? 

4. The workflow shows a linear step-by-step process. Would an iterative workflow focused on continuous optimization be better suited for the dynamics of Det-CPN? Why or why not?

5. For edge network determinacy, what are the limitations of 5G and TSN technologies regarding scalability and flexibility? How can these be addressed?

6. The paper discusses DetNet and SR for wide area network determinacy. What are the differences in their approaches and what use cases would favor one over the other?

7. Lossless networking is proposed for data center determinacy. What modifications would be required for existing data center infrastructure to enable lossless capabilities?

8. The computing determinacy mechanisms aim to avoid task queuing and waiting. How do these mechanisms account for unused reserved resources and potential over-provisioning?

9. What existing scheduling algorithms, machine learning techniques, or optimization methods could be applied to the intelligent decision-making capability?

10. The paper focuses on technical capabilities of Det-CPN but lacks discussion of business, policy, and standardization challenges. Can you highlight some of these non-technical challenges for Det-CPN adoption?
