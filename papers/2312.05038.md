# [Prompt-In-Prompt Learning for Universal Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05038)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel prompt-in-prompt learning approach for universal image restoration. It involves learning two types of prompts - a high-level degradation-aware prompt that encodes semantic knowledge of degradation types, and a low-level basic restoration prompt that provides textural details needed for restoration. These prompts are fused via a prompt-to-prompt interaction module to generate an interpretable universal restoration prompt. This prompt then selectively modulates the most degradation-related features of the image through a prompt-to-feature interaction module. Extensive experiments on image denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring and low-light enhancement demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach is shown to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate into existing models. Key advantages are flexibility, interpretability, and enhanced performance on both seen and unseen degradations. The approach opens promising directions for prompt learning in low-level vision tasks.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Prompt learning - The paper proposes using prompt learning, which has shown success in natural language domains, for the task of universal image restoration. 

- Prompt-in-prompt learning - The paper specifically proposes a novel "prompt-in-prompt" learning approach involving learning two types of prompts: (1) a high-level degradation-aware prompt and (2) a low-level basic restoration prompt. These are then fused to generate a universal restoration prompt.

- Universal image restoration - The goal is to develop a single model capable of restoring images across various degradation types (e.g. noise, blur, low-light, etc.) as opposed to separate specialized models. 

- Degradation-aware prompt - One of the two prompts learned, intended to provide high-level knowledge of the degradation type.

- Basic restoration prompt - The other prompt learned, provides low-level texture/detail information to guide the restoration process. 

- Prompt-to-prompt interaction - A module proposed to fuse the degradation-aware and basic restoration prompts to produce the final universal restoration prompt.

- Selective prompt-to-feature interaction - Another module proposed to selectively modulate only the most degradation-relevant features based on the universal prompt.

- Interpretability, flexibility, efficiency - Desirable attributes highlighted for the proposed approach in terms of understanding, controlling, and practical usage.
