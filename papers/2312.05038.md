# [Prompt-In-Prompt Learning for Universal Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05038)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel prompt-in-prompt learning approach for universal image restoration. It involves learning two types of prompts - a high-level degradation-aware prompt that encodes semantic knowledge of degradation types, and a low-level basic restoration prompt that provides textural details needed for restoration. These prompts are fused via a prompt-to-prompt interaction module to generate an interpretable universal restoration prompt. This prompt then selectively modulates the most degradation-related features of the image through a prompt-to-feature interaction module. Extensive experiments on image denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring and low-light enhancement demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach is shown to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate into existing models. Key advantages are flexibility, interpretability, and enhanced performance on both seen and unseen degradations. The approach opens promising directions for prompt learning in low-level vision tasks.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image restoration aims to restore high-quality images from degraded images affected by noise, blur, low-light etc. Conventional methods rely on task-specific models, which have high storage costs and limited flexibility. Recently, research has focused on universal restoration models that can handle multiple degradations using a single model. However, existing approaches still require task-specific training or parameters and have limited performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper proposes a novel "Prompt-in-Prompt" (PIP) learning approach for universal image restoration. The key idea is to learn two types of prompts:
    1) Degradation-aware prompt: Encodes high-level degradation knowledge (e.g. "noise", "blur").
    2) Basic restoration prompt: Provides low-level texture/structure information to guide restoration.

- These prompts are fused via a prompt-to-prompt (P2P) interaction module to generate a universal restoration prompt. This prompt provides both semantic information about the degradation type and detailed features to facilitate restoration.

- A selective prompt-to-feature (P2F) interaction module then uses this prompt to modulate the most relevant features in the image for restoration.

- PIP works as a lightweight plug-and-play module that can enhance existing restoration models like Restormer and NAFNet for universal restoration, without much added cost.

Main Contributions:
- Novel prompt-in-prompt learning using high-level and low-level prompts for universal restoration.
- P2P interaction fuses prompts into an effective universal restoration prompt.
- Selective P2F interaction focuses modulation on pertinent features.  
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across various tasks like denoising, deblurring etc.
- PIP is interpretable, flexible, efficient and easy to use.

In summary, this paper presents an innovative prompt learning approach to enhance existing models for universal image restoration via degradation-aware and basic restoration prompts. The fused prompt guides restoration by identifying degradation types and providing essential textural information.
