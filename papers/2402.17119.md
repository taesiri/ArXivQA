# [Creating Suspenseful Stories: Iterative Planning with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automated story generation, especially around suspenseful narratives, remains challenging for AI systems. Suspense emerges under specific conditions related to a protagonist facing threats, failing at plans, etc. that are hard to model computationally. 
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, while fluent, struggle to reliably generate suspenseful stories in a zero-shot setting without fine-tuning on suspense corpora.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an iterative prompting-based planning technique to guide LLMs to generate suspense, grounded in psychological theories around suspense requiring:
  - A protagonist with a concrete goal
  - Repeated failures of protagonist plans/actions to meet goal
  - Diminishing feasible alternatives for protagonist with time running out
- The technique has a background setup stage, an outline planning stage with adversarial action/failure generation, and a detail elaboration stage.

Key Contributions:
- First work exploring suspenseful story generation with large language models in a zero-shot setting
- Validated, theory-grounded technique for iteratively planning outline and adversarially blocking protagonist plans
- Extensive human evaluations demonstrating suspense improvement over baselines
- Analysis of factors influencing suspense (clues, information reveal timing, reader empathy)
- Showcases how creative genre-specific narrative generation can be achieved by structuring the problem around theoretical foundations

In summary, the paper tackles the challenging problem of suspenseful story generation using an iterative planning approach grounded in suspense theories. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the promise of this technique to expand the creative capabilities of LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new method for generating suspenseful stories using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper:

1) Brings together psychological theories of suspense and modern LLM-based language generation techniques to address the problem of suspenseful story generation. This is framed as the first attempt at suspenseful story generation with LLMs.

2) Proposes an "iterative-prompting-based planning" technique that guides the LLM through adversarial generation of a suspenseful story outline. This method works in a zero-shot way without relying on any supervised story corpora.

3) Conducts extensive human evaluations demonstrating the proposed method can effectively produce suspenseful stories that are preferred over baseline LLM-generated stories across several metrics including suspense, enjoyment, and novelty.

4) Performs ablation studies and examinations of the generated story outlines to validate that the components of the proposed technique are working as expected internally.

5) Leverages the validated suspenseful story generation method to run controlled experiments that uncover factors that affect human perceptions of suspense in stories.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a new zero-shot method for suspenseful story generation with LLMs, enabled by bringing together psychological theories of suspense and modern language models. The method is also used to advance understanding of suspense as a phenomenon.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative-prompting-based planning technique. Can you explain in detail how this technique works and what are the key steps involved? 

2. The background setup stage establishes the protagonist, goal, and potential negative outcome. What specific information does this stage aim to generate and how is the language model prompted to produce it?

3. Outline planning iteratively creates possible actions for the protagonist and reasons for failure. What is the purpose of this adversarial approach and how does it aim to increase suspense?

4. During detail elaboration, event sequences are generated from the action-reason pairs. How are these event sequences structured to reveal information in different ways to manipulate suspense?

5. The paper incorporates optional designs like clue setup and information revelation timing. Can you analyze how these options work and discuss their impact on suspense based on the theories presented?

6. What are the key suspense-related theories from psychology and narratology that inspired and grounded the design of this method? Explain how the method aims to operationalize those theories.  

7. The evaluation relies heavily on human judgment across multiple criteria. Why is human evaluation critical for assessing the success of this creative generation task?

8. What are the major findings from the comparison against baseline methods and ablation studies? How do they support the efficacy of this approach?

9. The paper investigates factors like clue setup and empathy that impact suspense. Can you summarize what was learned about how different techniques affect reader suspense perceptions? 

10. What are some limitations of this work and what future directions could be pursued to address them and advance suspenseful story generation?
