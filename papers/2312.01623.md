# [Universal Segmentation at Arbitrary Granularity with Language   Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01623)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a universal segmentation model called UniLSeg that can segment images at arbitrary semantic granularity based on language instructions. The authors reorganize several segmentation tasks into a unified format consisting of an image, ground truth mask, and language caption describing the segmentation target. A two-stage pre-training strategy is used - first on a large dataset of images from SA-1B, then on a mix of supervised segmentation datasets and additional pseudo-labeled data automatically generated from weakly annotated images. The UniLSeg model consists of visual and text encoders, a pre-fusion cross-attention module to incorporate text guidance into visual features, and two-path visual-linguistic decoding with self- and cross-attention to align features and generate the output mask. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on referring image segmentation, salient object detection, semantic segmentation, part segmentation and other tasks. The flexible use of language captions to guide segmentation at multiple semantic levels is a key advantage over prior specialized models. An automatic annotation engine to generate caption-mask pairs from unlabeled images further improves results. In conclusion, language guidance and extensive pre-training enables the proposed UniLSeg model to achieve versatile, universal segmentation capabilities beyond current approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents UniLSeg, a universal segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with the guidance of language instructions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents UniLSeg, a generic segmentation model that fully integrates visual concept with textual guidance. With language instructions as universal prompt, UniLSeg can be jointly trained on multiple tasks to learn the connections between diverse textual descriptions and visual content, achieving universal segmentation at arbitrary semantic granularity.

2. UniLSeg achieves superior performance on a group of challenging benchmarks from various tasks, which benefits from the language-based paradigm definition and additional automatic annotation engine for large-scale unlabeled and weakly-labeled data.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) proposing UniLSeg, a unified segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with language instructions, and (2) achieving excellent performance on various segmentation tasks by leveraging language-based paradigm and additional unlabeled/weakly-labeled data.
