# [Learning to Retrieve In-Context Examples for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07164)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we train dense retrievers to identify high-quality in-context examples for large language models in order to improve their in-context learning performance?The authors propose a novel framework called LLM-R that aims to iteratively train dense retrievers using feedback from the language model itself, in order to retrieve examples that are most useful for improving the language model's ability to perform tasks using few-shot prompting. Specifically, the framework first generates training data by ranking candidate examples based on the language model's conditional log-probabilities. It then trains a reward model to capture the language model's rankings. Finally, it trains a bi-encoder dense retriever using knowledge distillation from the reward model.The central hypothesis is that by training dense retrievers in this way, specifically tailored to the language model, the retriever will be able to identify examples that allow the language model to learn more effectively in context. The authors evaluate this on a diverse set of NLP tasks and find that their method outperforms baselines in enabling in-context learning.In summary, the key research question is how to train retrievers optimized for in-context learning for LLMs, and the central hypothesis is that their proposed LLM-R framework will improve language model performance by retrieving high-quality examples.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in in-context learning and retrieval augmentation for large language models:- The overall goal of learning to retrieve high-quality examples for in-context learning aligns with several other recent works, including UPRISE, REPLUG, and unified task retrieval. However, this paper proposes a more comprehensive training framework involving reward modeling and distillation.- Compared to related work that focuses on smaller models like GPT-2, this paper evaluates the method on much larger models like LLaMA-7B. The scalability is quite impressive.- The paper conducts very thorough experiments across 30 diverse NLP datasets. This is one of the most extensive evaluations I've seen, and really tests generalization across tasks.- The proposed framework outperforms strong baselines like BM25 and off-the-shelf dense retrievers. The gains are quite significant (+7.8% average).- Analysis of when the method works well vs not is insightful. Retrieval helps most on classification tasks with similar patterns. But for knowledge-intensive tasks, the base LLM capability matters more.- The idea of using reward modeling and distillation to learn from LLM feedback seems novel compared to prior work. And the iterative training process allows mining better examples.- For generalization, testing on unseen tasks and unseen LLMs is important. Positive results on both dimensions highlight the versatility of the framework.Overall, this seems like a significant advance on an important problem. The comprehensive training approach and extensive empirical evaluation set it apart from prior efforts. If I had to summarize, I'd say this paper pushes the state-of-the-art on optimizing retrievers for in-context learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions suggested by the authors:- Test the framework on more diverse and challenging tasks to further analyze when it works well and when it doesn't. The authors mention evaluating on tasks with non-overlapping categories as one example.- Explore different methods for modeling the interaction between in-context examples, such as using determinantal point processes or sequential decision making. The current approach treats each example independently. - Experiment with retrieving examples from external corpora beyond just the training set. This could potentially bring in more up-to-date factual knowledge.- Study the effectiveness of iterative training with more than just 3 iterations. The gains seem to diminish after 2 iterations in the current experiments.- Analyze the impact of using different language models for candidate ranking versus final evaluation. The authors find the evaluation LM is more important in their experiments.- Scale up the framework in terms of number of retrieved examples and retriever model size. The authors provide some initial experiments but more investigation can be done.- Evaluate the generalization ability to more unseen tasks, especially unseen task categories. The held-out tasks in the paper overlap in categories with the training tasks.- Perform a more thorough analysis and case studies to better understand when the approach is most beneficial. The authors provide some high-level discussion but more can be done.In summary, the main future directions are centered around scaling and analyzing the framework along different dimensions, testing the generalization capability, and gaining more insights through case studies and qualitative analysis.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called LLM-R to iteratively train dense retrievers that can identify high-quality in-context examples for large language models (LLMs). The framework first trains a reward model based on LLM feedback to evaluate candidate examples. It then uses knowledge distillation to train a bi-encoder dense retriever model. At test time, the retriever identifies relevant examples from a pool to provide context for the LLM to perform a task. The authors conduct experiments on 30 diverse NLP tasks using LLaMA-7B as the LLM. Results show that LLM-R improves in-context learning performance by 7.8% on average compared to random selection of examples. The model also generalizes well to held-out tasks and varying LLM sizes. Analysis reveals that LLM-R tends to retrieve examples with similar patterns or labels, which is particularly effective for classification tasks. However, performance gains are smaller for knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering that rely more on the LLM's capabilities. Overall, the paper demonstrates a promising approach to enhance in-context learning by retrieving high-quality examples.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called LLM-R to iteratively train dense retrievers for selecting high-quality in-context examples for large language models (LLMs). The framework first generates training data by using an initial retriever (BM25) to retrieve candidate examples and then ranks them based on the conditional log-likelihood scores from the LLM on producing the ground-truth output. A cross-encoder reward model is trained on the ranked candidates to capture the preferences of the LLM. Finally, a bi-encoder dense retriever is trained with knowledge distillation using the soft labels predicted by the reward model. This pipeline can be iterated by retrieving new candidates using the latest retriever. The overall goal is to learn a customized dense retriever that can identify informative examples to enhance the in-context learning performance of LLMs on downstream tasks.

 Based on my reading, the key points about this paper are:- It proposes a new framework called LLM-R for retrieving high-quality in-context examples to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks through in-context learning. - The problem it aims to address is that in-context learning with LLMs can be very sensitive to the quality of the examples provided, but selecting good examples is challenging. Prior work has limitations in terms of the language model size or training methodology. - The main research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective framework to retrieve high-quality in-context examples for large language models?- To address this, the paper introduces a pipeline involving candidate retrieval, reward modeling to capture LLM preferences, and training a dense retriever with distillation. This pipeline allows mining better examples through multiple iterations.So in summary, the key problem is improving in-context learning for LLMs by developing a way to retrieve better quality illustrative examples from the training set. The LLM-R framework is proposed to address this problem.
