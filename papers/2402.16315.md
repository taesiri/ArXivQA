# [Finer: Investigating and Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Concept   Recognition in Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) like LLaVA and InstructBLIP show strong performance on high-level image description and reasoning. 
- However, the paper investigates their ability on fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across 6 datasets and finds severe performance degradation - average 65.58% drop in accuracy for LLaVA-1.5 on Stanford Dogs dataset from superordinate to fine-grained labels.
- The models also struggle to generate accurate fine-grained explanations of concepts in images, despite capabilities for holistic image descriptions.

Proposed Solution:
- In-depth analyses reveal a "modality gap" - discrepancy between textual and visual inputs for the same concepts, limiting image modality from leveraging rich text knowledge.
- The authors propose a new benchmark, Finer, to evaluate fine-grained visual comprehension and explainability of LVLMs. It has:
   - Multiple label granularity levels 
   - Concept-centric attribute sets per fine-grained label
   - Covers diverse real-world objects over 6 FGVC datasets

Key Contributions:
- Show lack of fine-grained visual understanding in state-of-the-art LVLMs 
- Identify modality gap causing inferior FGVC performance
- Propose Finer benchmark to promote model evaluation on fine-grained comprehension and explainability
- Finer tuning on new mixture of instructions helps close modality gap and improves held-out FGVC dataset accuracy

In summary, the paper clearly identifies limitations of LVLMs on fine-grained tasks, traces the causes to modality discrepancy, and contributes a valuable benchmark to advance progress in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the lack of fine-grained visual comprehension in large vision-language models, finding they struggle with detailed image understanding and exhibit a discrepancy ("modality gap") between processing visual and textual inputs of concepts, proposing a benchmark to evaluate fine-grained classification and attribute generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Highlighting the lack of fine-grained image comprehension ability of recent instruction-tuned large vision-language models (LVLMs) across various real-life objects. The paper is the first to explore fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) as an evaluation criteria for these models.

2. Demonstrating the persistence of modality gap within LVLMs by conducting an extensive per-modality-based probing. This reveals the discrepancy in how the visual and textual modalities are processed by these models. 

3. Constructing a novel attribute-centric, multi-granularity benchmark on FGVC datasets called "Finer" to open up a new direction to measure LVLMs' modality gap and their fine-grained image understanding capability. Fine-tuning on Finer is shown to help close the modality gap and improve FGVC accuracy for held-out datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing Finer, a new benchmark to evaluate fine-grained visual comprehension in LVLMs, which highlights and helps address limitations of current models in leveraging textual knowledge for fine-grained image classification.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Large vision-language models (LVLMs)
- Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) 
- Instruction tuning
- Modality gap
- Attribute-centric evaluation
- Explainability
- Fine-grained comprehension
- iNaturalist, Stanford Dogs, CUB-200, NABirds (datasets)

The paper investigates the lack of ability of current state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 to perform fine-grained visual classification across different benchmark datasets. It reveals the existence of a "modality gap" between how these models process textual and visual inputs of concepts. The paper also proposes a new attribute-centric, multiple granularity benchmark called "Finer" to evaluate fine-grained comprehension in LVLMs. So the key focus areas are FGVC, modality gap, and benchmarking comprehension in VLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark called FINER for evaluating fine-grained visual concept recognition in large vision-language models. What are the key motivations behind developing this new benchmark? How does it aim to assess capabilities beyond existing benchmarks?

2. The paper highlights a "modality gap" issue in current vision-language models, showing discrepancy between how they process textual and visual inputs of concepts. Can you explain this modality gap finding in more detail? What experiments and analyses were done to evidence this? 

3. The FINER benchmark incorporates multiple granularity levels for concepts (superordinate, coarse, fine) and rich attribute annotations per concept. What is the significance of having this multi-granularity aspect? How do the attribute annotations aim to provide greater explainability?

4. The paper proposes an "AttrSeek" prompting strategy to elicit fine-grained attributes from models before concept classification. How exactly does this strategy work? What intuition or hypothesis lies behind using it?  

5. How was the FINER dataset constructed from existing fine-grained classification datasets? What additional processing was done to generate attributes, granularity levels etc. for concepts?

6. What zero-shot transfer learning experiment was done in Section 4.3 using instruction tuning on FINER? What results were shown regarding benefits to held-out fine-grained classification?

7. The paper argues vision-language models exhibit a "lack of fine-grained image comprehension ability". What key results support this argument? What metrics and analyses quantify this? 

8. Qualitative analyses in Table 4 highlight differences between text-only and image-only attribute generation. What trends can you summarize regarding these differences? How do they provide further evidence of the modality gap?

9. Could the elicitive prompting strategies explored in Section 3.2, like Chain-of-Thought and AttrSeek, be incorporated in the FINER benchmark going forward? If so, how?

10. The authors mention some limitations around intra-concept variance and choice of baseline models. Can you expand on these limitations and how they might be addressed in future work?
