# [A Survey on Data Selection for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of data selection methods for language model training. The key goal is to provide a unified framework to compare, understand and guide research on optimizing the data used to train language models. 

The paper first establishes background concepts around data points, datasets and distributions. It then proposes a general framework that decomposes data selection methods into two key components - a utility function that scores data points, and a selection mechanism that determines whether to keep/repeat data points based on this score.  

The paper organizes data selection techniques over 5 common training regimes for language models - pretraining, instruction tuning, alignment, in-context learning and task-specific fine-tuning. For each regime, it surveys the utility functions, selection mechanisms and overall goals employed, using representative techniques as examples. Crucially, the unified framework allows these diverse techniques to be compared in a common language.

The paper distills the best practices, tradeoffs and limitations around data selection in language models. It highlights open challenges like developing fast methods to directly evaluate data quality without expensive model training, creating common benchmarks, transferring selection criteria across settings like tokenizers or data scale, and addressing equity concerns introduced by filtering.

The paper concludes by outlining promising future directions centered on clarifying selection objectives, shifting compute from model training to data processing, and accelerating research through metrics that directly quantify data characteristics, public challenges and open-sourced tools.

Overall, this paper makes two key contributions - (1) a taxonomy and unified conceptual framework to understand the breadth of data selection methods (2) a comprehensive survey of techniques employed across various language model training regimes, along with their merits, limitations and open questions. The paper aims to catalyze progress by laying a structured foundation for newcomers and highlighting fruitful research directions for experts.
