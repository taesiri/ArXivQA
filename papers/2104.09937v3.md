# [Gradient Matching for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09937v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new algorithm called Fish for domain generalization. The main research question it aims to address is: How can we design a domain generalization algorithm that exploits features invariant across domains to improve generalization to unseen domains?The key ideas and contributions are:- It proposes a new objective called inter-domain gradient matching (IDGM) that encourages alignment of gradients across domains. This is motivated by the goal of finding invariances across domains. - It shows theoretically and empirically that standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) can fail to exploit invariant features for generalization.- It derives an efficient first-order approximation to IDGM called Fish. This avoids the computational cost of computing second derivatives.- It demonstrates strong performance of Fish on a range of domain generalization benchmarks, showing it is broadly applicable. Fish matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.- It analyzes Fish and shows empirically that it increases gradient alignment across domains compared to ERM.In summary, the key hypothesis is that maximizing gradient alignment across domains will enable learning invariances that improve generalization. The paper proposes and evaluates the Fish algorithm to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new method called inter-domain gradient matching (IDGM) for domain generalization. The key ideas are:- IDGM aims to learn features that are invariant across different domains by maximizing the inner product between gradients from different domains. This aligns the optimization path and encourages the model to rely on invariant features. - Direct optimization of IDGM requires computationally expensive second-order derivatives. To address this, the authors propose a first-order approximation algorithm called Fish, inspired by meta-learning methods like Reptile. - Fish performs multiple gradient steps on minibatches from different domains, and aggregates the updates to approximate the IDGM objective. This avoids directly computing second derivatives.- Experiments on Wilds and DomainBed benchmarks show Fish achieves competitive performance across diverse domain generalization tasks, demonstrating its versatility. It outperforms baselines on most datasets.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the IDGM objective and an efficient first-order Fish algorithm to optimize it for domain generalization. The method is simple yet effective on benchmarks with different data modalities and domain shift characteristics.
