# [Exact verification of the strong BSD conjecture for some absolutely   simple abelian surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.0325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper aims to verify the strong BSD conjecture for certain absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of genus 2 curves obtained as Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). Specifically, it shows that the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial for 28 such surfaces. The key hypotheses that enable proving this are:- The surfaces are modular, so their L-functions are known and satisfy the analytic continuation and functional equation. - They are absolutely simple, so associated to a single newform.- The newforms have analytic rank 0 or 1, so the weak BSD conjecture is known. - The residual Galois representations are irreducible for almost all primes.The main tools used are:- Computing the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group.- Determining the image of residual Galois representations. - Computing the Heegner index.- Bounding and computing Selmer groups using isogeny descent. - Verifying cases of the Iwasawa main conjecture using $p$-adic L-functions.By combining these, the paper is able to show the Shafarevich-Tate group is finite of order equal to the analytic prediction, and hence trivial. This verifies the strong BSD conjecture for these 28 surfaces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture, which predicts the size of the Shafarevich-Tate group, for certain absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces over the rational numbers by showing this group is trivial.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on verifying the BSD conjecture:- This paper focuses specifically on verifying the strong BSD conjecture for absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of genus 2 curves. Much previous work has focused on verifying BSD for elliptic curves, so this extends the techniques to higher dimensional abelian varieties.- The paper relies heavily on the methods of Kolyvagin and Logachev for bounding the size of Shafarevich-Tate groups using Heegner points. These techniques have been widely used in other work on BSD as well. - The paper makes significant use of algorithms and software like Magma to carry out explicit computations. Other recent work verifying BSD, like the work of Jetchev et al., has also emphasized the computational side.- The paper verifies BSD in some new cases by handling all the absolutely simple Jacobians of Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N) curves of genus 2. Previous computational work had verified the analytic order of Sha for most of these curves, so this completes the proof.- The techniques used seem fairly standard for BSD work nowadays - Heegner points, Kolyvagin methods, Magma algorithms, etc. So this paper extends the state of the art in a natural way, rather than introducing brand new techniques.Overall, this seems like an incremental but solid contribution, continuing along a research program of verifying BSD in new cases using the latest algorithms and software. The focus on genus 2 curves is novel, but the methods are fairly conventional. It would mainly be of interest to researchers working on BSD, computational number theory, and explicit calculations with modular forms.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the computations to additional absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are not Jacobians of Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). The authors plan to consider some further two-dimensional absolutely simple isogeny factors of J_0(N).- Investigating whether their algorithms and results can be extended to higher genus modular curves and their Jacobians. The methods presented focus on genus 2 curves, so studying if they generalize is an open question.- Exploring connections to the integral Iwasawa main conjecture and fine Selmer groups. The authors indicate their computation of the p-adic L-functions gives information about Selmer groups assuming the IMC, so further study of the IMC and fine Selmer groups could yield more insights.- Considering analogues and generalizations over other number fields besides Q. The strong BSD conjecture and construction of Heegner points extends more broadly, so extending the computations to modular abelian varieties over other number fields is a natural direction.- Optimizing the algorithms and implementation to handle more complex examples. As the authors note, optimizing their Magma implementation could allow tackling additional cases.In summary, the main suggestions involve broadening the class of examples, generalizing to higher genus curves, studying finer arithmetic invariants like Selmer groups, and extending the setting from Q to other global fields. Improving the algorithms is also noted as beneficial for handling more complicated cases going forward.
