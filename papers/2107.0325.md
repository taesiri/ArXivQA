# [Exact verification of the strong BSD conjecture for some absolutely   simple abelian surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.0325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper aims to verify the strong BSD conjecture for certain absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of genus 2 curves obtained as Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). Specifically, it shows that the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial for 28 such surfaces. The key hypotheses that enable proving this are:- The surfaces are modular, so their L-functions are known and satisfy the analytic continuation and functional equation. - They are absolutely simple, so associated to a single newform.- The newforms have analytic rank 0 or 1, so the weak BSD conjecture is known. - The residual Galois representations are irreducible for almost all primes.The main tools used are:- Computing the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group.- Determining the image of residual Galois representations. - Computing the Heegner index.- Bounding and computing Selmer groups using isogeny descent. - Verifying cases of the Iwasawa main conjecture using $p$-adic L-functions.By combining these, the paper is able to show the Shafarevich-Tate group is finite of order equal to the analytic prediction, and hence trivial. This verifies the strong BSD conjecture for these 28 surfaces.
