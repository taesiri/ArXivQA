# [Hierarchical NeuroSymbolic Approach for Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing approaches for action quality assessment (AQA) rely on subjective and potentially biased scores from human judges as ground truth for training neural network models. This leads to issues with fairness, transparency, and explainability.
- Neural AQA models also just output a single score without any explanation of what was done well or poorly, making them less useful for providing actionable feedback to improve performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural networks and rule-based systems to address the limitations of prior AQA methods.
- Neural networks are used to extract symbolic information (e.g. athlete pose, platform location, splash detection) from videos. 
- Rules encoded with domain expertise then analyze these symbols to recognize dive types, temporally segment phases, and assess quality in a transparent, objective manner.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates the first application of a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA to bring improved accountability, fairness, and trustworthiness compared to purely neural approaches.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results for fine-grained action recognition and temporal segmentation of dives.
- Automatically generates comprehensive visuo-linguistic feedback reports supported by visual evidence from the video.
- Provides actionable and meaningful assessments grounded in diving expertise that highlight all aspects of a dive, unlike biased singular scores from human judges or neural models.
- System and detailed dive annotations to be open-sourced to facilitate reproducibility and extensions to other sports/domains.

In summary, the key innovation is in combining neural networks and symbolic AI to objectively measure all facets of a complex human performance in order to provide rich and fair feedback. This neuro-symbolic AQA approach promises to bring trust and transparency to judging in sports and other skilled assessment tasks.
