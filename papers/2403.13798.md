# [Hierarchical NeuroSymbolic Approach for Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing approaches for action quality assessment (AQA) rely on subjective and potentially biased scores from human judges as ground truth for training neural network models. This leads to issues with fairness, transparency, and explainability.
- Neural AQA models also just output a single score without any explanation of what was done well or poorly, making them less useful for providing actionable feedback to improve performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural networks and rule-based systems to address the limitations of prior AQA methods.
- Neural networks are used to extract symbolic information (e.g. athlete pose, platform location, splash detection) from videos. 
- Rules encoded with domain expertise then analyze these symbols to recognize dive types, temporally segment phases, and assess quality in a transparent, objective manner.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates the first application of a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA to bring improved accountability, fairness, and trustworthiness compared to purely neural approaches.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results for fine-grained action recognition and temporal segmentation of dives.
- Automatically generates comprehensive visuo-linguistic feedback reports supported by visual evidence from the video.
- Provides actionable and meaningful assessments grounded in diving expertise that highlight all aspects of a dive, unlike biased singular scores from human judges or neural models.
- System and detailed dive annotations to be open-sourced to facilitate reproducibility and extensions to other sports/domains.

In summary, the key innovation is in combining neural networks and symbolic AI to objectively measure all facets of a complex human performance in order to provide rich and fair feedback. This neuro-symbolic AQA approach promises to bring trust and transparency to judging in sports and other skilled assessment tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach for action quality assessment that combines neural networks to extract symbolic information from videos and rule-based systems to analyze the symbols and generate detailed, objective scoring and feedback without relying on biased human judgements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a neuro-symbolic approach to action quality assessment (AQA) that combines neural networks and symbolic systems. Specifically:

- It introduces a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA that brings accountability, transparency, and trustworthiness to AQA and sports performance judging. This is validated on platform diving.

- The proposed hierarchical neuro-symbolic system achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained action recognition and temporal segmentation of dives. 

- The system automatically generates highly detailed performance analysis reports with objective scoring and supporting visual evidence. This can be used to assist judges, train judges, provide feedback to divers, etc.

- The neuro-symbolic approach ensures fairness and transparency in scoring, provides actionable insights to athletes and coaches, and helps minimize biases that often occur in traditional subjective human judging.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel neuro-symbolic approach for transparent, fair, and explainable action quality assessment, with a concrete implementation and validation on platform diving. The system brings interpretability and accountability to performance scoring.

The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach to action quality assessment, using diving as a case study. It employs neural networks for feature extraction and symbolic/rules-based systems for structured analysis. Key aspects include achieving state-of-the-art results on tasks like action recognition and segmentation, while also generating detailed performance reports to provide transparency and reduce bias.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural networks and symbolic AI. Can you explain in more detail how these two components are integrated and work together in the proposed system? What are the strengths that each component brings?

2. The rules-based analyzer performs hierarchical analysis - first recognizing the dive, then segmenting it temporally, and finally assessing quality. Can you walk through this hierarchy in more detail and explain the rationale behind this structured approach? 

3. The system extracts interpretable "symbols" from the video such as platform location, splash, and pose. How does the extraction of these modular symbols enable explainability and transparency compared to end-to-end neural approaches?

4. The paper emphasizes minimizing bias that exists in human judging. In what specific ways can the neuro-symbolic system help reduce biases compared to both human judges and neural network approaches trained on those biased scores?

5. The system programmatically generates detailed textual reports of the dive assessment. What is the process and methodology behind generating these reports? What templates or tools enable this automated linguistic description generation?  

6. The rules encoding domain knowledge for assessment are implemented as microprograms in Python. Can you outline the process of formulating these rules and translating them into code? What abstractions are made to enable generalizability?

7. How does the system uniquely enable personalization of scoring criteria weightings for different judges while still maintaining transparency? Why is this useful?

8. The paper evaluates both low-level tasks like action recognition as well as high-level scoring using expert surveys. What were the key results from these experiments that validate the approach over neural models?

9. What are some current failure modes and limitations of the system? How can pose estimation issues that sometimes lead to errors be ameliorated as technology progresses?

10. The paper proposes the neuro-symbolic paradigm can generalize to other sports/domains that require precise skills assessment. Can you describe what considerations must be made to extend this approach to assessing skills in domains like surgery? What domain knowledge is necessary?
