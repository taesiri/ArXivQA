# [Infinite-Horizon Graph Filters: Leveraging Power Series to Enhance   Sparse Information Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09943)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) face two key challenges - limited receptive field leading to inability to capture long-range dependencies, and performance degradation in sparse graphs with fewer edges. These limit the effectiveness of GNNs for real-world applications.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel Graph Power Filter Neural Network (GPFN) that uses power series to design graph filters. This allows capturing infinite range dependencies within a single GNN layer without over-smoothing.

- GPFN constructs graph filters using convergent power series from the spectral domain. This preserves modeling capability of infinite power series without losing information.

- The power series filters act as infinite aggregators in spatial domain, aggregating neighborhood information across infinite hops with different weights. This expands receptive field of GNNs.

- The paper provides theoretical analysis to show that GPFN can flexibly incorporate diverse power series filters like low-pass, high-pass etc. It also shows GPFN's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes novel graph power filter neural network (GPFN) using convergent power series to capture infinite range dependencies, alleviating issues in sparse graphs.

- Provides flexibility to incorporate different power series filters based on requirements.

- Theoretically analyses GPFN's capabilities from both spectral and spatial perspectives.

- Empirically demonstrates consistent superiority of GPFN over state-of-the-art GNN methods, especially in high graph sparsity contexts across multiple datasets.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through its novel GPFN methodology that leverages power series to address key challenges of limited receptive field and graph sparsity that restrict performance of GNNs. Both theoretical and empirical analyses validate the effectiveness.
