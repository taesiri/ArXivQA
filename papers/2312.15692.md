# [Instruction Fusion: Advancing Prompt Evolution through Hybridization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15692)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evolving instructions to improve code generation models (like Evol-Instruct) have limitations: instructions become excessively complex, difficulty escalates too rapidly creating gaps, and diversity is constrained to the original objective. 

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper proposes a new method called Instruction Fusion (IF) that fuses two distinct instructions into a single, more complex prompt using GPT-4 Turbo. 
- IF merges different objectives to increase difficulty more gradually and expand diversity beyond the original tasks.

Contributions:
- Instruction Fusion effectively addresses limitations of prior evolution methods for code generation models. It improves prompt complexity/diversity while ensuring a smoother escalation in difficulty.
- Experiments on CodeLlama models using 5 benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance when fine-tuned with IF instructions, advancing the state-of-the-art.
- Open-sourced model weights, training data, and code to facilitate future research.

In summary, this paper introduces Instruction Fusion to overcome deficiencies in existing code prompt evolution techniques. By fusing distinct instructions, IF enhances prompt evolution for code models, enabling significant performance gains across benchmarks and advancing the field.
