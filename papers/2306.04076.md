# [Text-only Domain Adaptation using Unified Speech-Text Representation in   Transducer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04076)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: How can we enable fast domain adaptation of end-to-end speech recognition models using only text data from the target domain, without needing to synthesize speech or modify the model architecture?The key points are:- End-to-end speech recognition models like RNN-Transducers have difficulty adapting to new domains using only text data, unlike traditional hybrid models. - Synthesizing speech for the target domain text via TTS is resource intensive. Modifying the model architecture (e.g. adding an external LM) increases complexity. - The authors propose a method to learn a unified speech-text representation within the RNN-Transducer, by adding a text encoder branch that can be removed after adaptation.- This allows adapting the model to a new domain using only unlabeled text data, without speech synthesis or architecture changes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning a joint speech-text representation will enable efficient text-only domain adaptation for end-to-end models, overcoming limitations of existing methods. The paper then presents this proposed method and experiments validating it.
