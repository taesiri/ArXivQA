# [Exploiting Liver CT scans in Colorectal Carcinoma genomics mutation   classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Colon-rectal cancer (CRC) often spreads to the liver. Knowing the genetic mutations of liver metastases is important for designing proper patient treatment. 
- Currently, mutation analysis requires invasive biopsies. The authors explore using CT scans of liver lesions to predict genetic mutations, which could enable non-invasive and repeated analysis.

Methods:
- The authors curated a dataset (CRC4AI) of 50 CRC patients with annotated CT scans and mutation analysis from liver biopsy. There were 92 liver lesions across 5 gene mutations.
- They extract 2D slices of the lesions and surrounding tissue from the 3D CT scans.
- A CNN (EfficientNet backbone) is pretrained in a self-supervised manner on unrelated liver CT data to extract relevant features. 
- The pretrained CNN is then trained to classify lesions in CRC4AI data into 1 of 5 gene mutations. Data balancing and k-fold cross validation is used.

Results:
- Classifying 5 mutations had low performance, so mutations were grouped into 3 classes (NRAS+KRAS, BRAF+PIK3CA, OTHER).
- Best model was EfficientNet pretrained on liver CT data and with an added self-attention layer, achieving 0.73 F1 score for classifying RAS mutations.

Conclusions:
- This is the first study exploring CT scan prediction of CRC liver metastasis gene mutations using deep learning.
- Despite the small dataset, RAS mutations could be identified with good accuracy, showing potential for non-invasive mutation prediction to guide CRC patient treatment.
- More data and 3D analysis may further improve performance and allow classification of additional mutations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a deep learning approach using efficient networks, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised pretraining to classify colorectal cancer liver metastasis mutations from CT images, achieving promising results in identifying RAS mutations with 0.73 F1 score despite the very small dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first deep learning-based approach, to the authors' knowledge, for classifying colorectal cancer (CRC) gene mutations from CT images of liver metastases. Specifically:

1) They propose a pipeline for managing undersized datasets of available CT scans and establish a baseline for genomics mutation diagnosis from CT images. 

2) They use self-supervised pretraining on out-of-distribution datasets to improve performance on their small target dataset. 

3) They achieve promising results, including 0.73 F1 score for identifying the RAS mutation family from CT images. This is notable given the difficulty of the task and small dataset size.

4) They highlight an underexplored and challenging problem in computer-aided diagnosis and put forward their work as a basis for future non-invasive solutions for CRC genomics identification. Overall, it is a preliminary but promising step towards mutation prediction from medical images rather than invasive biopsies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach (SimCLR) to pretrain the model on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Why was a self-supervised method chosen over a supervised pretraining approach? What are the key benefits of using self-supervised learning in this application?

2. The model architectures utilize EfficientNet as a backbone. What are the key properties and advantages of EfficientNet that make it well-suited as a backbone model for this type of medical image analysis task? 

3. Data augmentation is used during both the SimCLR pretraining stage and the final model training. What types of augmentations are applied and why are certain augmentations better suited for this task? 

4. Attention mechanisms have shown benefits in various vision tasks. The paper evaluates models with and without a self-attention layer. What is the intuition behind why attention may help in this mutation prediction task from CT scan slices?

5. The paper grouped some of the mutation labels together into combined categories (NRAS + KRAS and PIK3CA + BRAF). What was the rationale behind these groupings? What kind of biological or imaging-based similarities motivated aggregating them this way?

6. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, with some mutation labels being much less frequent than others. What data balancing strategy did the authors use to account for this? Why was this approach chosen over other balancing techniques like oversampling or loss re-weighting?

7. The model takes 2D CT scan slices as input rather than full 3D volumes. What limitations of the dataset motivated this design choice? In what ways could a 3D approach improve if more data were available?

8. How exactly do the proposed models output multi-label predictions at the lesion level from the 2D slice inputs? Does each slice make an independent prediction and these are aggregated? Or is there a shared representation used across slices?

9. The variety of patient distribution in the dataset could bias the validation metrics if not accounted for properly. What validation methodology did the authors use to mitigate patient-specific biases? Why is this more robust than standard train-test splitting?

10. The RAS mutation family achieved the best performance - F1 score of 0.73. What are some possible reasons why this particular mutation is easier to predict from imaging patterns compared to the others? How might the other mutation categories be improved with more data or a better model?
