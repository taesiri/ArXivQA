# [Turning Dust into Gold: Distilling Complex Reasoning Capabilities from   LLMs by Leveraging Negative Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show strong reasoning capabilities, but their large size makes deployment difficult. 
- Prior work has tried distilling reasoning skills from LLMs into smaller models using chain-of-thought reasoning paths. However, they only use positive samples and discard negative ones with incorrect answers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a framework to distill knowledge from both positive and negative samples from the LLM. 
- It consists of 3 main steps:
   1. Negative Assistant Training: Train a separate model on negative samples and use attention to selectively integrate its knowledge when training on positive samples.
   2. Negative Calibrated Enhancement: Use the negative model as a baseline to highlight critical knowledge when doing self-distillation on the positive model.  
   3. Adaptive Self-Consistency: Train a ranking model on positive/negative samples to score multiple candidate answers and more accurately select the final answer.

Main Contributions:  
- Show the value of negative samples for distilling reasoning skills, which is overlooked in prior work
- Propose a comprehensive framework with 3 complementary steps to effectively exploit knowledge from both positive and negative LLM samples
- Extensive experiments on math reasoning datasets demonstrate significant gains over baselines by leveraging negative information

In summary, the key idea is to fully utilize the knowledge and behaviors from both correct and incorrect LLM outputs to better transfer reasoning capabilities to smaller models across training and inference. Both positive and negative views are important for distillation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a model specialization framework to effectively distill complex reasoning abilities from large language models into small models by leveraging both positive and negative training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It illustrates that negative samples with incorrect answers can also provide valuable resources besides positive data for distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) in complex arithmetic reasoning tasks. 

2) It proposes a model specialization framework consisting of three progressive steps (negative assistant training, negative calibrated enhancement, and adaptive self-consistency) that span from the training stage to the inference stage to fully leverage negative data to enhance distilling reasoning abilities from LLMs.

3) It demonstrates through extensive experiments on challenging arithmetic reasoning datasets that the proposed framework can effectively exploit negative information and outperform baselines by a large margin in distilling reasoning capabilities from LLMs to smaller models.

In summary, the key contribution is leveraging negative data in addition to positive data at all stages of the model specialization process to more effectively transfer reasoning abilities from large models to small specialized ones. The proposed methods allow negative data to provide complementary knowledge to positive data for enhanced distillation of reasoning skills.

The paper focuses on distilling complex reasoning abilities from large language models into specialized small models, using both positive and negative training data. Key ideas include leveraging negative samples through a dual LoRA structure and corrected attention mechanism (NAT), using negative outputs as a baseline to calibrate distillation (NCE), and weighting candidate outputs adaptively based on a ranking model (ASC). The goal is to fully exploit negative information to improve model specialization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using negative samples besides positive ones for distilling knowledge from large language models. What are some ways the framework could be extended to utilize other forms of additional data, like unlabeled or weakly labeled data?

2. The negative assistant training module uses dual LoRA structures and an attention mechanism for integrating knowledge. What are some alternative model architectures or techniques that could be explored? 

3. The negative calibrated enhancement module uses KL divergence between the positive and negative models. What other metrics could capture crucial differences in reasoning between the models?

4. For the adaptive self-consistency module's ranking model, what other training formulations, loss functions, or model architectures may improve performance?

5. How robust is the overall framework to changes in the student model architecture? Could the techniques transfer to non-transformer models?

6. The paper focuses on arithmetic reasoning tasks. How well could the techniques apply to other complex reasoning domains like commonsense reasoning? 

7. What theoretical justifications support the use of negative data? Can insights from learning theory or curriculum learning explain the benefits?  

8. How efficiently can the framework scale to even larger teacher/student models or dataset sizes? Are there optimizations like distillation cascades that could help?

9. How sensitive are the results to the quantity and quality of the negative demonstrations obtained from the teacher model?

10. The framework improves accuracy but may have tradeoffs on other metrics like model size or inference latency. How could these tradeoffs be quantified and optimized?
