## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to develop an efficient scheme for accelerating N:M sparse DNN training on FPGA using co-design of algorithm, architecture and dataflow?

The key points are:

- N:M sparsity is a promising technique to reduce computational cost of DNN training while maintaining accuracy. However, its potential has not been fully exploited in training acceleration.

- There is a lack of dedicated hardware supporting efficient N:M sparse operations for training acceleration. 

- Algorithm, architecture and dataflow co-design is required to fully unleash the power of N:M sparsity and develop an efficient acceleration solution. 

Specifically, the paper proposes:

- A bidirectional weight pruning algorithm (BDWP) to exploit N:M sparsity in both forward and backward passes of training.

- A sparse training accelerator (SAT) with unified processing elements to support both dense and N:M sparse operations.

- Dataflow optimizations like interleave mapping and offline scheduling to further boost efficiency.

Through co-design of these techniques, the paper aims to develop an efficient FPGA-based scheme to accelerate N:M sparse DNN training with higher throughput and energy efficiency compared to prior arts.

In summary, the core research question is how to effectively exploit N:M sparsity to accelerate DNN training on FPGA through co-optimization across algorithm, architecture and dataflow aspects. The proposed techniques address the challenges and inefficiencies of prior works.
