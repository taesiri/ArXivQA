# [Cross-Domain Self-supervised Multi-task Feature Learning using Synthetic   Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that learning visual representations from multiple complementary synthetic image modeling tasks and adapting them to real images via adversarial training can produce features that are useful for real-world vision tasks. Specifically, the key claims are:- Training a model on multiple related tasks (surface normal, depth, and contour prediction) encourages it to learn more general features compared to training on a single task.- Using synthetic data provides unlimited training examples with free ground truth annotations for these multiple tasks.- Adapting the learned features from synthetic to real images via adversarial domain adaptation makes the features more transferable to real-world vision tasks.The main goal is to show that the proposed multi-task learning approach on synthetic data combined with unsupervised domain adaptation can learn visual features that are competitive or better than existing self-supervised approaches on transfer learning benchmarks like PASCAL VOC classification/detection and ImageNet classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a novel self-supervised multi-task feature learning network that learns generalizable high-level visual representations from synthetic imagery. The key points are:- They propose a network that jointly learns multiple self-supervised tasks on synthetic data - predicting depth, surface normal, and instance contours. Learning these complementary tasks forces the network to learn more general features.- They use an unsupervised domain adaptation technique to minimize the gap between features learned on synthetic vs real images. This involves adversarial training to make synthetic features look like real features.- Through experiments on PASCAL VOC and ImageNet, they demonstrate their learned features transfer well to real image classification and detection tasks, outperforming single-task baselines.In summary, the main novelty is using synthetic imagery and its free annotations (depth, surface normal, contours) to train a multi-task self-supervised feature learning network. The multi-task learning and unsupervised domain adaptation allow it to learn features that transfer to real image tasks, despite being trained only on synthetic data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel self-supervised deep network that learns generalizable visual representations by jointly predicting the surface normal, depth, and instance contours of synthetic images while adapting the learned features to real images using adversarial training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in self-supervised visual representation learning:- Uses synthetic imagery rather than real-world images for pre-training. Most prior work in this area uses large unlabeled image datasets like ImageNet or video datasets like Sports-1M for pre-training. Using synthetic data is a relatively new idea that avoids the need for collecting and labeling a large real image dataset.- Learns multiple pre-training tasks jointly. Many prior works focus on a single pre-text task like colorization, jigsaw puzzle solving, etc. Learning multiple complementary tasks could allow the model to learn more robust and generalizable features.- Performs domain adaptation from synthetic to real. Since the model is pre-trained on synthetic images, adapting the learned features to align better with real image distributions is critical. The domain adaptation aspect is unique to learning from synthetic data.- Achieves strong performance on transfer learning benchmarks like PASCAL VOC and competitive results on ImageNet classification compared to prior state-of-the-art self-supervised methods that use real image datasets. This suggests synthetic data can be a viable alternative to real data for pre-training visual features.- Uses a relatively simple model architecture built off AlexNet, compared to some recent self-supervised methods that use more complex designs. The strong results indicate that the multi-task learning paradigm is effective.In summary, this paper presents a novel approach for self-supervised learning that uses synthetic imagery and domain adaptation. The results demonstrate the potential of this idea as an alternative to using unlabeled real image datasets. The multi-task learning framework is shown to learn useful transferable features competitive with other state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions based on this work:- Expanding the approach to more tasks beyond depth, surface normal, and instance contours. They mention semantic segmentation as one possibility. Adding more complementary tasks could potentially help the model learn even more generalizable representations.- Exploring different domain adaptation techniques to further close the gap between synthetic and real image features. The authors used a simple feature-level adversarial domain adaptation approach, but more advanced techniques could help improve transferrability. - Using more diverse and complex synthetic datasets beyond just indoor scenes. This could help the model learn features that are useful for recognizing a wider variety of objects and scenes. The authors mention virtual outdoor environments as one possibility.- Scaling up the model and data size even further. The results showed that going from 0.5M to 1.5M synthetic images improved performance, indicating that collecting more diverse synthetic data and training larger models could further help.- Developing better evaluation protocols and benchmarks for self-supervised representation learning. This is a general issue for the field to standardize how different methods are compared.In summary, the main future directions are expanding the tasks, improving the domain adaptation, using more varied synthetic data, scaling up the data and model size, and developing better evaluation benchmarks. Advancing these could help push self-supervised representation learning using synthetic data even further.
