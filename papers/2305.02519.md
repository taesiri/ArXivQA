## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we build a large-scale video question answering benchmark that supports fine-grained compositional reasoning over untrimmed videos? 

The key points are:

- Existing video QA benchmarks have limitations in generating fine-grained questions that require reasoning about detailed video semantics. 

- The authors introduce ANetQA, a new benchmark built on top of ActivityNet videos, to address this limitation.

- The key features of ANetQA are:

1) Untrimmed long videos with rich semantics 

2) Fine-grained spatio-temporal scene graph annotations

3) Massive and diverse QA pairs generated from fine-grained templates

4) Benchmark size is an order of magnitude larger than previous ones

- Experiments show current QA models are far from human performance, indicating challenge of ANetQA and room for improvement.

In summary, the main research question is how to build a large-scale video QA benchmark that can effectively evaluate fine-grained compositional reasoning, which ANetQA aims to address through its design and scale.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces ANetQA, a new large-scale video question answering benchmark built on top of fine-grained video scene graph annotations from ActivityNet to enable compositional reasoning over complex untrimmed web videos.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper introduces a new VideoQA benchmark ANetQA for fine-grained compositional reasoning over untrimmed web videos. Other major VideoQA benchmarks use either synthetic videos (e.g. CLEVRER, MarioQA) or simpler real-world videos (e.g. MovieQA, TVQA, ActivityNet-QA). ANetQA uses more complex videos from ActivityNet.

- The QA pairs in ANetQA are automatically generated from spatio-temporal scene graphs annotated by humans. This is similar to the recent AGQA benchmark, but ANetQA uses more fine-grained scene graph annotations with additional attributes. 

- With 1.4B QA pairs, ANetQA is orders of magnitude larger than previous real-world VideoQA benchmarks like MovieQA (150K QA pairs) and ActivityNet-QA (58K QA pairs). The only larger benchmark is the synthetic HowTo100M.

- ANetQA claims to have better control over language biases compared to benchmarks that rely on captions or free-form human-generated questions. The scene graph based automatic QA generation helps reduce biases.

- The paper presents comprehensive experiments and analysis of several state-of-the-art VideoQA models on ANetQA. Performance is significantly lower compared to other benchmarks, showing ANetQA is more challenging.

- The best model obtains 44.5% accuracy on ANetQA while human performance is 84.5%, indicating significant room for improvement. Other benchmarks like ActivityNet-QA have smaller human-model gaps.

In summary, ANetQA pushes VideoQA to more complex real-world videos and fine-grained reasoning compared to prior benchmarks, while utilizing scene graphs and automatic QA generation to provide control and scale. The large performance gap shows it poses new challenges to current models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Reducing the language biases and answer ambiguities further in the benchmark. The authors mention continuing to improve the quality of the scene graphs and generated QA pairs.

- Introducing more question types to measure additional reasoning skills. Specifically, the authors mention scene-text understanding and causality inference as potentially interesting skills to evaluate.

- Exploring different strategies for representing the scene graph statistics and incorporating that information to improve model performance. The authors experimented with a simple word frequency-based approach but suggest more advanced scene graph encodings could help.

- Evaluating the transferability of models trained on this benchmark to other VideoQA datasets. The authors develop ANetQA using videos from ActivityNet so testing generalization is important.

- Developing new model architectures or self-supervised pretraining strategies to improve reasoning on this benchmark. The authors see the gap between current models and human performance as an opportunity for impactful innovation.

In summary, the main suggested directions are improving the benchmark itself, expanding the skills tested, leveraging the scene graphs better, evaluating generalization, and driving progress on long-standing VideoQA challenges that ANetQA exposes.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents ANetQA, a new video question answering benchmark for measuring fine-grained compositional reasoning abilities over real-world videos. ANetQA is built on top of untrimmed videos from ActivityNet and consists of automatically generated question-answer pairs based on annotated video scene graphs. The key strengths of ANetQA compared to previous benchmarks like AGQA are: (1) The use of long, untrimmed videos containing richer semantics and multiple scenarios; (2) More fine-grained scene graph annotations including objects, relationships, attributes, and actions; (3) The ability to generate more diverse questions requiring detailed reasoning due to the fine-grained nature of the scene graphs. In total, ANetQA contains 1.4 billion unbalanced and 13.4 million balanced QA pairs, making it an order of magnitude larger than previous benchmarks. 

The paper provides comprehensive experiments and analysis of several state-of-the-art video QA models on ANetQA, including hierarchical, Transformer, and video-language pretrained models. The best performing model achieves 44.5% accuracy compared to 84.5% for human performance, indicating significant room for improvement on this challenging benchmark. Detailed breakdowns are provided analyzing model capabilities on different question structures, semantics, reasoning skills, and answer types. The paper also studies the impact of different auxiliary annotations like scene graph statistics and oracle frames on improving model performance. Overall, the paper makes a strong case that ANetQA represents the most comprehensive and challenging video QA benchmark to date requiring detailed compositional reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces ANetQA, a new video question answering benchmark built on top of real-world videos from ActivityNet. Similar to the recent AGQA benchmark, ANetQA takes a two-stage approach - first annotating videos with fine-grained spatio-temporal scene graphs containing objects, relationships, attributes and actions, and then automatically generating a large number of diverse question-answer pairs by composing elements from the scene graphs. The key difference from AGQA is that ANetQA contains more detailed annotations, allowing the generation of compositional questions that require finer-grained reasoning abilities. The annotated scene graphs have richer taxonomies of objects, relationships and attributes compared to AGQA, as well as natural language descriptions of actions. Based on these, the authors design 119 templates to generate a massive set of 1.4 billion QA pairs, which are balanced to 13.4 million QA pairs covering various reasoning skills. Experiments show state-of-the-art models are still far below human performance, demonstrating the challenge and usefulness of the benchmark.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a new benchmark called ANetQA for fine-grained compositional reasoning over untrimmed videos from ActivityNet. The key problem it is trying to address is the limitations of existing video QA benchmarks in measuring diverse reasoning abilities with fine-grained control. Specifically, it argues that previous benchmarks:

- Use simple/non-compositional questions and suffer from language biases, making it hard to diagnose model weaknesses. 

- Use synthetic videos which lack diversity and don't generalize to real videos.

- Rely on video captions or free-form human annotations which lead to simple questions and answer distribution biases.

To address these issues, ANetQA introduces a new benchmark that:

- Uses real-world untrimmed videos with rich semantics from ActivityNet.

- Annotates fine-grained spatio-temporal scene graphs for the videos.

- Automatically generates a massive number of compositional QA pairs from templates using the scene graphs.

So in summary, the key problem is limitations of previous video QA benchmarks, and ANetQA introduces a new benchmark to enable finer-grained compositional reasoning measurement over real-world videos.
