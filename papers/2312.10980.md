# [Liquid Leak Detection Using Thermal Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10980)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a system to detect liquid leaks using thermal images in the oil and gas industry. The key problem is that liquid leaks in pipelines, pumps and tanks can cause severe environmental and financial damage. The proposed solution leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models named YOLOv8 and RT DETR for real-time detection of liquid leaks. 

The methodology uses an industry dataset of thermal images which are pre-processed and augmented to enhance the quality and diversity of the data. This dataset is then split into training, validation and test sets. The core of the system is training YOLOv8 and RT DETR models on the dataset to recognize signatures of liquid leaks in thermal images. Key metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), precision and recall are used to evaluate and compare the performance of both models.

The YOLOv8 model builds on the YOLO family with an anchor-free design and improved backbone network to enable accurate leak detection. Results show YOLOv8 achieves impressive performance with 96% mAP, 90.8% precision and 89.9% recall. The RT DETR model leverages transformers and attention mechanisms for discerning nuanced features in thermal images. However, its performance is slightly lower than YOLOv8.  

In summary, the paper proposes an automated system integrating YOLOv8 and RT DETR models to reliably detect liquid leaks using thermal images. The models are trained and evaluated on real industry data. Comparative analysis shows YOLOv8 outperforms RT DETR in accurately locating fluid leaks in this application. The solution enables early leak detection to mitigate risks and losses in the oil and gas sector.
