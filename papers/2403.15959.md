# [Risk-Calibrated Human-Robot Interaction via Set-Valued Intent Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Risk-Calibrated Human-Robot Interaction via Set-Valued Intent Prediction":

Problem:
- Tasks where robots must cooperate with humans (e.g. navigating cluttered environments, sorting items) are challenging because there are many valid actions but some may be unsafe due to uncertainty in human intent. 
- Recently, deep learning models for human intent prediction have shown promise but can be overconfident and wrong.
- The key challenges are: (1) statistically guaranteeing safety levels specified by the user, and (2) minimizing requests for human clarification to enable flexible autonomy. 

Proposed Solution: Risk-Calibrated Interactive Planning (RCIP)
- Uses set-valued prediction: generates set of possible human intents based on confidence scores from predictor model. 
- For each predicted intent, plans optimal robot actions. Robot asks for human clarification when action set is not a singleton.
- Calibrates model hyperparameters on small dataset to provide statistical guarantee on risk levels set by user.
- Considers multiple risks like probability of failure and requests for help. Controls risks simultaneously.

Key Contributions:
1) Shows how to use statistical risk control to choose model hyperparameters that provably meet user-specified risk thresholds. Enables flexible autonomy levels.
2) Provides theoretical guarantees for controlling multiple risks in both single-step and multi-step planning problems. 
3) Evaluates RCIP in simulation and hardware for tasks like navigation, manipulation. RCIP reduces human help requests by 5-30% compared to baselines while meeting risk criteria.

In summary, RCIP introduces a method for statistically balancing safety and autonomy in human-robot interaction by set-valued prediction of intent and multi-risk calibration. Experiments validate improved flexibility and safety over existing methods.
