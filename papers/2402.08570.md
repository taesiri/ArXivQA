# [Online Foundation Model Selection in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Online Foundation Model Selection in Robotics":

Problem:
- Foundation models (FMs), which excel in computer vision and natural language processing, are being adopted in robotics. Some FMs are open-source while others are closed-source, requiring payment for access. Users with access to both face a "model selection problem" of deciding between the free but less powerful open-source FMs and the more capable but costly closed-source options. 
- Supervised learning methods to solve this require extensive training data from closed-source FMs, which is expensive. Hence the authors focus on an online learning setting to eliminate this data collection burden.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors formulate an "online model selection problem" aiming to select the best FM from a set of open-source and closed-source options to maximize reward based on model performance, execution time, and monetary cost.
- They propose a solution combining an open-source encoder (e.g. CLIP) to extract contextual features from the data and an online learning algorithm (e.g. PPO) that selects FMs based on this context to maximize reward.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the online model selection problem for selecting between open-source and closed-source FMs
- A solution combining an open-source encoder for feature extraction and contextual online learning for FM selection based on those features
- Theoretical analysis showing contextual algorithms outperform non-contextual ones and characterizing the impact of latency/cost penalties
- Experiments on question answering, autonomous driving, household robotics, and real robot datasets demonstrating up to 14% task success rate improvement over non-contextual methods

The main insight is to leverage a pre-trained open-source encoder to extract data features that accelerate online learning for FM selection, avoiding the need for extensive closed-source FM training data. This allows efficiently exploring capabilities of available FMs to maximize user reward.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a pipeline that combines an open-source encoder and an online learning algorithm to efficiently select between a local open-source foundation model and remote closed-source models for robotic tasks based on context derived from user data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

Formulating the model selection problem with closed-source models as an online model selection problem, and proposing a novel solution to this problem that combines an open-source encoder and a contextual online learning algorithm. Specifically, the paper:

1) Formulates the model selection problem with inaccessible closed-source models as an online learning problem to maximize long-term rewards.

2) Proposes a solution that uses an open-source encoder to extract features from the data to serve as context, and a contextual online learning algorithm that learns to select between a local open-source model and remote closed-source models based on this context. 

3) Provides theoretical analysis showing the superiority of contextual algorithms over non-contextual ones for this problem.

4) Validates the proposed pipeline on multiple datasets, including language-based robotics tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate compared to non-contextual methods.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and data-driven approach to select between open-source and closed-source models in an online setting by using context extracted from limited data.

The paper focuses on the problem of selecting between open-source and closed-source foundation models for robotic tasks based on natural language and visual inputs. It formulates this as a contextual online learning problem where a model selection algorithm aims to maximize rewards related to model performance, execution time, and costs. The proposed solution uses a pre-trained open-source encoder to extract feature representations of the multi-modal context, and then applies a reinforcement learning algorithm like PPO to select models. Experiments are conducted on datasets like ALFRED, Waymo, and Open X-Embodiment. So the key terms cover contextual learning, model selection, robotics, foundation models, encoders, rewards, and the specific datasets used.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using an open-source encoder to extract features from the input data. How does leveraging a pre-trained encoder help accelerate the learning process for the online model selection algorithm? What are the key benefits it provides over training an encoder from scratch?

2. The paper formulates a composite reward function that incorporates model performance, execution time, and monetary costs. How do the weights $\alpha_{\tau}$ and $\alpha_{\price}$ affect the trade-off between selecting local versus remote models? Under what conditions will the algorithm always select the local or always select the remote model?

3. The paper shows theoretically that contextual algorithms outperform non-contextual ones for this problem. Intuitively, why do contextual algorithms have this advantage? What specifically allows them to achieve better cumulative mean rewards?

4. The method relies on the encoder clustering similar data points together. How does the clustering quality of the encoder impact the performance of the overall method? What properties should the ideal encoder clustering have?

5. The paper uses PPO as the online learning algorithm. What are the key advantages of PPO that make it suitable for this problem compared to other on-policy RL algorithms? Would off-policy RL algorithms be appropriate?

6. How does the online model selection problem formulation differ from traditional contextual bandits problems studied in literature? What modifications need to be made for algorithms designed for compact contextual bandit settings to work in this problem?

7. The paper considers adding new models over time. How can the method adapt when new models are added without requiring full retraining? What strategies allow for seamless integration of new models?

8. What metrics beyond cumulative mean reward could be used to evaluate the performance of the online model selection algorithm? What are some weaknesses of using the cumulative mean reward as the sole evaluation metric?  

9. The method is applied to a diverse set of tasks in language, vision, and robotics. How well would it generalize to other applications in science, engineering, etc. that lack such multi-modal features?

10. What theoretical guarantees would provide greater confidence in the solution quality of this heuristic approach? What barriers exist to establishing theoretical performance guarantees for this method?
