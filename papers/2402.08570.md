# [Online Foundation Model Selection in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Online Foundation Model Selection in Robotics":

Problem:
- Foundation models (FMs), which excel in computer vision and natural language processing, are being adopted in robotics. Some FMs are open-source while others are closed-source, requiring payment for access. Users with access to both face a "model selection problem" of deciding between the free but less powerful open-source FMs and the more capable but costly closed-source options. 
- Supervised learning methods to solve this require extensive training data from closed-source FMs, which is expensive. Hence the authors focus on an online learning setting to eliminate this data collection burden.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors formulate an "online model selection problem" aiming to select the best FM from a set of open-source and closed-source options to maximize reward based on model performance, execution time, and monetary cost.
- They propose a solution combining an open-source encoder (e.g. CLIP) to extract contextual features from the data and an online learning algorithm (e.g. PPO) that selects FMs based on this context to maximize reward.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the online model selection problem for selecting between open-source and closed-source FMs
- A solution combining an open-source encoder for feature extraction and contextual online learning for FM selection based on those features
- Theoretical analysis showing contextual algorithms outperform non-contextual ones and characterizing the impact of latency/cost penalties
- Experiments on question answering, autonomous driving, household robotics, and real robot datasets demonstrating up to 14% task success rate improvement over non-contextual methods

The main insight is to leverage a pre-trained open-source encoder to extract data features that accelerate online learning for FM selection, avoiding the need for extensive closed-source FM training data. This allows efficiently exploring capabilities of available FMs to maximize user reward.
