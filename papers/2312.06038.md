# [Correcting Diffusion Generation through Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion models can generate high-quality images but still suffer from two key issues:
1) Missing object errors in text-to-image generation - objects mentioned in the text caption are sometimes missing from the generated image.  
2) Low image quality like artifacts and distortions.

These issues arise because of distributional discrepancies between real and generated images due to limitations of the diffusion model. Existing methods fail to effectively address these issues as they do not aim to minimize the distribution gap.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a particle filtering framework to approximate sampling from the true data distribution using external guidance (a small set of real images and an object detector), in order to reduce the distribution gap and address the above issues simultaneously.  

The key ideas are:
1) Design a resampling weight to modify the output distribution at each diffusion timestep, based on the likelihood ratio between true and model distributions. This allows explicitly approaching the true distribution.
2) Estimate the likelihood ratio using an unconditional discriminator (for image quality issue) and object detector (for missing object issue).   

Contributions:
- First framework to leverage both discriminator and object detector guidance in diffusion particle filtering to address multiple generation issues.
- Significantly outperforms specialized text-to-image baselines in faithfulness and quality on existing benchmarks.
- Achieves state-of-the-art image quality on unconditional and conditional image generation benchmarks.
- Provides in-depth analysis and ablation studies on design choices like timing of resampling, noise levels etc.

The summary covers the key problem and solutions in the paper, the main ideas of the proposed particle filtering framework, competitive results over strong baselines, ablation studies, and highlights the main contributions.
