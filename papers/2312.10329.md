# [Perturbation-Invariant Adversarial Training for Neural Ranking Models:   Improving the Effectiveness-Robustness Trade-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10329)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural ranking models (NRMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like word substitution attacks that add imperceptible perturbations to documents to manipulate rankings. This affects reliability of NRMs.  
- Existing defense methods like adversarial training improve robustness but reduce effectiveness on clean data, creating a trade-off between effectiveness and robustness.

Key Contributions:

1) Theoretical characterization of effectiveness-robustness trade-off:
- Decomposed robust ranking error into natural ranking error (for effectiveness) and boundary ranking error (for robustness).
- Defined perturbation invariance of a ranking model. Proved it is a tight upper bound on boundary ranking error.
- Showed optimizing the two errors pose different objectives leading to the trade-off.

2) Proposed perturbation-invariant adversarial training (PIAT) method:  
- Uses a regularized loss with two terms: natural ranking loss to maximize effectiveness, and adversarial ranking loss to minimize boundary error.
- Adversarial loss encourages smoothness between rankings on clean and attacked data.
- Implemented using KL divergence, ListNet and ListMLE losses.

3) Evaluation on passage ranking dataset:
- PIAT achieves better trade-off than baselines like standard training, data augmentation and adversarial training.
- Ablations show ListNet and ListMLE variants of PIAT outperform KL divergence.
- Visualizations demonstrate PIAT learns robust decision boundaries.

Key impact:
- First theoretical analysis of effectiveness-robustness trade-off for neural ranking models.
- New defense method PIAT yields improved trade-off over state-of-the-art defenses.
- Provides insights to build reliable NRMs and inspire more research on this topic.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a perturbation-invariant adversarial training method to improve the trade-off between effectiveness and robustness for neural ranking models against word substitution attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It provides a theoretical characterization of the trade-off between effectiveness (performance on clean data) and robustness (performance on adversarial data) for neural ranking models by decomposing the robust ranking error into two components - the natural ranking error and the boundary ranking error. 

2. It introduces the concept of "perturbation invariance" of a ranking model, proving it to be a tight upper bound on the boundary ranking error. This measure is used to guide the design of a defense method.

3. It proposes a novel perturbation-invariant adversarial training (PIAT) method to achieve a better trade-off between effectiveness and robustness. PIAT uses a regularized loss function with two terms - a natural ranking loss for effectiveness and an adversarial ranking loss for robustness. Three variants of the adversarial loss are explored.

4. Extensive experiments show PIAT can defend against word substitution attacks while maintaining or even improving ranking effectiveness compared to baselines like standard training, data augmentation and vanilla adversarial training.

In summary, the main contribution is the theoretical analysis to characterize the effectiveness-robustness trade-off and the proposal of PIAT guided by this analysis to achieve superior defense performance.

The paper analyzes the trade-off between effectiveness and robustness for neural ranking models. It introduces concepts like natural ranking error and boundary ranking error to characterize this trade-off. It then proposes a perturbation-invariant adversarial training method called PIAT to improve NRMs' robustness against word substitution attacks while maintaining effectiveness. PIAT uses a regularized loss with both a natural ranking loss term and an adversarial ranking loss term to optimize the trade-off. The key terms and concepts relate to analyzing and improving NRMs' effectiveness-robustness trade-off.
