# [VADv2: End-to-End Vectorized Autonomous Driving via Probabilistic   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13243)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning a human-like driving policy from demonstrations is promising, but the uncertainty and non-deterministic nature of planning makes it challenging. Existing deterministic planning methods cannot effectively model such uncertainty. They tend to output the dominant trajectory, resulting in unsafe or undesirable planning performance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a probabilistic planning approach called VADv2 to address the uncertainty in planning. The key ideas are:

(1) Model the planning policy as an environment-conditioned stochastic process p(a|o), where o is the observations and a is the action. Approximate p(a|o) from large-scale demonstrations.

(2) Discretize the continuous action space into a large planning vocabulary. Use a probabilistic field function to map from the action space to the probability distribution. 

(3) At each timestep, sample an action from the predicted distribution to control the vehicle.

Main Contributions:

(1) Propose probabilistic planning to model uncertainty in planning and learn the distribution of actions from demonstrations.

(2) Present VADv2, an end-to-end driving model based on the probabilistic planning. It takes surround-view images as input, predicts action distribution, and samples actions for control.

(3) Achieve SOTA closed-loop driving performance on CARLA benchmark among vision-based methods. VADv2 runs stably without map or rule-based wrappers.

In summary, the paper addresses the uncertainty problem in learning-based planning by proposing a probabilistic planning approach. The presented model VADv2 achieves promising driving capability.
