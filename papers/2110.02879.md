# [Nested Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02879)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can a nested Q-learning algorithm called Nested Policy Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQI) learn good policies for environments with nested structure, where there are two groups that share some structure but also have distinct dynamics? 2. How does NFQI compare to regular Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) and other baseline methods like transfer learning in terms of performance in these nested environments?3. Can NFQI yield interpretable policies that rely on relevant state features? 4. Is NFQI robust to sample size imbalance between the groups?5. When there is no real group structure in the environment, does NFQI gracefully revert back to regular FQI?The key idea seems to be developing a reinforcement learning approach that can learn optimal policies for two related but distinct groups/environments, while sharing strength between them and accounting for differences. The experiments aim to validate whether NFQI can achieve this versus baseline approaches.In summary, the main hypothesis appears to be that NFQI can learn better performing and more interpretable policies compared to regular Q-learning methods in environments exhibiting a specific nested structure between groups. The experiments aim to demonstrate and validate this central premise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Nested Policy Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQI). This extends standard FQI to account for nested environments that have predefined background and foreground groups with different dynamics but a shared reward function. 2. A two-stage training procedure for NFQI inspired by transfer learning. In the first stage, shared model parameters are trained on all data. In the second stage, foreground-specific parameters are trained only on foreground data.3. Demonstrating that NFQI can learn performant policies that rely on relevant features, handle sample size imbalance between background and foreground groups, and reduce to standard FQI when there is no meaningful group structure. This is shown through experiments on a simulated Cartpole environment and a clinical decision task using real electronic health records.4. Providing a general framework for reinforcement learning in nested environments that is model agnostic. The NFQI framework can incorporate different function classes like neural networks and random forests to approximate the Q-function.In summary, the main contribution seems to be the proposal of NFQI as a novel RL algorithm suited for problems with nested structure between environments/groups, along with empirical demonstrations of its desirable properties. The method allows learning distinct but related policies by sharing strength across groups.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it relates to other research in the field:The paper introduces a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Nested Policy Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQI) for learning optimal policies in environments with nested structure (i.e. two groups that share some characteristics but have different dynamics). The key contributions in relation to other work are:- It extends standard off-policy RL algorithms like Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) to handle nested environments by modeling both groups concurrently with a nested Q-function. This allows it to learn distinct policies suited to each group while exploiting their shared structure. Most prior off-policy RL research focuses on learning a single optimal policy.- The two-stage training procedure is inspired by transfer learning approaches to account for sample size imbalance between groups. However, standard transfer learning methods don't formally incorporate group structure. - It demonstrates strong performance compared to baseline algorithms like FQI and transfer learning on both simulated and real-world medical datasets. The learned policies rely on relevant state features and are robust to group size imbalance.- The approach is model-agnostic and could incorporate different function classes like neural networks or Gaussian processes to represent the nested Q-function. Much prior work on multi-task and meta-RL has focused on neural network parameterizations.Overall, the key novelties are explicitly modeling the nested structure during off-policy RL, the model-agnostic training procedure, and experimental results highlighting the benefits on representative tasks. The paper clearly situates these contributions in relation to multi-task RL, meta-RL, and off-policy batch RL. The approach appears to be a promising new technique for handling nested environments in off-policy reinforcement learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring other approaches for the nested Q-value function, such as Gaussian processes, random forests, and other neural network architectures. This could improve the fit to new, larger datasets by increasing the expressiveness of the Q-value approximation. - Extending the nested model to allow for multi-group structure, rather than just two groups. This would involve modifying the structure of the approximating function f to incorporate multiple g_s and g_f components.- Developing interpretability methods to enable NFQI policies to be used as clinical decision-support tools. This would involve generating qualitative justifications for the actions recommended. - Collaborative work with clinicians to assess whether NFQI policies agree with clinical intuition, and to identify how to best communicate NFQI's treatment suggestions. - Modifying NFQI's training procedure to incorporate real-time patient data, moving from pure off-policy learning to a blend of on-policy and off-policy learning.- Applying NFQI to assess fairness of clinical decision making processes by analyzing differences in group-specific policies. - Incorporating contrastive dimension reduction into model-based RL to enable online dimensionality reduction.- Evaluating the performance of NFQI on larger and more complex medical datasets.- Testing NFQI on a more diverse set of simulation environments beyond Cartpole.- Developing theoretical guarantees for the performance of NFQI.In summary, the main suggestions are around improving NFQI's modeling capabilities, enhancing interpretability, collaborating with domain experts, modifying the training procedure, and applying NFQI to new domains and datasets. Evaluating theoretical properties of NFQI is also highlighted as an area for future work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on skimming the paper, it seems the main contribution is introducing a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Nested Policy Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQI). NFQI is designed to find optimal policies in environments with a nested structure, meaning there are two groups of observations/trajectories that come from similar but slightly different environments. The key idea is that NFQI models these two datasets jointly, sharing statistical strength, while still allowing the learned policies for each group to be distinct. Overall, NFQI aims to leverage the shared structure between groups to improve sample efficiency and performance, while accommodating known differences.In one sentence: The paper introduces Nested Policy Fitted Q-Iteration, a new reinforcement learning algorithm that shares statistical strength between groups of trajectories from related environments while still learning distinct policies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces a new reinforcement learning algorithm called nested policy fitted Q-iteration (NFQI) for learning policies in environments with nested structure. The key ideas are:- Many real-world reinforcement learning problems have a nested structure, where there are two groups of environments that share some structure but also have distinct dynamics (e.g. healthy patients vs patients with a chronic disease). - Existing RL algorithms learn a single policy over all environments. But for nested problems, it's better to learn distinct but related policies for each group that exploit their shared structure. - NFQI extends fitted Q-iteration to learn a nested Q-function with both shared and group-specific components. This lets it learn group-specific policies that leverage shared statistical strength.- NFQI is demonstrated on a simulated "nested cartpole" environment and a clinical decision task using real medical data. It matches or improves on regular FQI and transfer learning baselines.- Qualitative evaluations show NFQI relies on relevant features and differences between the groups. It's also robust to group sample size imbalance.In summary, NFQI is a new off-policy RL algorithm that can effectively learn optimal, interpretable policies for environments exhibiting a specific nested structure with distinct groups and limited foreground data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces a new reinforcement learning algorithm called nested policy fitted Q-iteration (NFQI) for learning policies in environments with nested structure. In a nested environment, there are two groups that share some characteristics but have different dynamics. For example, the groups could be patients with and without a certain disease. The key idea is to learn a nested Q-function that models the shared structure between groups using one function, while allowing group-specific structure to be captured with another function. This allows the algorithm to leverage statistical strength across groups while modeling group differences. The authors show that NFQI learns better performing and more interpretable policies compared to standard algorithms like fitted Q-iteration.The paper demonstrates NFQI on a simulated Cartpole balancing task and a clinical decision task using real medical data. For Cartpole, they create nested structure by adding a constant leftward force in one group, requiring a different balancing policy. NFQI learns better policies here, especially when data is imbalanced. On the clinical task of learning potassium repletion policies for ICU patients, NFQI learns clinically valid group-specific differences. Overall, results suggest NFQI can exploit shared structure when learning policies for nested environments like patient groups, while still capturing meaningful group differences. The approach could be useful for many applications involving distinct but related reinforcement learning tasks.
