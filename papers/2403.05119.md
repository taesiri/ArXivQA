# [Estimation of Electronic Band Gap Energy From Material Properties Using   Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Determining the electronic band gap energy of materials is important for assessing their applications in electronic/optoelectronic devices. 
- Traditional methods like density functional theory (DFT) are computationally expensive and inaccurate.
- Existing ML models require preliminary DFT calculations or are tailored for specific materials. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a universal ML model to estimate band gap energy solely from easily obtained material properties without needing preliminary DFT calculations or knowledge of material structure.

Methods:
- Selected features like stoichiometry, volume, density etc. that capture composition and electronic structure information relevant for band gap.
- Dataset has 55,298 samples, split into training (52,534) and test (2,765) sets.
- First baseline architecture: Classify metal vs non-metal, then regress band gap and classify gap type for non-metals.
- Second architecture: Additional clustering of non-metals before regression and classification.

Key Results:
- Metal vs non-metal classifier has AUC of 0.99. 
- Band gap regression has MAE of 0.2496eV for baseline model.
- Gap type classification has AUC of 0.88 for baseline model.
- With clustering, band gap MAE reduces to 0.2321eV and gap type AUC increases.
- Clustered model has better overall score of 0.9336 vs 0.9299 for baseline model.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated feasibility of universal ML model for band gap estimation solely from basic material properties, without needing preliminary DFT calculations.
- Introduced clustering of dataset to improve regression and classification performance.
- Defined new evaluation metric combining regression error and classification accuracy.
