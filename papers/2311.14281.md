# [Multi-modal Instance Refinement for Cross-domain Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14281)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a Multi-modal Instance Refinement (MMIR) method to alleviate negative transfer in unsupervised cross-domain action recognition. It adopts a two-stream 3D convolutional neural network structure and incorporates deep reinforcement learning agents (S-agent and T-agent) to refine less relevant source instances and ambiguous target instances respectively. Specifically, the agents are trained with deep Q-learning to select outlier action segments within each modality (RGB and optical flow) by treating the I3D feature vectors as states and segment indices as actions. Rewards are provided based on the domain prediction and relevance measure of selected segments. After instance refinement, the adversarial feature alignment is realized by optimizing the domain classifiers with refined segments using gradient reversal layer. Experiments conducted on EPIC-Kitchens dataset demonstrate that MMIR successfully addresses negative transfer and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain action recognition. Ablation studies also validate the contribution of reinforcement learning agents and instance refinement strategy.
