# [Information theory for model reduction in stochastic dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops an information-theoretic framework for model reduction in dynamical systems. The goal is to identify a small set of "relevant variables" that retain maximum predictive power about a system's future state. This is formalized as a lossy compression problem called the information bottleneck (IB), which balances retaining information about the current state versus the future state. A key analytical result is that the optimal compression at high levels of compression (fewer relevant variables) corresponds directly to the leading eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamical system's evolution. Practically, the authors implement the IB optimization using neural networks, allowing application to complex high-dimensional systems. The interpretability of the learned neural network encodings as dynamical eigenfunctions is demonstrated on several chaotic systems. The method requires no feature engineering or physical intuition about "slow variables", instead deriving these automatically from data in an information-theoretically optimal way. Examples include a Hopf oscillator, the Lorenz system, and experimental fluid flows where slow coherent structures are identified from raw video footage found on YouTube.
