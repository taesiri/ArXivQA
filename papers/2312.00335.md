# [Learning Anatomically Consistent Embedding for Chest Radiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00335)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) approach called PEAC (Patch Embedding of Anatomical Consistency) that is designed to enhance the consistency in learning visual representations of anatomical structures in medical images. PEAC has an architecture of student-teacher, taking two global crops from a chest X-ray with overlaps to learn global consistency between the crops and local consistency between corresponding local patches in the overlapped region. The student module, built on POPAR, learns high-level anatomical relationships and fine-grained image features. Integrating the teacher aims to learn consistent contextualized embedding across views for coarse-grained global and fine-grained local anatomical structures. Experiments demonstrate that PEAC outperforms fully-supervised pretrained models on ImageNet and ChestX-ray14 and state-of-the-art SSL methods in classification and segmentation tasks. Visualizations also show PEAC's capability in precisely matching arbitrary anatomical structures across patients of different genders/weights and across views, and accurately co-segmenting anatomical structures in a zero-shot manner, indicating it has learned valid and consistent anatomical embedding.
