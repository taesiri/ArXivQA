## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DriveCoT: Integrating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with End-to-End Driving":

Problem:
Existing end-to-end driving models lack interpretability and controllability due to their black-box nature, hindering real-world deployment. Also, current driving datasets primarily cover normal/safe driving scenarios and provide only single-shot explanations for decisions. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes DriveCoT, the first end-to-end driving dataset containing diverse challenging scenarios (e.g. high-speed, lane changing) and chain-of-thought (CoT) style reasoning labels to indicate the detailed thinking process across driving aspects. It utilizes an expert policy to control the vehicle in CARLA simulator and logs the CoT reasoning process and decisions. 

Additionally, a baseline model termed DriveCoT-Agent is proposed. It takes as input multi-view camera videos and target point, and generates CoT predictions on aspects like collision, traffic light/sign, relation to ahead vehicle. The final decision is derived from the CoT predictions. This enhances interpretability and controllability.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of DriveCoT, the first end-to-end driving dataset with CoT style labels and diverse challenging scenarios 

- Design of a new rule-based expert policy to handle challenging scenarios in CARLA and collect reasoning process labels  

- Proposal of DriveCoT-Agent baseline model that integrates CoT predictions to obtain final decisions, showing strong performance on both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations

In summary, this paper presents DriveCoT dataset and baseline model to stimulate research on interpretable end-to-end driving systems that can handle challenging scenarios. The CoT style labels and expert policy design are key highlights.
