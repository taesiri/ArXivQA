# [AceMap: Knowledge Discovery through Academic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the exponential growth in scientific literature, researchers face challenges in effectively managing and extracting valuable insights from this vast corpus of information. Existing academic search engines fail to capture the interactions between different academic entities like papers, authors, institutions etc that form complex networks reflecting patterns of scientific development. Quantifying and visualizing these networks poses significant difficulties.  

Proposed Solution - AceMap:  
The authors propose AceMap, an academic system for knowledge discovery using graph-based techniques. AceMap has four key capabilities:

1. Construction: Builds a large-scale heterogenous academic knowledge graph with 220 million papers, 103 million authors etc, following a standardized ontology. Uses advanced entity extraction and disambiguation methods.

2. Visualization: Presents a novel algorithm called VSAN to visualize super-large academic networks with millions of nodes in an intuitive galaxy-like structure showing connections between papers, authors, conferences etc.

3. Quantification: Introduces a new metric called Knowledge Quantification Index (KQI) based on graph entropy to measure the knowledge contained in academic entities like papers, authors, institutions. Enables standardized comparison.

4. Analysis: Summarizes the evolution of ideas between papers using citation relationships and concept co-occurrence. Also generates innovative cross-disciplinary text combining machine reading and NLP.

Key Contributions:
1. Construction of a comprehensive scientific knowledge graph, AceKG, with 3.13 billion relationships 
2. Galaxy-like visualization method, VSAN, that scales to networks with millions of nodes
3. Unified knowledge measurement metric, KQI, applicable across heterogeneous academic entities 
4. Machine reading capabilities to trace idea flows and generate innovative concepts

The system aims to help researchers more effectively access, analyze and build upon academic knowledge networks. Next steps include integrating figures/tables, leveraging AI for science, analyzing evolutions of viewpoints over time etc.
