# [Faithful Persona-based Conversational Dataset Generation with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10007)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing persona-based conversational datasets have limitations such as small size, static dialogues, irrelevant utterances, and contradictions between persona attributes and dialogues.  
- It is difficult to update these datasets with new topics and concepts.
- There is a need for methods to generate high-quality, customizable, persona-based conversational datasets at scale.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a 3-level pipeline to generate persona-based conversational datasets:
   1. User Generation: Augment seed personas into expanded, consistent user profiles
   2. User Pairing: Match user profiles as conversation partners 
   3. Conversation Generation: Iteratively generate conversations between user pairs and refine using quality criteria
- The conversation generation uses a Generator-Critic architecture with LLMs:
   - Generator: LLM prompted to output persona-based conversations
   - Critic: Mixture of expert LLMs that evaluate quality and select best samples
- This iterative process gradually improves the generator by using the best samples to fine-tune it.

Contributions:
- Propose an unsupervised approach to generate and extend specialized personas using LLMs
- Introduce a framework to evolve a dataset using LLMs while imposing different objectives
- Release a high-quality persona-based conversational dataset called SPC with 20K conversations  

The key novelty is the ability to generate customizable persona-based datasets at scale in an unsupervised manner while maintaining high quality using the proposed Generator-Critic architecture. The framework is generalizable to other specialized dataset creation tasks.
