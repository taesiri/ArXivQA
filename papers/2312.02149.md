## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method to generate consistent multi-scale image content across different zoom levels, enabling extreme "semantic zooms" into a scene (e.g. from a landscape view to a macro shot). The method takes as input a series of text prompts describing the scene at different scales and generates a multi-scale image representation that can be rendered into a seamless zooming video. A joint multi-scale diffusion sampling approach is used that coordinates parallel sampling processes across scales and consolidates them into a unified "zoom stack" through an iterative frequency-band blending procedure. This allows generating images at each scale that are both plausible on their own and consistent with other scales. The method grounds images at every scale in semantic text prompts, allowing it to conceive new structures across extreme zoom factors, unlike traditional super-resolution methods. Experiments demonstrate the approach generating diverse and consistent zooming videos superior to baseline methods. Applications include controllable semantic zoom creation and zoom videos grounded in real photographs. The method showcases creative control through text prompts to explore scenes at scales ranging from galaxies to skin cells.
