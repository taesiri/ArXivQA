# [Towards Safety and Helpfulness Balanced Responses via Controllable Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) need to balance safety and helpfulness in their responses to provide a good user experience. Overly prioritizing safety leads to unhelpful responses while prioritizing helpfulness risks generating harmful content.
- Finding the right balance is challenging and varies across different use cases. There is a need for methods to control the safety and helpfulness levels in LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new control tokens in the input that specify numeric levels of requested safety and helpfulness. 
- Generate synthetic training data by sampling the LLM's responses on its original training set and scoring them with existing safety and helpfulness reward models.
- Fine-tune the LLM on this self-generated data to unlock controllability over safety and helpfulness.
- Compare training objectives like conditional language modeling, Exponential Maximum Average Treatment Effect (ExMATE), and reinforcement learning. 

Key Contributions:
- Framework to unlock LLM's own controllability over safety and helpfulness without needing additional human annotations.
- Detailed analysis showing safety and helpfulness are not just a tradeoff but have entanglements, highlighting control challenges.   
- Experiments show self-generated data can enable control over safety and helpfulness. ExMATE gives best overall performance.
- Benchmark and metrics to understand and measure control of these attributes in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a self-supervised framework to unlock large language models' controllability over safety and helpfulness attributes without requiring additional human annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces and defines the safety and helpfulness control task in large language models (LLMs). 

2. It proposes a self-supervised fine-tuning framework for LLMs that utilizes only self-generated data from the model and its used reward models to unlock the model's controllability over safety and helpfulness levels.

3. It provides a benchmark and detailed analysis for the introduced safety and helpfulness control task in LLMs. The analysis reveals that safety and helpfulness can be traded off, entangled attributes that are challenging but achievable to control in LLMs.

So in summary, the paper focuses on controlling the safety and helpfulness attributes in LLMs without requiring extra human annotations, proposes methods to achieve this using self-supervision, and analyzes the tradeoffs and challenges involved.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Safety and helpfulness attributes 
- Controlling model responses
- Self-generated data
- Training-free methods like prompting and reranking 
- Fine-tuning methods like conditional language modeling (CLM), Exponential Maximum Average Treatment Effect (ExMATE), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
- Evaluation metrics like micro/macro Pearson correlation, mean absolute error, and binary test
- Tradeoffs between safety and helpfulness
- Disentangling safety and helpfulness attributes
- Unlocking controllability of LLMs without extra human annotations

The paper introduces a framework to control the safety and helpfulness of LLM responses using self-generated data, without needing additional human annotations. It compares training-free and fine-tuning methods, analyzes the challenges around entangled and contradictory safety/helpfulness attributes, and demonstrates that the framework can unlock controllability over these attributes in LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a training-free framework that utilizes self-generation to unlock an LLM's controllability over safety and helpfulness. What are the key components of this framework and how do they work together to enable controllability?

2. The paper introduces control tokens as extra input to specify the requested levels of safety and helpfulness. What format are these control tokens in and what alternative ways of specifying the control levels were explored? How does using numeric control tokens impact model understanding?

3. The paper distills the preliminary self-generated data using the MOEC strategy. What issues does this strategy aim to address with the raw self-generated data? How does retaining extreme cases and quantizing the scores help mitigate these issues? 

4. The paper experiments with different fine-tuning objectives like CLM, ExMATE and RLHF on the distilled data. Can you explain what each of these objectives tries to optimize for and why ExMATE gives the best overall performance?

5. The experiments reveal interesting properties about the relationship between safety and helpfulness attributes, like trade-offs, entanglements and controllability challenges. Can you elaborate on one such property using examples from the paper?  

6. One result indicates that existing safety-optimized models may not have higher potential for safety controllability. What could be some reasons for this counter-intuitive finding? How can it be validated further?

7. The paper uses several evaluation metrics like mP, MP, Err and BT to validate controllability. Can you explain one of these metrics in detail and discuss its effectiveness? Are there any limitations?

8. For helpfulness control, using matched controllable tokens works better than mismatched ones, except for ExMATE. What does this indicate about ExMATE's ability to disentangle attributes? How can this be improved further?

9. The paper demonstrates self-generation data unlocking LLM controllability without extra human annotations. What are some key advantages of this method? How do the results support its effectiveness?

10. The conclusion states that controlling safety and helpfulness is challenging but achievable through this framework. What specific challenges exist and how can they be tackled by extending this work?
