# [Physics-informed neural networks for transformed geometries and   manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15940)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel formulation of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to expand their applicability to complex and varying geometries as well as to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) defined on manifolds. The key idea is to incorporate a geometric transformation that maps a simple reference domain to the actual computational domain while concurrently adjusting the derivative computation in the physics-informed loss function. This allows imposing exact Dirichlet boundary conditions and achieves a latent representation of the solution on the reference domain that generalizes well to similar geometries. The method is showcased on several examples, including solving PDEs like the Eikonal and Poisson equations on manifolds, analyzing fluid flow in a deformed tube geometry, and even enabling shape optimization where the domain geometry itself is represented by a neural network. Through these demonstrative examples spanning manifold cases and domain transformations, the paper shows the enhanced flexibility of the proposed framework over traditional PINNs, unveiling exciting capabilities for solving PDEs on complex geometries and parametrized shapes. The proposed methodology paves the way for advanced scientific computing and engineering applications involving PDEs defined on intricate geometries.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel formulation of physics-informed neural networks using geometric transformations to extend their applicability to complex/varying geometries and manifolds while enabling precise enforcement of boundary conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel formulation of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex and varying geometries, as well as on manifolds. 

The key ideas are:

1) Represent the computational domain via a diffeomorphism (smooth mapping) from a simple reference domain. This allows imposing exact Dirichlet boundary conditions on the reference domain using distance functions.

2) Adapt the computation of derivatives in the PINN loss function to incorporate the geometry transformation. This formulates the PINN solution as a latent representation on the reference domain, enabling better generalization across geometric variations.

3) Demonstrate the approach on several examples, including solving PDEs on manifolds and using a learned transformation for shape optimization/free boundary problems.

So in summary, the main contribution is a methodology to make PINNs more flexible for solving PDEs on complex/varying geometries and manifolds by using a reference domain and adapted derivative computation. This enhances PINN's applicability for problems involving geometric variations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs): Neural networks that incorporate physics principles and partial differential equations into their training process.

- Diffeomorphism: A differentiable function with a differentiable inverse that smoothly maps one domain to another. Used in the paper to transform a reference domain.

- Manifolds: Lower-dimensional structures embedded in higher-dimensional space. The paper shows how PINNs can be applied to solve PDEs defined on manifolds.

- Transformed geometries: The paper proposes a novel PINN formulation that can handle complex or varying geometries by incorporating a geometric transformation.

- Latent representation: The solution on the reference domain provided by the PINN, which changes smoothly under geometric variations.

- Shape optimization: An application shown in the paper where the geometry itself is optimized using a PINN by representing it with a neural network transformation.

- Free boundary problems: Problems where the domain boundary is not fixed but part of the solution. Enabled in the framework through the geometry parameterization.

The key ideas are using transformations and manifold formulations to expand PINNs to handle more complex geometries and boundaries.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel formulation of PINNs using a diffeomorphism mapping from a reference domain. What are the key advantages of this proposed approach over traditional PINNs? How does it help with imposing boundary conditions and enhancing flexibility?

2. The paper demonstrates the method on both manifold cases (where dim(reference domain) < dim(computational domain)) and transformation cases (where dim(reference domain) = dim(computational domain)). What is the key difference in how PINNs are formulated and trained between these two cases?

3. For the manifold case, the paper claims this is the first instance of solving a Poisson equation on a manifold using PINNs. What modifications were needed in the loss function and network architecture to enable this? How does this expand the applicability of PINNs?

4. The paper shows an example of solving a Stokes flow problem in a deformed tube geometry. What are the benefits of obtaining a latent representation of the solution on the reference domain? How can this aid in generalization and operator learning?

5. The paper demonstrates an initial example of shape optimization using the proposed approach. What are the limitations of using a neural network to directly represent the transformation in this context? How can the method be extended to provide guarantees on the transformation? 

6. The proposed method computes derivatives using automatic differentiation through the transformation neural network. What techniques can be used to improve efficiency and enable application to 3D problems?

7. How does the choice of reference domain affect accuracy and training of the method? What criteria should be used for selecting an appropriate reference domain?

8. The method has only been demonstrated on relatively simple geometries and equations. What steps are needed to scale the approach to more complex systems of PDEs and 3D geometries?

9. What types of regularization or constraints need to be imposed on the transformation neural network to ensure it remains a valid diffeomorphism? How can distortion or folding of the mapping be detected and avoided?

10. How can the approach be integrated with existing methods for learning mappings between meshes and latent spaces? Could these geometric embeddings be used directly instead of learning a transformation network?
