# [MoCaE: Mixture of Calibrated Experts Significantly Improves Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14976)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that ensembling different object detectors into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) can significantly improve detection accuracy compared to using individual detectors. 

Specifically, the paper makes the following key claims:

- Naively combining different object detectors into an MoE often does not work well, because the confidence scores of different detectors are not calibrated/compatible with each other.

- Properly calibrating the confidence scores of each detector before combining them into an MoE enables accurate and complementary contributions from each expert. 

- This proposed approach of "Mixture of Calibrated Experts" (MoCaE) leads to significant gains in detection accuracy over individual detectors, demonstrating the benefit of ensembling different types of detectors.

- MoCaE outperforms vanilla deep ensembles, even when using fewer detectors, owing to the diversity of detectors combined.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that calibrating detectors before ensembling them allows creating an effective MoE that surpasses individual detectors and vanilla ensembles. The experiments aim to validate this central idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) as an effective approach to combine different object detectors into an ensemble that outperforms the individual detectors. 

The key ideas are:

1. Identifying that naively combining different object detectors does not work well, as their confidence scores are not calibrated/compatible with each other. 

2. Proposing to first calibrate the confidence scores of each detector before combining them, using methods like isotonic regression. This aligns the confidence scores to represent the IOU of the detections. 

3. After calibration, combine the detections from different detectors using NMS or its variants like Soft-NMS. The calibrated scores allow NMS to select the most accurate detections across the detectors.

4. Showing significant gains on COCO test-dev, LVIS and DOTA datasets by combining just 2-3 different detectors using MoCaE, compared to single detectors and vanilla ensembles. The gains are up to 2.4 AP on COCO, 2.3 AP on LVIS masks and 0.8 AP on DOTA.

5. Demonstrating that MoCaE outperforms deep ensembles even with fewer detectors, as deep ensembles suffer from making correlated errors. MoCaE leverages diversity across detector architectures.

So in summary, the key contribution is identifying calibration as the missing piece to enable accurate detector ensembles, and proposing the simple yet effective MoCaE approach to achieve this. The gains on multiple datasets highlight its effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) to effectively combine different object detectors into an ensemble by first calibrating their confidence scores to a common scale before aggregating their predictions, resulting in significant performance gains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes a new method for combining multiple object detectors into an ensemble (termed Mixture of Calibrated Experts or MoCaE). Ensembling different object detectors is an interesting but relatively underexplored area compared to ensembling classifiers. Most prior work has focused on ensembling the same object detector architecture trained from different initializations (deep ensembles), rather than combining diverse detector architectures. So this explores a novel direction.

- The key innovation proposed is calibrating the confidence scores of each detector before ensembling, in order to make them compatible. Prior work has mainly combined object detectors in a straightforward way without explicitly addressing the incompatible confidence score distributions. The paper convincingly demonstrates that this calibration step is crucial for creating an effective ensemble.

- For the calibration, the paper proposes matching the confidence scores to the IoU of predictions. Using IoU as the target is intuitively appealing and the paper shows it works well empirically. The calibration itself uses standard methods like isotonic regression.

- The experiments comprehensively evaluate object detection, instance segmentation, and rotated object detection across diverse model architectures. The consistent gains demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed MoCaE approach. The particularly impressive results are the state-of-the-art on rotated object detection on DOTA dataset and the strong gains even for top COCO models like YOLOv7.

- Compared to deep ensembles, MoCaE is shown to be significantly more effective and efficient, giving better gains with fewer models. This demonstrates the value of combining diverse detectors versus just ensembling replicas of the same model.

In summary, the paper explores the promising direction of detector ensembling, proposes a simple but impactful innovation of confidence calibration, and provides thorough experiments across tasks and models. The gains over top existing detectors are noteworthy. The approach feels intuitive and easy to apply in practice. Overall, this is a very solid contribution to the object detection literature in my opinion.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the paper:

1. Extending mixture of calibrated experts (MoCaE) approach to other tasks like semantic segmentation. The authors state that MoCaE could be useful in tasks where different models make complementary errors.

2. Investigating better calibration methods and targets. The authors use a simple post-hoc calibration method (isotonic regression) in the paper. They suggest exploring more advanced calibration techniques. Also, determining ideal calibration targets for different tasks is an open area.

3. Applying MoCaE to larger mixtures with many diverse experts. The paper experiments with combining 2-3 detectors, but using many more diverse experts could lead to further gains. 

4. Exploring cross-dataset or continual learning scenarios. The authors use detectors trained on the same dataset, but combining detectors trained on different datasets could be interesting.

5. Reducing the inference cost of ensembling detectors, such as by sharing computation. The authors note the main limitation currently is increased computation from using multiple models.

6. Extending early calibration to improve training efficiency and performance. The authors show early calibration helps inference, but calibrating during training could be impactful too.

In summary, the main future directions are applying MoCaE to new tasks and scenarios, developing better calibration techniques, and reducing the computational costs of ensembling detectors. The core MoCaE idea could provide value in many detection applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach called Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) to combine different object detectors into an ensemble that outperforms individual detectors. The key ideas are:

1) Naively combining different object detectors into an ensemble does not work well because their confidence scores are incompatible due to different training procedures, architectures, etc. 

2) Calibrating the confidence scores of each detector using the same target calibration function brings them to a common scale and makes them compatible. The calibration target is the IoU of the detection box with the best matched ground truth box.

3) After calibration, the detections from different detectors can be combined using standard techniques like NMS. The calibrated scores allow NMS to select the most accurate detections across detectors. 

4) Extensive experiments on object detection, instance segmentation and rotated object detection show that MoCaE significantly outperforms individual detectors, vanilla ensembles, and deep ensembles. For example, on COCO test-dev, MoCaE improves AP by 2.4 points over the best single model by reaching 59.0 AP.

In summary, the key idea is to calibrate detector confidences before ensembling them to enable accurate and effective aggregation of predictions. This simple but principled approach leads to consistent and significant gains over strong individual detectors.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) to improve object detection by combining multiple object detectors into an ensemble. The key idea is that naively aggregating predictions from different detectors does not work well because their confidence scores are incompatible due to differences in training procedures, architectures, etc. 

To address this, MoCaE first calibrates the confidence scores of each detector individually so that they become compatible. Specifically, the confidence scores are calibrated so that they match the IoU of the predicted bounding box with the ground truth. After calibration, the detections from the different detectors can be aggregated effectively using techniques like NMS. Experiments on COCO, LVIS and DOTA show that MoCaE improves over individual detectors, outperforming them by 2.4 AP on COCO. The method also outperforms deep ensembles, even with fewer detectors. Overall, the paper demonstrates that proper calibration is crucial for obtaining accurate and effective detector ensembles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) to combine different object detectors into an ensemble. The key ideas are:

1. Naively combining different object detectors into an ensemble does not work well because their confidence scores are incompatible due to differences in architectures and training. 

2. To enable an effective ensemble, the paper first calibrates the confidence scores of each detector to a common scale, specifically so that the confidence matches the IoU of the detection box with the ground truth object. This calibrator is learned on a small held-out set.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of how to combine multiple object detectors into an effective ensemble or mixture of experts (MoE). The key challenge it identifies is that naively combining different detectors does not work well because their confidence scores are not calibrated or compatible with each other. 

Specifically, the paper makes the following main points:

- Different object detectors can have very different confidence score distributions, due to differences in architecture, loss functions, etc. This makes it difficult to combine them effectively.

- Simply averaging or taking the maximum confidence scores, as one might do in a deep ensemble, performs poorly for object detection.

- The proposed solution is to first calibrate each detector so that confidence scores match the IoU of predictions. This makes them compatible. 

- The calibrated detectors can then be effectively combined using standard techniques like NMS. This is termed Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE).

- Experiments show MoCaE significantly outperforms both individual detectors and deep ensembles, across object detection, instance segmentation and rotated object detection.

In summary, the key insight is that calibrating detectors is crucial before combining them in an ensemble/MoE, in order to align the confidence scores. This simple idea results in large performance gains.
