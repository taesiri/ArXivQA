# [On the Interplay Between Stepsize Tuning and Progressive Sharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Selecting good learning rates is crucial for training deep neural networks, but manual tuning is time-consuming. Automatic step size tuning methods like Armijo line search and Polyak stepsizes exist, but their performance does not always match theoretical guarantees. 

- Recent work showed deep nets display two distinct phenomena during training: (1) Increasing largest Hessian eigenvalue (progressive sharpening)  (2) Stabilization of eigenvalue around 2/Î³ (edge of stability). Little is known about how these phenomena interact with adaptive step size methods.

Methods
- Evaluate Armijo line search and Polyak stepsizes on CIFAR-10 classification using MLPs, VGGNet, ResNet architectures. 

- Study effect on loss value, Hessian eigenvalue (sharpness metric), step size in full batch (deterministic) and mini-batch (stochastic) settings.

Key Results
- Armijo line search leads to ever-increasing sharpness in deterministic setting and large minibatch setting, performs worse than fixed step size. Polyak stepsize fluctuates at edge of stability, works well.  

- In medium minibatch setting, Armijo performs well, displays some sharpening. Polyak less effective than deterministic setting, but operates near edge of stability.

- With small minibatches, Armijo and Polyak perform poorly, take large steps leading to instability. Performance very sensitive to batch size.

- Simple quadratic model fails to explain observed step size, sharpness dynamics of methods. Understanding their interaction is key.

Contributions  
- First systematic study of how step size tuning methods interact with phenomenon like progressive sharpening and edge of stability in deep nets.

- Empirically shows classical adaptive methods can increase sharpness excessively or operate suboptimally. Polyak stepsizes more robust overall.

- Suggests explicitly modeling joint dynamics of loss landscape, step size, and sharpness is needed to improve adaptive tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the interplay between adaptive step size methods like Armijo line search and Polyak stepsizes and the dynamics of sharpness (largest Hessian eigenvalue) in deep network training, finding that joint dynamics of step size and sharpness are key to understand the performance of adaptive methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper provides a systematic empirical study of the interplay between stepsize tuning methods (Armijo line search and Polyak stepsizes) and the dynamics of loss landscape sharpness in deep neural networks. The key findings are:

1) In the deterministic (full batch) setting, Armijo performs worse than fixed stepsize due to its tendency to increase sharpness without limit, while Polyak outperforms fixed stepsize by operating at or beyond the edge of stability. 

2) In the stochastic (minibatch) setting, Armijo's performance is highly sensitive to batch size, while Polyak is more robust across batch sizes, although less dominant over fixed stepsizes. 

3) Simple theoretical models that only consider the edge of stability are insufficient to explain these observations - the joint dynamics of stepsize and sharpness must be analyzed.

The work suggests that unlocking the potential of adaptive stepsizes in deep learning requires incorporating their interaction with progressive sharpening dynamics. The interplay between stepsize and sharpness is identified as a key open problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper:

- Stepsize tuning - The paper investigates methods for automatically tuning the stepsize (learning rate) in neural network training, such as Armijo line search and Polyak stepsizes.

- Progressive sharpening - The phenomenon where the sharpness (largest Hessian eigenvalue) of the loss landscape increases over the course of training. 

- Edge of stability (EOS) - The critical eigenvalue value ($2/\gamma$ for stepsize $\gamma$) that gradient descent can converge to. Prior work has shown sharpness stabilizing around this edge of stability value.

- Sharpness dynamics - How the sharpness of the loss landscape changes over the course of training. The paper studies how stepsize tuning methods impact sharpness dynamics.

- Armijo line search - A standard deterministic optimization method for setting stepsizes, adapted to stochastic gradient descent. 

- Polyak stepsizes - A recently proposed stochastic gradient descent stepsize rule with theoretical convergence guarantees.

- Joint dynamics - The coupled dynamics between the stepsize scheduling and the sharpness. The paper argues these joint dynamics are key to understand the behavior of stepsize tuning methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods and findings in this paper:

1. The paper observes that the Armijo line search leads to ever-increasing sharpness in the deterministic setting. What theories or hypotheses could explain why standard line search methods would lead to progressive sharpening in deep learning optimization?

2. The paper notes Polyak stepsizes perform well and seem to operate at or above the edge of stability. What properties of the Polyak stepsize rule might explain this behavior and its improved performance over Armijo line search?

3. The paper finds Armijo line search is highly sensitive to batch size in the stochastic setting. What explanations could there be for why smaller batches would lead to poorer performance? How might this relate to the theory of interpolation vs extrapolation regimes?

4. The paper argues understanding joint dynamics of sharpness and step size is key to improving step size rules. What mathematical models or analyses could be proposed to capture these coupled dynamics? How might they extend existing analyses?  

5. This paper studies sharpness and optimization dynamics on reduced datasets. How would the phenomena explored likely change on much larger and more complex datasets? What new dynamics might emerge?

6. The paper focuses on simple SGD-based methods. How might the interplay between sharpness and step size tuning change for methods with momentum, preconditioning, or second-order information?  

7. Real-world models often involve additional complications like regularization or normalization layers. How might these impact the sharpness and step size tuning dynamics uncovered?

8. The paper studies basic MLP and CNN models. Would the dynamics differ significantly for other modern network architectures? What architectures might show interesting differences?

9. The experiments fix most hyperparameters like weight decay and only vary step size rules. How sensitive are the findings to other optimizer hyperparameters settings?

10. The paper analyzes train sharpness and loss values. How might the findings change if one were to instead analyze test set generalization? Could sharpness or step size tuning provide implicit regularization?
