# [Characterising harmful data sources when constructing multi-fidelity   surrogate models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Surrogate models are often used to approximate expensive black-box functions in areas like industrial design. These models can fuse data from a high-fidelity (expensive) source with cheaper, lower fidelity sources. 
- Recent work has shown that using a low-fidelity source can be harmful if it is not sufficiently correlated with the high-fidelity source. 
- However, prior characterizations of "harmful" low-fidelity sources have relied on large amounts of data not available in practice. There is a need for guidelines based only on the limited data used to train the models.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a visualization technique called Instance Space Analysis (ISA) to characterize when low-fidelity sources are harmful or beneficial for building Kriging (single-source) and Co-Kriging (two-source) surrogate models.
- Construct an unbiased benchmark suite with 321 function pairs, including synthetic and simulation-based sources. Apply instance filtering to avoid overrepresented instance types.
- Compare Kriging and Co-Kriging accuracy over multiple trials and use features related to source correlation, landscape properties and data budgets to visualize performance differences in a 2D instance space.
- Train SVM classifiers to predict when Kriging or Co-Kriging will have better performance based on location in the instance space. Derive guidelines using single feature value trends.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of an unbiased benchmark suite for future research on multi-fidelity modeling. Includes new disturbanced-based synthetic functions.
- Visualization and analysis of when low-fidelity sources are harmful vs. beneficial for common surrogate models, using only limited data available in practice. 
- New guidelines for deciding whether to use Kriging or Co-Kriging based on data budgets, local correlation characteristics, and model accuracy features.
- Demonstration that Co-Kriging should only be used when the low-fidelity source is clearly beneficial. Otherwise Kriging is safer.
- Overall, provides actionable insights for practitioners on exploiting multiple data sources effectively.
