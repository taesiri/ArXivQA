# [Learning Cortical Anomaly through Masked Encoding for Unsupervised   Heterogeneity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02762)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework called CAM (Cortical Anomaly detection through Masked image modeling) for unsupervised detection of complex brain disorders using cortical surface features extracted from structural MRI. The key components involve learning representations of cortical features through a pretext task of masked image modeling using a vision transformer encoder, followed by an iterative masked anomaly detection algorithm to identify deviations from the learned healthy patterns. Experiments demonstrate CAM's capabilities in distinguishing various psychotic spectrum disorders from healthy controls, achieving AUCs up to 0.769 for Schizophreniform, without needing any labels. The identified cortical regions with high anomaly scores, such as Pars Triangularis and frontal areas, align with previous literature on abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia. Overall, this work demonstrates a scalable approach for detecting anomalies indicative of mental illnesses based on analyzing intricate morphological patterns along the cortical surface, providing a novel perspective that could aid diagnosis and enhance understanding of these heterogeneous disorders.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework, CAM, for unsupervised detection of complex brain disorders like psychotic spectrum disorders using cortical surface features extracted from structural MRI, demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in identifying schizophrenia-related cortical abnormalities without the need for labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is summarized in the following key points:

1) The authors introduced a novel method called CAM (Cortical Anomaly detection through Masked image modeling) that learns high-dimensional abstractions from cortical features for unsupervised brain anomaly detection.

2) They demonstrated the effectiveness of CAM in distinguishing psychotic disorders like Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Schizoaffective, and Schizophreniform from healthy controls, without requiring any labels.

3) They showed that CAM can identify key cortical regions like Pars Triangularis and frontal areas that have been previously implicated in schizophrenia, thus providing further validation and confidence in the approach.

In summary, the main contribution is a scalable approach for unsupervised anomaly detection of complex brain disorders based on learning patterns of abnormalities in cortical features. The method shows promising performance in detecting psychotic spectrum disorders and highlighting associated cortical anomalies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called CAM that utilizes a self-supervised learning approach for unsupervised anomaly detection. Can you elaborate on why a self-supervised learning approach was chosen over other unsupervised learning methods? What are the advantages?

2. The Iterative Masked Anomaly Detection algorithm iteratively masks patches from the input and reconstructs them to compute an anomaly score. Can you explain the intuition behind this approach and why it is effective for anomaly detection? 

3. The paper extracts multiple cortical surface features like thickness, curvature etc. and evaluates the framework individually on each feature. Which feature provided the best performance for psychosis detection and why do you think that is the case?

4. The vision transformer encoder used in CAM has certain hyperparameters like number of layers, heads etc. Can you explain the impact each of these hyperparameters have on model performance and how they were tuned?

5. The paper identifies certain cortical regions like Pars Triangularis to be anomalous in psychosis spectrum disorders. What is the significance of these regions in the context of psychosis and how does it validate the capability of CAM?

6. The paper demonstrates superior performance over statistical shape features. What are the limitations of statistical shape features that cortical surface features overcome according to the paper?

7. The framework is evaluated on the left hemisphere only due to symmetry of the brain. Do you think incorporating right hemisphere features can further improve performance? Why or why not?

8. The paper focuses on cortical thickness features only for analysis of regions. Do you think incorporating anomalies from other features can provide deeper insights? Why or why not?

9. The framework is trained on healthy subjects only. How can the lack of representation from disorder groups impact what CAM learns to encode as normal representations?

10. The paper proposes potential applications for early detection and identifying novel biomarkers. What challenges do you foresee in deploying CAM in a clinical setup?
