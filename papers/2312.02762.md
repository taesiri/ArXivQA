# [Learning Cortical Anomaly through Masked Encoding for Unsupervised   Heterogeneity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02762)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework called CAM (Cortical Anomaly detection through Masked image modeling) for unsupervised detection of complex brain disorders using cortical surface features extracted from structural MRI. The key components involve learning representations of cortical features through a pretext task of masked image modeling using a vision transformer encoder, followed by an iterative masked anomaly detection algorithm to identify deviations from the learned healthy patterns. Experiments demonstrate CAM's capabilities in distinguishing various psychotic spectrum disorders from healthy controls, achieving AUCs up to 0.769 for Schizophreniform, without needing any labels. The identified cortical regions with high anomaly scores, such as Pars Triangularis and frontal areas, align with previous literature on abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia. Overall, this work demonstrates a scalable approach for detecting anomalies indicative of mental illnesses based on analyzing intricate morphological patterns along the cortical surface, providing a novel perspective that could aid diagnosis and enhance understanding of these heterogeneous disorders.
