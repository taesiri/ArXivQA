# [AmbigNLG: Addressing Task Ambiguity in Instruction for NLG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17717)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in executing a wide range of natural language tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on the clarity and specificity of the instructions provided.
- Ambiguous instructions lead to unsatisfactory outcomes as the models struggle to generate outputs that meet user expectations. This is especially evident in complex natural language generation (NLG) tasks.
- Prior work has addressed ambiguity mainly in natural language understanding (NLU) problems. Different strategies are needed for the more varied context of NLG tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces AmbigNLG, a new task to address "task ambiguity in instructions" for NLG problems. 
- An ambiguity taxonomy with 6 dominant types (\textsc{Context}, \textsc{Keywords}, \textsc{Length}, \textsc{Planning}, \textsc{Style}, \textsc{Theme}) is proposed to categorize ambiguities.
- Instructions are refined by generating additional instructions to mitigate each identified ambiguity category. 
- A dataset called AmbigSNI$_{\texttt{NLG}}$ with 2,500 instances annotated using the taxonomy is introduced.

Key Contributions:
- Formulation of AmbigNLG task to resolve ambiguity in instructions for NLG
- Development of taxonomy to categorize ambiguity in NLG instructions 
- Approach to mitigate ambiguity by augmenting instructions with additional clarifications  
- Introduction of AmbigSNI$_{\texttt{NLG}}$ dataset comprising 2,500 annotated instances
- Analysis showing significant gains from disambiguation, especially for large models like GPT-3.5

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in identifying and addressing the critical challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for natural language generation. The proposed taxonomy and mitigation techniques demonstrate the potential to substantially improve model performance on NLG tasks.
