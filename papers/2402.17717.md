# [AmbigNLG: Addressing Task Ambiguity in Instruction for NLG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17717)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in executing a wide range of natural language tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on the clarity and specificity of the instructions provided.
- Ambiguous instructions lead to unsatisfactory outcomes as the models struggle to generate outputs that meet user expectations. This is especially evident in complex natural language generation (NLG) tasks.
- Prior work has addressed ambiguity mainly in natural language understanding (NLU) problems. Different strategies are needed for the more varied context of NLG tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces AmbigNLG, a new task to address "task ambiguity in instructions" for NLG problems. 
- An ambiguity taxonomy with 6 dominant types (\textsc{Context}, \textsc{Keywords}, \textsc{Length}, \textsc{Planning}, \textsc{Style}, \textsc{Theme}) is proposed to categorize ambiguities.
- Instructions are refined by generating additional instructions to mitigate each identified ambiguity category. 
- A dataset called AmbigSNI$_{\texttt{NLG}}$ with 2,500 instances annotated using the taxonomy is introduced.

Key Contributions:
- Formulation of AmbigNLG task to resolve ambiguity in instructions for NLG
- Development of taxonomy to categorize ambiguity in NLG instructions 
- Approach to mitigate ambiguity by augmenting instructions with additional clarifications  
- Introduction of AmbigSNI$_{\texttt{NLG}}$ dataset comprising 2,500 annotated instances
- Analysis showing significant gains from disambiguation, especially for large models like GPT-3.5

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in identifying and addressing the critical challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for natural language generation. The proposed taxonomy and mitigation techniques demonstrate the potential to substantially improve model performance on NLG tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces AmbigNLG, a new task for addressing ambiguity in natural language generation instructions to enhance model performance, along with a taxonomy, method, and dataset for ambiguity mitigation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing AmbigNLG, a new task designed to tackle the challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Specifically:

- They propose a method to mitigate task ambiguity by establishing an ambiguity taxonomy to categorize different types of ambiguous instructions, and generating additional instructions to clarify the intent based on this taxonomy.

- They construct a dataset called AmbigSNI$_{\texttt{NLG}}$ with 2,500 instances annotated with ambiguity types and additional instructions to facilitate research on this task. 

- Their analysis shows that mitigating ambiguity using their method leads to improved text generation quality across several state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the importance of clear and specific instructions for maximizing LLM performance on NLG tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is formalizing the problem of task ambiguity in NLG instructions and providing a practical solution and benchmark to address this challenge. Resolving ambiguity is shown to significantly enhance model outputs in NLG.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed ambiguity taxonomy for NLG tasks differ from previous approaches to addressing ambiguity in NLU tasks? What novel categories of ambiguity does it identify that are specific to challenges in NLG?

2) What were the key considerations and process behind manually curating high-quality examples of ambiguity annotations from the SNI dataset? What criteria guided the selection of appropriate instances? 

3) Why was an LLM-in-the-loop approach chosen for generating additional ambiguity mitigation instructions, rather than crowdsourcing? What are the main benefits and potential limitations of this semi-automated approach?

4) How was the utility of generated additional instructions evaluated during the validation stage? What metrics and statistical testing were used to determine if they led to outputs more closely aligned with desired texts?

5) What findings from the analysis illuminate why certain ambiguity categories like Context, Keywords and Theme were most prevalent across tasks? What intrinsic qualities of these categories drive ambiguity?

6) What explains the performance fluctuations and ranking shifts noticed between models on some tasks after disambiguation? How do model architectures and task requirements interact with ambiguity mitigation?

7) For suggesting mitigation instructions, why does constraining language models to pre-defined templates boost relevance but reduce diversity compared to open-ended generation? How can these trade-offs be balanced?

8) How do the prompts provided to models during ambiguity identification, suggestion and mitigation impact performance on those respective sub-tasks? What role does prompt engineering play?

9) In what practical scenarios could the end-to-end pipeline proposed for AmbigNLG be applied? What kinds of real-world systems could benefit from embedded ambiguity handling mechanisms?

10) What limitations remain in the scope and evaluation protocols used for analysis? What impact could factors like dataset scale, task coverage and choice of language models have on the conclusions drawn?
