# [Adaptive Cross-Layer Attention for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03619)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an attention module that can effectively aggregate information from different layers to improve image restoration performance. The key hypothesis is that allowing each query pixel to attend to key pixels from multiple previous layers can help capture useful correlations across layers and scale levels. This is in contrast to standard attention modules that only look within the same layer.Specifically, the paper proposes a new Adaptive Cross-Layer Attention (ACLA) module with two key adaptive components:1) Adaptively selecting the keys from each layer for non-local attention at each query location. This allows picking the most relevant keys at each layer instead of a fixed number.2) Automatically searching for the best insertion locations to add the ACLA modules within the network backbone. This enables optimizing the trade-off between performance gains and computational cost.The central hypothesis is that by using these two adaptive designs, ACLA can selectively aggregate multi-scale information in an efficient and effective way to boost image restoration performance. Experiments on tasks like super-resolution, denoising, demoisaicing etc. are used to validate the benefits of the proposed approach.In summary, the key research question is how to design a flexible cross-layer attention mechanism that can improve image restoration by selectively propagating information across network layers in an efficient adaptive manner. The ACLA module with its two adaptive components is proposed as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Adaptive Cross-Layer Attention (ACLA), a novel attention module for image restoration. The key ideas of ACLA are:1. Each query pixel attends to key pixels from multiple previous layers of the network, instead of just within the same layer like in standard non-local attention. This allows aggregating information across layers.2. An adaptive number of keys are selected from each previous layer for each query pixel. This is done by learning gating masks on the sampled keys. 3. The insert positions for ACLA modules in the network backbone are automatically searched for using a differentiable NAS method. This aims to find optimal positions to insert ACLA while maintaining efficiency.4. Extensive experiments on image super-resolution, denoising, demosaicing and compression artifact reduction demonstrate that ACLA outperforms previous attention mechanisms like non-local attention. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the adaptive designs in ACLA.In summary, the main contribution is proposing ACLA, a cross-layer attention mechanism with adaptive key selection and automatic search for insert positions, and showing its benefits for various image restoration tasks over prior arts.
