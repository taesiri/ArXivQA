# [Just Cluster It: An Approach for Exploration in High-Dimensions using   Clustering and Pre-Trained Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03138)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Exploration in reinforcement learning can be viewed as a density estimation problem, where the goal is to approximate the density of the state space. This allows determining which parts of the environment have been visited.
- Simply counting states is effective for tabular cases, but becomes intractable in high dimensions. Prior work has proposed estimating "pseudo-counts" relative to a density model.
- The paper identifies a key challenge in 3D environments: while pixel changes between transitions have high magnitude, their actual significance/saliency is low. This is in contrast to 2D environments where pixel changes are usually more distinct and meaningful.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a method to perform exploration via episodic and global clustering of (pre-trained) representations to estimate pseudo-counts.
- In each episode, they fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on DINO representations or random features to determine cluster centers and assign states to clusters.
- They maintain a global cluster table that accumulates pseudo-counts over time by matching new episodic clusters based on a cosine similarity threshold. This is inspired by the "stick breaking" process in Dirichlet processes.
- The intrinsic reward bonus is calculated as the inverse square root of pseudo-counts.

Contributions:
- Proposes a exploration method based on clustering representations to estimate pseudo-counts, involving episodic clustering per episode and global clustering over time.
- Shows both random features and DINO features can be effectively clustered in 3D environments, with DINO features helping significantly in visually complex environments.
- Ablations analyze the effect of cosine similarity threshold and episodic clustering, demonstrating their necessity for effective state aggregation.
- Overall, presents an approach to incorporate pre-trained representational biases into exploration, and demonstrates strong performance in VizDoom and Habitat 3D environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an exploration method for reinforcement learning that performs episodic and global clustering of pre-trained representations or random features to estimate pseudo-counts for high-dimensional 3D environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(i) It introduces an exploration method that estimates pseudo-counts by clustering pre-trained representations, using both episodic and global clustering. Specifically, it fits a Gaussian mixture model on representations from a pre-trained DINO model or on random features to perform episodic clustering. It then matches the episodic clusters to a global cluster table over time to estimate pseudo-counts.

(ii) It shows that both random features and DINO features can be effectively clustered to estimate pseudo-counts for exploration in 3D environments like VizDoom and Habitat. While random features work well in simpler 3D environments, DINO features leverage useful priors that improve performance substantially in more complex, real-world observations.

(iii) Through ablations of the cosine similarity threshold and episodic clustering components, it demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering for exploration in high-dimensional 3D environments. The episodic clustering in particular helps aggregate similar representations to get better pseudo-counts.

In summary, the main contribution is an exploration method based on clustering (both episodic and global) of representations to estimate pseudo-counts, along with an analysis showing this is an effective approach for exploration in complex 3D environments.

The paper proposes an exploration method for reinforcement learning that involves clustering pre-trained representations like DINO on an episodic and global level to estimate pseudo-counts and determine novelty/explore the environment. It evaluates this approach on complex 3D environments like VizDoom and Habitat and shows it is effective for exploration compared to other methods. The key ideas focus around using clustering of representations to aggregate states and estimate densities for effective exploration.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper argues that pixel changes in 3D environments often lack saliency compared to 2D environments. Can you expand more on why this is the case? What specifically makes pixel changes less meaningful in 3D contexts?

2) The episodic clustering involves fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the representations in each episode. What advantages does a GMM provide over simpler clustering algorithms like k-means? How sensitive is the performance to choosing the right number of mixture components? 

3) When adding new episodic clusters to the global table, a cosine similarity threshold κ is used. What is the impact of choosing κ too small or too large? How can the concentration parameter in Dirichlet processes be related to κ?

4) Pre-trained DINO features seem to outperform random features substantially in the Habitat environment but not in VizDoom. What visual factors in the Habitat environments make the DINO features more useful compared to VizDoom?

5) Could the proposed method be extended to use sequential representations from models like CLIP-Seq instead of the CLS token from DINO? What challenges might this introduce?

6) The episodic clustering seems crucial for performance in complex observations like Habitat. Why does removing it impact DINO features more than random features? What structure is it exploiting?

7) One could imagine combining this clustering approach with prediction error-based methods like RND. Could pseudo-counts estimated from clustered representations make prediction errors more salient?  

8) How well would this method transfer to exploring 3D environments with greater observational noise from random objects? Would the clustering be robust?

9) Can ideas from this method apply to model-based RL? Could learned environment models produce useful representations for episodic and global clustering?

10) The performance difference between DINO and Random features is quite small in VizDoom but large in Habitat. What specific visual factors lead to such different results across the two environments?
