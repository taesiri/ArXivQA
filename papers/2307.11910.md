# [Constraining white dwarf mass and magnetic field strength of a new   intermediate polar through X-ray observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11910)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can the authors develop a regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals of the form $\int F(D^2u) dx$ under compactly supported variations? Here $F$ is assumed to be a smooth, uniformly convex (or concave) function of the Hessian. The associated Euler-Lagrange equation is a fully nonlinear fourth order PDE in double divergence form. 

2) Under what conditions on the Hessian $D^2u$ can the authors obtain smoothness of critical points? In particular, can they relax the assumption of small $L^{\infty}$ oscillation of the Hessian used in previous works to small oscillation in a BMO sense?

3) As a consequence of their regularity theory, can the authors obtain improved dimension estimates on the interior singular set of critical points compared to what is known for second order elliptic systems? 

The main results are:

- An epsilon-regularity theorem showing that if the Hessian of a $W^{2,\infty}$ critical point has small BMO oscillation, then the critical point is smooth.

- As a consequence, they obtain a dimension estimate of $n-p_0$ on the interior singular set, for some $p_0>2$, which improves upon analogous results for second order systems.

- They demonstrate applications of their theory to establish regularity of solutions to the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian equation in complex geometry. 

- They also use this geometric equation to illustrate the importance of the a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption, showing it likely cannot be easily relaxed without additional assumptions.

So in summary, the main focus is on developing a regularity theory for a class of fourth order nonlinear PDE through imposing a small BMO oscillation condition on the Hessian of solutions. This gives improved dimension estimates on singular sets and applications to geometric PDE. The a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption is shown to be necessary in this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals of the form $\int F(D^2u)$ defined on Hessian spaces, under compactly supported variations. The critical point $u$ satisfies a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. 

2. The key result is an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem (Theorem 1.1) which shows that if $u\in W^{2,\infty}$ is a critical point and its Hessian has small bounded mean oscillation (BMO), then $u$ is smooth. This is proved by first establishing uniform $C^{1,1}$ and then $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimates on $u$.

3. As a consequence, the authors obtain a dimension estimate on the interior singular set of $u$ (Corollary 1.2), showing that it has Hausdorff dimension at most $n-p_0$ for some $p_0>2$. This relies on the higher integrability of $u$.

4. The results are applied to variational problems arising in Lagrangian geometry, such as the Hamiltonian stationary equation. The importance of the a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption on $u$ is also demonstrated through this application.

5. The paper develops some technical tools for establishing regularity of solutions with small BMO coefficients, adapting prior work of Han and Lin. A key ingredient is a Caccioppoli-type inequality exploiting higher integrability.

In summary, the paper significantly advances the regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals on Hessian spaces by weakening the small oscillation hypothesis to small BMO and obtains a dimension estimate on the singular set. The results have implications for nonlinear PDEs arising in geometry and analysis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals defined on Hessian spaces of functions, under the assumptions of convexity/concavity and small bounded mean oscillation of the Hessian; as a consequence, the interior singular set of a critical point is shown to have dimension at most $n-p_0$ for some $p_0\in(2,3)$.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a high-level analysis of how this paper on variational integrals on Hessian spaces compares to other related research:

- It builds on prior work by the authors Bhattacharya and Warren on regularity theory for certain fourth order nonlinear elliptic equations in double divergence form. The current paper extends those techniques to study critical points of variational integrals of the form $\int F(D^2u)$ under compactly supported variations.

- A key contribution is proving an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem: if the Hessian of a critical point has small bounded mean oscillation (BMO), then the solution is smooth. This improves on previous results requiring small oscillation in $L^\infty$. 

- As an application, the authors establish a dimension estimate on the interior singular set of critical points. This is analogous to results for minimizers of second order variational problems.

- The paper demonstrates the utility of these Hessian space variational problems in Lagrangian geometry. In particular, the results are applied to establish regularity of critical points of the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian equation.

- Compared to the second order setting, the analysis of these fourth order problems is less developed. There are open questions regarding optimal regularity assumptions and whether singular sets can be completely precluded using the additional structure.

- Overall, this paper makes significant progress on the regularity theory for an important class of fourth order variational problems and nonlinear PDEs arising in geometry. It adapts state-of-the-art techniques from the second order setting and provides a framework for further investigation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Study the regularity of critical points for variational integrals of the form in Eq. (1) when the Hessian $D^2u$ lies in a non-convex region $U$. The current results rely heavily on the convexity of $U$, so extending to non-convex settings would be interesting.

- Relax the a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption on critical points $u$. As discussed in Section 5.2, it may be possible to weaken this to $W^{2,p}$ for some $p<infty$, but additional assumptions would likely be needed. This could potentially lead to improved interior regularity results.

- Sharpen the dimension estimate on the singular set in Corollary 1.2. As noted in Remark 1.3, the current estimate is likely not optimal due to the additional structure coming from the 4th order equation. Determining the optimal estimate is an open problem.

- Extend the results to other important 4th order equations arising variationally, such as the Abreu equation, prescribed affine curvature equations, and interacting agent problems (mentioned in the Introduction). The current methods should apply fairly broadly, but working out the details for specific equations would be interesting.

- Apply the techniques to study geometric PDEs arising from critical points of the volume functional, like the Hamiltonian stationary equation. Regularizing effects of the PDE's structure could potentially lead to improved regularity over what is currently known.

- Generalize the methods and results to systems of fourth order equations, which arise in elasticity theory and other areas. The current work focuses on scalar equations, so the system case presents additional challenges.

In summary, the main open questions involve relaxing assumptions on the Hessian $D^2u$, sharpening dimension estimates on singular sets, extending the techniques to other settings like systems of equations, and applying the ideas to important geometric PDEs and equations from the calculus of variations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

This paper develops regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals defined on Hessian spaces over bounded domains in Euclidean space, under compactly supported variations. The critical point solves a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. The authors show that for smooth convex functionals, a critical point with bounded Hessian is smooth provided its Hessian has small bounded mean oscillation (BMO). They deduce that the interior singular set of a critical point has Hausdorff dimension at most n-p_0 for some p_0 in (2,3). Applications to variational problems in Lagrangian geometry are discussed. The importance of the a priori W^{2,\infty} regularity assumption on the critical point is demonstrated using the Hamiltonian stationary equation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper develops regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals defined on Hessian spaces of functions on bounded domains in Euclidean space. The critical point solves a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. The authors show that for smooth convex functionals, a critical point with bounded Hessian is smooth provided that its Hessian has small bounded mean oscillation (BMO). As a consequence, they deduce that the interior singular set of a critical point has Hausdorff dimension at most n-p_0 for some p_0 between 2 and 3.  

The paper states some applications of the results to variational problems in Lagrangian geometry. The authors use the Hamiltonian stationary equation to demonstrate the importance of their a priori assumption on the regularity of the critical point. Key steps in the proofs include establishing higher integrability for the Hessian, a delicate estimate controlling the ratio of L^p norms of the Hessian on varying scales, and making use of a technical lemma adapted from prior work to absorb error terms when getting a scaled estimate. The dimension estimate on the singular set follows from a covering argument.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper develops regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals of the form $\int F(D^2u)dx$ defined on Hessian spaces of functions on bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, under compactly supported variations. The critical point $u$ satisfies a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. The main result shows that if $F$ is a smooth uniformly convex functional, and $u$ has bounded Hessian in $W^{2,\infty}$ with small bounded mean oscillation (BMO), then $u$ is smooth. The proof involves first establishing uniform $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimates for $u$, using a difference quotient method to linearize the equation and apply a variant of Gehring's lemma. This leads to improved integrability of the third derivatives of $u$. Smoothness then follows from the $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate combined with earlier results on interior regularity. A dimension estimate on the interior singular set is also deduced.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper is developing regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals that depend on the Hessian of a function, under compactly supported variations. These types of variational integrals arise in various areas like elasticity theory, fluid dynamics, and geometry. 

The main question the paper addresses is: under what conditions can we prove regularity and smoothness for critical points of such variational integrals?

Specifically, the paper considers variational integrals of the form:

$\int_{\Omega} F(D^2u) dx$

Where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in R^n, and F is a smooth, uniformly convex (or concave) function of the Hessian D^2u. 

The critical points of such integrals satisfy a fourth order nonlinear PDE of "double divergence" form. The main result shows that if u is a W^{2,\infty} critical point whose Hessian has small bounded mean oscillation (BMO), then u is actually smooth. This is proved using an epsilon-regularity argument. 

The paper also deduces a dimension estimate on the interior singular set under less restrictive assumptions.

Some applications to problems in Lagrangian geometry are discussed. The importance of the a priori W^{2,\infty} regularity assumption is also demonstrated using the Hamiltonian stationary equation.

In summary, the main focus is developing regularity theory for a class of fourth order variational problems and equations that arise in various contexts. The key innovation is proving smoothness assuming only small BMO modulus of continuity for the Hessian.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes a priori that the critical point $u$ is in $W^{2,\infty}(B_1)$. What happens if we relax this regularity assumption to $W^{2,p}(B_1)$ for some $p<+\infty$? Can the methods still be applied and under what additional assumptions?

2. In the proof of Theorem 1.1, the small BMO modulus assumption on the Hessian $D^2u$ is used. What is the intuition behind requiring small BMO oscillation rather than small $L^{\infty}$ oscillation as in previous work by the authors? 

3. How does the method take advantage of the specific double divergence structure of the Euler-Lagrange equation? Could similar results hold for other fourth order equations not coming from a variational principle?

4. The paper claims the interior singular set has Hausdorff dimension at most $n-p_0$. Do you expect this estimate to be sharp? What techniques could improve upon this dimension estimate?

5. The Hamiltonian stationary equation example demonstrates the need for a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity. What other possible methods or assumptions could relax this to $W^{2,p}$ for finite $p$?

6. How does the method use properties of the Hessian as opposed to gradients? Could similar results hold for variational problems defined on gradient spaces?

7. What is the significance of using compactly supported variations as opposed to other classes of variations? How does this impact the Euler-Lagrange equation and proofs?

9. Can the Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity condition be relaxed or generalized for the techniques to still apply?

10. The paper claims the result holds for both convex and concave functionals. How does the proof differ in these two cases? Is one more difficult than the other?
