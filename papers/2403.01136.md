# [LLM-PQ: Serving LLM on Heterogeneous Clusters with Phase-Aware Partition   and Adaptive Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show great performance but are very large, requiring multiple GPUs for serving. Most solutions use homogeneous GPU clusters.
- Serving LLMs on heterogeneous GPU clusters can reduce cost by better utilizing available GPUs of different capabilities. But existing solutions of model parallelism and compression are not designed for heterogeneous devices.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LLM-PQ, a system for efficient LLM serving on heterogeneous GPU clusters.
- It uses adaptive mixed-precision quantization to match different GPU memory capacities. Layers mapped to high-memory GPUs use higher precision for better accuracy.
- It does phase-aware model partition, considering different execution time patterns in the prefill and decode phases during generative inference.
- An indicator is designed to guide quantization bitwidth assignment for layers based on output variance to balance memory utilization and model quality.
- An algorithm searches the large space of possible partitions, quantization configurations and micro-batch sizes to optimize inference latency and model quality.

Main Contributions:
- An accurate analytical memory model and a learned latency model for mixed-precision LLM inference.
- Introduction of adaptive mixed-precision quantization into pipeline parallel LLM serving on heterogeneous devices.
- A variance-based indicator to guide per-layer bitwidth selection for quantization.
- An algorithm that solves layer partitioning, quantization configuration and micro-batch sizing by combining exhaustive search and an ILP formulation.
- Extensive evaluation on production clusters shows LLM-PQ improves throughput by up to 2.88x over state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel system LLM-PQ that, for the first time, provides an efficient solution to serve large language models on heterogeneous GPU clusters through adaptive quantization and phase-aware optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes LLM-PQ, a system that enables efficient serving of large language models on heterogeneous GPU clusters through adaptive model quantization and phase-aware partition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes LLM-PQ, a system that enables efficient serving of large language models (LLMs) on heterogeneous GPU clusters. LLM-PQ advocates adaptive model quantization and phase-aware partition to improve serving efficiency.

2. It provides accurate cost models to predict memory usage and execution latency of mixed-precision LLM serving on heterogeneous devices. 

3. It introduces a variance indicator to quantify model perturbation by quantization and guide the selection of quantization bits during the joint optimization of partition and quantization.

4. It develops an iterative algorithm that explores the large solution space and solves an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to determine the optimal partition, quantization bits, and micro-batch sizes.

5. Extensive experiments on 11 clusters show that LLM-PQ improves throughput by up to 2.88x (2.26x on average) over state-of-the-art approaches for serving LLMs on heterogeneous clusters.

In summary, the key innovation is the joint optimization framework and algorithms that adaptively determine partition, precision, and scheduling for efficient LLM serving on heterogeneous GPU clusters. The system significantly improves throughput while meeting target model quality levels.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on serving and deploying large transformer-based language models that have hundreds of millions to trillions of parameters.

- Generative inference: The paper specifically looks at autoregressive language model inference where tokens are generated sequentially conditioned on preceding context. This involves a prefill and decode phase.

- Heterogeneous clusters: The paper focuses on efficiently serving LLMs on clusters with a mix of high-capacity (e.g. A100) and low-capacity (e.g. T4) GPUs.

- Adaptive mixed-precision quantization: Quantizing different layers of the LLM models to different precisions based on the GPU capacity, to maximize memory utilization and throughput. 

- Phase-aware model partitioning: Splitting and placing the LLM layers across heterogeneous GPUs in a way that accounts for the different computational patterns in the prefill and decode phases.

- Micro-batch scheduling: Strategies for scheduling prompt sequences into micro-batches of different sizes for the prefill and decode stages.

- Token generation throughput: A key optimization objective, measured in tokens generated per second. Tradeoffs with model quality are explored.

So in summary, key terms cover large language models, heterogeneous serving, adaptive precision quantization, phase-aware partitioning, micro-batching, and inference throughput.
