## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Modeling complex and diverse high-dimensional data distributions like images is challenging for generative models. Previous methods have limitations likecomplex concepts/operations, inability to map samples back to latents, inefficient for images, or require multi-step iterative generation.  

Solution - Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN):
The core idea is to approximate the data distribution using multiple discrete sample points concurrently generated by the network. The network outputs a discrete distribution with K samples representing the sample space. The goal is to make this discrete distribution approximate the target data distribution.  

A hierarchical conditional structure is used to exponentially expand the output space for better approximation while keeping K small per layer. There are L layers with K outputs each. One output is selected per layer based on similarity to target, then fed as condition to next layer to generate outputs more similar to target.  

Main Contributions:
1) A simpler generative model DDN with discrete hierarchical output structure leading to an exponential sample space.

2) Proposed Split-and-Prune optimization to address "dead nodes" and "density shift" issues when using similarity based selection during training. Helps match target distribution better.  

3) DDN shows intriguing properties like highly compressed discrete latent representation and powerful zero-shot conditional generation ability using non-pixel domain conditions without needing gradients.

4) Conducted experiments on CIFAR and FFHQ datasets to demonstrate DDN's generative quality, zero-shot conditional generation, efficient latent representation, and impact of various architectural choices.

In summary, DDN is proposed as a simpler and more direct form of generative model with discrete hierarchical structure leading to promising properties like zero-shot conditional generation and high compression discrete latents.
