# [The Wisdom of Crowds: Temporal Progressive Attention for Early Action   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively predict actions early from partially observed videos. The key ideas and hypotheses are:

- Modeling the temporal evolution of actions through progressively larger video scales is better suited for early prediction compared to using a single scale. 

- Utilizing multiple transformer towers, one per scale, to attend to fine-to-coarse representations can effectively model the ongoing action. 

- Aggregating predictions from these towers by considering their confidence and collective agreement can further improve early action prediction.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a temporally progressive multi-scale representation combined with transformer towers and adaptive aggregation leads to improved performance on early action prediction from partially observed videos. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across datasets and backbones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a temporally progressive attention model called TemPr for early action prediction. The key ideas are:

- Using multiple scales (fine to coarse temporal segments) of the partially observed video as input to capture the evolution of actions over different durations. 

- Employing multiple transformer attention towers, one for each scale, to model features and make predictions. Towers attend to features using a cross-attention bottleneck and stacked self-attention blocks.

- Aggregating predictions from the towers by considering both the agreement between tower predictions and their individual confidences. 

- Showcasing state-of-the-art performance on early action prediction across multiple datasets (UCF-101, Epic Kitchens, NTU-RGB, Something-Something) and encoder architectures.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way of representing partial videos using progressive scales and modeling them with transformer towers for early action prediction. The tower predictions are aggregated adaptively based on agreement and confidence. This approach achieves strong results across diverse datasets compared to prior work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here's a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a Temporally Progressive (TemPr) model for early action prediction that uses multiple attention towers to capture features at different temporal scales from partially observed videos and aggregates their predictions based on confidence and agreement.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of early action prediction:

- Uses progressive temporal sampling at multiple scales: This differs from most prior work that uses uniform sampling or focuses on a single temporal scale. Sampling at multiple fine-to-coarse scales allows the model to capture discriminative motion patterns over different durations.

- Employs multiple transformer towers: Rather than using a single model, this paper proposes an ensemble of transformer towers operating on the different temporal scales. This allows combining predictions in an adaptive way. Most prior work uses a single model. 

- Achieves state-of-the-art results: The proposed TemPr model with the multi-scale progressive sampling and tower ensemble achieves new state-of-the-art results across several datasets, outperforming recent methods.

- Evaluates on large-scale datasets: Many prior works evaluate early action prediction on small datasets of less than 100K videos. This paper additionally benchmarks on large datasets like Something-Something V2 and EPIC-Kitchens with 200K+ videos, demonstrating stronger generalizability.

- Detailed ablation studies: The paper provides extensive ablation studies analyzing the impact of different components like sampling strategies, tower designs, prediction aggregation, etc. This provides useful analysis and insights beyond just reporting end results.

Overall, the unique multi-scale progressive sampling and tower ensemble approach allows capturing subtle motions and patterns over different durations. The strong results across diverse datasets with detailed ablations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing research. The large-scale evaluation also shows the generalization capability.
