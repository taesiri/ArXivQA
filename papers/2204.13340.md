# [The Wisdom of Crowds: Temporal Progressive Attention for Early Action   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively predict actions early from partially observed videos. The key ideas and hypotheses are:

- Modeling the temporal evolution of actions through progressively larger video scales is better suited for early prediction compared to using a single scale. 

- Utilizing multiple transformer towers, one per scale, to attend to fine-to-coarse representations can effectively model the ongoing action. 

- Aggregating predictions from these towers by considering their confidence and collective agreement can further improve early action prediction.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a temporally progressive multi-scale representation combined with transformer towers and adaptive aggregation leads to improved performance on early action prediction from partially observed videos. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across datasets and backbones.
