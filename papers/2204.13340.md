# [The Wisdom of Crowds: Temporal Progressive Attention for Early Action   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively predict actions early from partially observed videos. The key ideas and hypotheses are:

- Modeling the temporal evolution of actions through progressively larger video scales is better suited for early prediction compared to using a single scale. 

- Utilizing multiple transformer towers, one per scale, to attend to fine-to-coarse representations can effectively model the ongoing action. 

- Aggregating predictions from these towers by considering their confidence and collective agreement can further improve early action prediction.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a temporally progressive multi-scale representation combined with transformer towers and adaptive aggregation leads to improved performance on early action prediction from partially observed videos. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across datasets and backbones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a temporally progressive attention model called TemPr for early action prediction. The key ideas are:

- Using multiple scales (fine to coarse temporal segments) of the partially observed video as input to capture the evolution of actions over different durations. 

- Employing multiple transformer attention towers, one for each scale, to model features and make predictions. Towers attend to features using a cross-attention bottleneck and stacked self-attention blocks.

- Aggregating predictions from the towers by considering both the agreement between tower predictions and their individual confidences. 

- Showcasing state-of-the-art performance on early action prediction across multiple datasets (UCF-101, Epic Kitchens, NTU-RGB, Something-Something) and encoder architectures.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way of representing partial videos using progressive scales and modeling them with transformer towers for early action prediction. The tower predictions are aggregated adaptively based on agreement and confidence. This approach achieves strong results across diverse datasets compared to prior work.
