# [Multicoated and Folded Graph Neural Networks with Strong Lottery Tickets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03236)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes enhancements to apply the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) to both shallow and deep graph neural networks (GNNs). For shallow GNNs, the authors utilize a multicoated supermask (M-Sup) method with an adaptive threshold strategy that outperforms prior SLTH techniques and matches the accuracy of dense baseline models without any weight training. For deep GNNs, the paper demonstrates the existence of untrained recurrent subnetworks that achieve comparable performance to trained feedforward models. Additionally, multi-stage folding and unshared mask methods are introduced to expand the search space for optimized deep GNN architectures. Evaluations on various datasets and models show the feasibility of attaining high sparsity (up to 98.7%), competitive accuracy, and significant memory reductions using the proposed SLTH approach for GNNs. Key benefits include suitability for efficient SpMM hardware implementations and on-the-fly weight generation. By establishing strict win-win scenarios across accuracy, performance and efficiency, this research enables the applicability of SLTH to energy-efficient graph analytics.
