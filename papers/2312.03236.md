# [Multicoated and Folded Graph Neural Networks with Strong Lottery Tickets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03236)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes enhancements to apply the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) to both shallow and deep graph neural networks (GNNs). For shallow GNNs, the authors utilize a multicoated supermask (M-Sup) method with an adaptive threshold strategy that outperforms prior SLTH techniques and matches the accuracy of dense baseline models without any weight training. For deep GNNs, the paper demonstrates the existence of untrained recurrent subnetworks that achieve comparable performance to trained feedforward models. Additionally, multi-stage folding and unshared mask methods are introduced to expand the search space for optimized deep GNN architectures. Evaluations on various datasets and models show the feasibility of attaining high sparsity (up to 98.7%), competitive accuracy, and significant memory reductions using the proposed SLTH approach for GNNs. Key benefits include suitability for efficient SpMM hardware implementations and on-the-fly weight generation. By establishing strict win-win scenarios across accuracy, performance and efficiency, this research enables the applicability of SLTH to energy-efficient graph analytics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes methods to find high-performing subnetworks in graph neural networks using the strong lottery ticket hypothesis, without any weight training, achieving competitive accuracy and high memory efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It identifies a significant performance improvement in GNNs using multicoated supermasks (M-Sup) with randomly initialized weights, surpassing previous strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) methods like UGT and achieving higher accuracy than dense-weight trained baseline models without any weight training.

2. It proposes an adaptive strategy to determine pruning thresholds for M-Sup based on analyzing the weight score distributions of different GNN models.

3. It demonstrates the existence of untrained recurrent graph subnetworks within deep GNNs that exhibit comparable performance to their trained feedforward counterparts. 

4. It introduces the Multi-Stage Folding (MSF) and Unshared Mask methods to expand the search space for optimized deep GNNs, achieving significant memory reductions of 72-98.7% while maintaining accuracy comparable to baseline models.

In summary, the main contribution is using multicoated supermasks and folding techniques to uncover high-performing untrained subnetworks in both shallow and deep GNNs under the strong lottery ticket hypothesis, leading to models with competitive accuracy and high memory efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH): The hypothesis that an overparameterized neural network contains subnetworks ("winning tickets") that can achieve comparable accuracy to the original network without any training, found solely through pruning.

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Neural network architectures designed for graph-structured data, utilizing message passing and weight sharing schemes. Key GNN models mentioned include GCN, GAT, GIN, ResGCNs.

- Multicoated Supermasks (M-Sup): A pruning method using multiple masks ("coats") with different sparsity levels to find winning lottery tickets. Proposed to be applied to GNNs. 

- Adaptive threshold: A proposed strategy to determine effective sparsity levels for M-Sup in GNNs, adapting based on the weight distribution. 

- Hidden-Folded GNNs: Converting a deep feedforward GNN (like ResGCN) into a shallow recurrent network using residual connections and "folding".

- Multi-Stage Folding (MSF): Expanding the foldable stages to create more network structure diversity.  

- Unshared masks: Using individual supermasks per iteration instead of shared supermasks in folded GNNs.

- Node classification, graph classification: Two key graph learning tasks used for evaluation. Datasets include Cora, OGB.

In summary, the key focus is expanding SLTH techniques like M-Sup and folding to GNN architectures in order to find highly sparse yet accurate "winning tickets" without training.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Applying strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) to graph neural networks (GNNs) is challenging. Prior work using single-coated supermasks (S-Sup) shows discrepancies in performance compared to dense baseline models across different sparsity levels. Additionally, SLTH has not been explored for deep GNNs like ResGCNs, which suffer from high memory costs despite improved accuracy.  

Proposed Solution:
- Implements multicoated supermasks (M-Sup) in GNNs, which uses multiple pruning iterations to find winning lottery tickets. Proposes an adaptive strategy to set pruning thresholds for different score distributions.

- First work to show existence of untrained recurrent subnetworks in deep GNNs using folding techniques, attaining comparable accuracy to trained feedforward counterparts. Introduces multi-stage folding (MSF) and unshared masks to expand search space.

Main Contributions:  
- M-Sup surpasses S-Sup, achieving higher accuracy than dense baseline models without any weight training across shallow and deep GNNs like GCN, GAT, GIN, ResGCN+ and DyResGEN.

- Uncovers untrained recurrent graphs in ResGCN+ and DyResGEN using folding methods. MSF and unshared masks further improve performance. Models attain 72-98.7% memory reduction and comparable accuracy to original counterparts.

- Overall, establishes strong graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, competitive accuracy and extreme memory efficiency compared to dense models. Demonstrates suitability for efficient graph processing hardware.

In summary, the paper successfully tackles key challenges in applying SLTH to GNNs using novel M-Sup and folding techniques. The methods uncover high-performing sparse recurrent subnetworks with significant efficiency benefits.
