# Principled Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback from Pairwise or   $K$-wise Comparisons

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- What is the sample complexity for learning a reward model from pairwise or K-wise comparison data in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)?- Can we provide theoretical justification for the empirical success of existing RLHF algorithms like those used in InstructGPT? - How do different estimation algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and pessimistic MLE perform in terms of the quality of the induced policy? - Is MLE or its pessimistic variant sufficient to learn a good policy, or are additional algorithmic ideas needed?- For K-wise comparisons, how do the true MLE and an alternative MLE based on splitting into pairwise comparisons compare in terms of sample complexity and asymptotic efficiency?- Can the analysis be extended to the MDP setting and connected with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)?So in summary, the main goals seem to be:1) Establishing sample complexity bounds for reward learning in RLHF under different comparison models 2) Understanding the theoretical properties of different estimation algorithms like MLE and pessimistic MLE3) Providing a theoretical basis for design choices in existing RLHF systems4) Drawing connections between RLHF and IRL and extending the analysis to MDPsThe overall aim appears to be developing a theoretical understanding of reward learning in RLHF using comparisons, in order to explain the practical success and guide algorithm design. Let me know if I have correctly identified the main research questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the summary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:- Providing a theoretical framework and analysis for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Specifically, analyzing the sample complexity and performance of different estimation methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and pessimistic MLE when learning rewards from pairwise or K-wise comparisons.- Showing that MLE converges for reward learning under both the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and Plackett-Luce (PL) models. However, MLE can fail to produce good policies, while pessimistic MLE gives improved policies under certain coverage assumptions. - Analyzing MLE and an alternative "split" MLE for K-wise comparisons under the PL model. Showing they both converge, but MLE is asymptotically more statistically efficient.- Extending the results to Markov Decision Processes and providing sample complexity analyses for trajectory-based and action-based comparisons.- Unifying the problem with max-entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning and providing the first sample complexity bound for it.- Providing theoretical justification for design choices in existing RLHF algorithms like InstructGPT, and suggesting algorithmic improvements like using pessimism.In summary, the main contribution seems to be a comprehensive theoretical analysis of reward learning in RLHF that helps explain the empirical success of methods like InstructGPT, and provides guidance for further algorithm development.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in reinforcement learning with human feedback:- This paper provides a theoretical analysis of reward learning from human feedback, with a focus on pairwise and K-wise comparisons. Much prior work on reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has been empirical in nature, so this paper helps provide a theoretical foundation.- The paper connects RLHF to the literature on dueling bandits, ranking/preference learning, and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). It builds on results from these fields to provide sample complexity bounds and justify the success of methods like maximum likelihood estimation. - The analysis of the maximum likelihood estimator and justification for incorporating pessimism aligns with trends in offline RL research. The paper makes an explicit connection between the need for pessimism in RLHF and offline RL.- For K-wise comparisons, the paper analyzes both directly modeling the K-wise probabilities and splitting into pairwise comparisons. This sheds light on the tradeoffs of different modeling choices made in practice.- The results help explain the empirical success of existing RLHF algorithms like those used in InstructGPT and provide guidance for algorithm design. For example, the importance of pessimism and the efficiency of direct K-wise modeling.- The focus on linear function approximation and sample complexity bounds differs from most of the empirical RLHF literature, which uses complex function approximators like neural networks. This provides a useful theoretical complement.Overall, the paper helps formalize the problem of reward learning from comparisons and provides fresh theoretical insights that relate to and build upon several bodies of prior work. The analysis seems novel in rigorously studying RLHF sample complexity and connecting it to related fields.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the theoretical analysis to cover the whole training pipeline of pre-training the policy, learning the reward model, and fine-tuning the policy with policy gradient/PPO. The current analysis mainly focuses on the reward learning aspect.- Generalizing the analysis to other behavioral models beyond BTL and PL, such as the Thurstone model and cardinal utility models. - Exploring the theoretical guarantees and algorithm design for online (active) learning settings when active queries are allowed, as opposed to the offline setting studied in this paper.- Studying the theoretical properties when the feature mapping Ï† is not fixed but slowly changes during fine-tuning. - Connecting the theory to the practical heuristic approximations for implementing pessimism with neural network policies, such as constrained policy optimization.- Extending the theoretical analysis to the setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which is more complex than the contextual bandits studied here.- Providing finite sample analysis for other forms of Inverse Reinforcement Learning like maximum entropy IRL.- Considering nonlinear reward functions beyond the linear rewards assumed in this paper.- Analyzing the sample complexity for learning with other behavioral models such as the Thurstone model.- Exploring the benefits of having access to demonstration data in the form of full trajectories, in addition to comparison data.So in summary, the main directions are: connecting theory to practice, generalizing the analysis to broader settings, and incorporating ideas from adjacent fields like active learning, offline RL, and IRL.
