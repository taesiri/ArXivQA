# [Pre-training Language Model as a Multi-perspective Course Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03981)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we enhance the sample efficiency and performance of ELECTRA-style pre-training frameworks through multi-perspective learning?Specifically, the authors aim to address two key challenges with the standard ELECTRA pre-training:1) Monotonous training and biased learning due to reliance solely on masked language modeling (MLM).2) Deficient interaction between the generator and discriminator components due to lack of an explicit feedback loop. To address these issues, the paper proposes a multi-perspective course learning (MCL) method with:1) Three self-supervision courses (cloze test, word rearrangement, slot detection) to treat data from diverse angles.2) Two self-correction courses to create a "correction notebook" for secondary supervised learning. The central hypothesis is that mining data multi-perspectively can enhance sample efficiency and mitigate the flaws of MLM-based ELECTRA pre-training. The experiments aim to validate whether MCL can significantly boost ELECTRA's performance on downstream tasks.In summary, the key research question is whether multi-perspective learning can improve sample efficiency and effectiveness of ELECTRA-style pre-training frameworks. The paper proposes and evaluates the MCL method to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Multi-perspective Course Learning (MCL) for more efficient pre-training of language models in the ELECTRA framework. Specifically:- It proposes three new self-supervision tasks (swapped token detection, inserted token detection, and slot detection) on top of the standard replaced token detection in ELECTRA. These provide different perspectives on the data to improve learning.- It introduces two self-correction tasks that create a "correction notebook" to provide secondary supervision for the generator and discriminator based on analysis of the errors made in the first round of training. This helps bridge the gap between the two components. - Experiments show the proposed MCL method substantially improves performance over ELECTRA across a range of GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness for more sample-efficient pre-training.In summary, the key contribution is presenting a multi-perspective learning approach via new self-supervision and self-correction tasks to address issues like biased learning and deficient interaction in standard ELECTRA training. This results in better pre-trained models using the same amount of data.
