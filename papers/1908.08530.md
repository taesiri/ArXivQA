# [VL-BERT: Pre-training of Generic Visual-Linguistic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08530)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop a pre-trainable generic visual-linguistic representation that can benefit various downstream visual-linguistic tasks. The key hypotheses are:1) A unified architecture based on Transformers, taking both visual and linguistic elements as input, can effectively aggregate and align multi-modal information.2) Pre-training such a model on large-scale visual-linguistic and text-only corpora can sharpen its capability of aggregating and aligning visual-linguistic clues.3) The pre-trained model can serve as a generic representation for various downstream visual-linguistic tasks. Fine-tuning the pre-trained model with task-specific formatting and objectives can achieve superior performance on tasks like visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and referring expression comprehension.In summary, the central research question is how to develop a generic visual-linguistic representation via pre-training. The key hypotheses are around using a unified Transformer-based architecture and pre-training it on both visual-linguistic and text corpora. The pre-trained model is expected to benefit various downstream tasks through simple fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the LaTeX code provided, this appears to be a paper introducing VL-BERT, a new pre-trainable generic representation for visual-linguistic tasks. The main contributions seem to be:- Proposing VL-BERT, which is based on the Transformer model and takes both visual and linguistic embedded features as input. - Pre-training VL-BERT on large visual-linguistic and text-only corpora, using masked language modeling and masked ROI classification tasks.- Showing through experiments that VL-BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream visual-linguistic tasks like visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and referring expression comprehension.- Demonstrating that the model benefits from pre-training to align visual and linguistic clues.- Achieving first place on the leaderboard for visual commonsense reasoning among single models.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing VL-BERT and showing its effectiveness as a pre-trained model for various visual-linguistic tasks through strong experimental results. The pre-training approach seems key to aligning visual and text data.
