# [QUICK: Quantization-aware Interleaving and Conflict-free Kernel for   efficient LLM inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10076)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are growing in size for better performance, needing hundreds of billions of parameters. This requires model compression techniques like quantization and pruning. 
- Weight-only quantization reduces memory usage and accelerates computation by quantizing weights to lower precision while keeping activations at higher precision. This needs fast mixed-precision GEMM kernels.  
- Existing mixed-precision GEMM kernels have limitations in throughput due to overhead from weight dequantization. Analysis shows shared memory bank conflicts during dequantization are a major bottleneck.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce QUICK - optimized CUDA kernels to mitigate shared memory bank conflicts for efficient quantized LLM inference.
- Interleave quantized weight matrices offline to skip shared memory write-back after dequantization. This enhances memory locality of weights and eliminates bank conflicts.
- Additional reordering based on dequantization kernel pattern is done to reduce rearrangement overhead. 
- Increase tile size to reduce DRAM accesses since shared memory usage is reduced.

Main Contributions:
- Propose interleaved data pattern for weights that aligns with ldmatrix instruction to bypass it and avoid associated overheads.
- Demonstrate up to 1.91x speedup over AutoAWQ kernels on larger batches and up to 1.94x throughput gain on representative LLM models on NVIDIA GPUs.
- Show superior performance of QUICK integrated with AutoAWQ and vLLM frameworks for quantized LLM inference.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective solution called QUICK to address performance bottlenecks in mixed-precision GEMM kernels by avoiding shared memory bank conflicts. This enables more efficient deployment of quantized LLMs.
