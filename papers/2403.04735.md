# [SnapNTell: Enhancing Entity-Centric Visual Question Answering with   Retrieval Augmented Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-extended large language models (VLLMs) have shown promise for visual question answering (VQA) but still struggle with queries involving long-tail, obscure entities. They tend to produce erroneous or hallucinated responses.  
- Existing VQA datasets are inadequate to evaluate models' ability to recognize entities and provide factual, entity-specific responses. They lack fine-grained entity categories, entity mentions in answers, and knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce SnapNTell - a new entity-centric VQA task to test models on entity recognition and detailed, accurate responses.
- Develop SnapNTell dataset with 22 categories, 7,568 unique entities, 10 images per entity, 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs per entity image. Entities explicitly named in answers.
- Propose scalable, efficient, transparent retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM baseline for SnapNTell task. Retrieves entity info to reduce hallucinations.

Key Contributions:
- Novel SnapNTell task for assessing entity-centric VQA abilities.
- Distinctive SnapNTell dataset with categorized fine-grained entities, entity-specific images, and knowledge-intensive QA pairs.  
- High-performing retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM approach that exceeds prior methods by 66.5% on new dataset.
- Analysis shows retrieval augmentation significantly boosts performance, especially for less popular tail entities.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed SnapNTell solution, the new dataset introduced, the high-level approach of the multimodal LLM model, and the main results showing performance improvements over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new visual question answering task and dataset focused on evaluating models' abilities to recognize entities in images and provide detailed, factual responses, and proposes a retrieval-augmented multimodal language model approach that outperforms existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new entity-centric visual question answering (VQA) task called SnapNTell, designed to test models' ability to recognize entities in images and provide detailed, knowledgeable responses about those entities. 

2. Creating a new dataset for the SnapNTell task that has a wide range of fine-grained, categorized entities with corresponding images and knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs. The answers explicitly mention entity names.

3. Devising a scalable, effective, and explainable retrieval-augmented multimodal large language model (LLM) as a strong baseline model for the SnapNTell task. It incorporates retrieval of external knowledge to enhance entity understanding.

4. Demonstrating superior performance of the proposed SnapNTell model over existing methods on the new SnapNTell dataset, with significant improvements of 66.5% in BELURT score.

In summary, the key highlights are proposing the novel SnapNTell task and dataset to assess entity-centric VQA abilities, and developing a retrieval-based multimodal LLM method that shows top results on this benchmark.
