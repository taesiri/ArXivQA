# [SnapNTell: Enhancing Entity-Centric Visual Question Answering with   Retrieval Augmented Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-extended large language models (VLLMs) have shown promise for visual question answering (VQA) but still struggle with queries involving long-tail, obscure entities. They tend to produce erroneous or hallucinated responses.  
- Existing VQA datasets are inadequate to evaluate models' ability to recognize entities and provide factual, entity-specific responses. They lack fine-grained entity categories, entity mentions in answers, and knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce SnapNTell - a new entity-centric VQA task to test models on entity recognition and detailed, accurate responses.
- Develop SnapNTell dataset with 22 categories, 7,568 unique entities, 10 images per entity, 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs per entity image. Entities explicitly named in answers.
- Propose scalable, efficient, transparent retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM baseline for SnapNTell task. Retrieves entity info to reduce hallucinations.

Key Contributions:
- Novel SnapNTell task for assessing entity-centric VQA abilities.
- Distinctive SnapNTell dataset with categorized fine-grained entities, entity-specific images, and knowledge-intensive QA pairs.  
- High-performing retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM approach that exceeds prior methods by 66.5% on new dataset.
- Analysis shows retrieval augmentation significantly boosts performance, especially for less popular tail entities.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed SnapNTell solution, the new dataset introduced, the high-level approach of the multimodal LLM model, and the main results showing performance improvements over existing methods.
