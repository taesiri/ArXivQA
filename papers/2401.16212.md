# [Better Call GPT, Comparing Large Language Models Against Lawyers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of research comparing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) against human lawyers in determining and locating legal issues in contracts. Such research is needed to evaluate if LLMs can match lawyers in accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency for high-volume legal tasks like contract review. 

Methodology:
- The paper conducts an empirical analysis by benchmarking LLMs against Junior Lawyers and Legal Process Outsourcers (LPOs) on real-world procurement contracts. 
- Senior Lawyers establish ground truth by reviewing contracts and identifying legal issues.
- Metrics analyzed include precision, recall, F1-score for issue determination and location, time per review, and cost per review.
- Models tested include GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Palm2, Claude 2.0, Claude 2.1.

Key Findings:
- LLMs match or exceed human accuracy for determining legal issues. GPT-4 achieves the top F1-score of 0.87.
- LPOs edge out LLMs for locating issues within contracts (F1 of 0.77 vs. 0.74). 
- LLMs complete reviews much faster than humans. The fastest LLM takes 45-138x less time than lawyers/LPOs.
- Average cost per review is up to 99.97% lower for LLMs compared to lawyers/LPOs.

Contributions:
- First empirical evaluation showing LLMs can match lawyers in determining legal issues.
- Analysis of LLMs' precision in locating contractual language related to issues. 
- Revelations of immense efficiency gains from LLMs in contract review time and cost.
- Quantification of coming disruption to legal industry as LLMs stand poised to transform legal workflows.

In summary, this is a pioneering study providing evidence that LLMs have attained sophistication comparable to human lawyers for legal tasks like contract review. The paper argues LLMs will disrupt the legal industry by enhancing accessibility and efficiency of legal services.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an empirical analysis benchmarking Large Language Models against human legal practitioners in determining and locating legal issues in contracts, finding that advanced models match or exceed human accuracy while operating at a fraction of the cost and time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is:

This paper presents an empirical analysis benchmarking the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) against human legal practitioners - specifically Junior Lawyers and Legal Process Outsourcers (LPOs) - on legal contract review tasks. Through a detailed experimental evaluation on real-world procurement contracts, the study compares the accuracy, speed, and cost efficiency of leading LLMs such as Claude, GPT-3, and Palm against human performance. 

The key findings show that advanced LLMs can match or even exceed the accuracy of Junior Lawyers and LPOs in determining legal issues, while massively outpacing them in speed (by over 200x) and providing staggering cost reductions of 99.97\% over traditional methods.

The implications are that LLMs stand poised to disrupt legal services, offering enhanced accessibility, efficiency, and scalability. The study asserts that the era of LLM dominance in routine legal work like contract reviews is already upon us, challenging status quo practices in the legal industry. Overall, this benchmarking analysis makes vital contributions in demonstrating and quantifying the capabilities of LLMs versus humans on practical legal tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a "contract review playbook" derived from real-world examples to structure the analysis. Can you provide more details on the specific contents of this playbook and how it was developed? What were some of the key criteria or checklist items it contained?

2. In establishing ground truth, what quality assurance measures were put in place to ensure consistency and minimize bias among the Senior Lawyer assessments? Were any statistical tests for inter-rater reliability performed? 

3. The paper states that contract data was collected from 10 procurement agreements. What was the rationale for selecting procurement agreements specifically? Would the findings generalize to other contract types like NDAs or service agreements?

4. What considerations went into determining the appropriate context window size for the LLM models? Were any experiments done with smaller or larger context sizes to validate the chosen value of 16,000 tokens?

5. The prompt engineering process is a key aspect of configuring LLMs properly. Can you describe in more detail the iterative process involved in developing and testing the prompts for each model? What major changes or optimizations were made through this process?

6. Were there any criteria aside from context window size that led to excluding Amazon Titan and LLaMA2 models from the analysis? What limitations did you observe with those models?

7. For the statistical analysis, why was Cronbach's Alpha specifically selected to measure inter-annotator agreement over other metrics like Cohen's Kappa? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this metric?

8. The cost analysis highlights a stark difference between human reviewers and LLMs. However, what additional infrastructure, maintenance or human oversight costs may be associated with operating LLMs at scale? 

9. What techniques could be employed during training data collection and model development to minimize the type of inaccuracies illustrated in Table 5? Are there certain augmentation strategies focused on legal semantics?

10. For real world deployment, what qualitative or quantitative testing procedures would you recommend organizations apply on top of the benchmarking done in this study to validate performance for their specific use cases?
