# [Opening the Black-Box: A Systematic Review on Explainable AI in Remote   Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13791)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (xAI) for remote sensing applications. The key problem addressed is that while machine learning, especially deep learning, has become the dominant approach for knowledge extraction from remote sensing data, these models are complex black boxes lacking interpretability. xAI methods are needed to explain their predictions and uncover model biases, ensure trustworthiness for policy decisions, debug models, and gain scientific insights. 

The authors first introduce a taxonomy and categorization of different xAI methods based on how explanations are generated - for example, backpropagation methods that highlight important input features versus prototype methods that classify based on similarity to prototype examples. They also categorize methods as model-specific versus model-agnostic, local versus global, and ante-hoc versus post-hoc.

A systematic literature review is then conducted spanning over 200 papers on xAI for remote sensing in areas like landcover monitoring, agriculture, natural hazards, climate, and more. The analysis reveals that perturbation and local approximation methods are most widely used, with SHAP being the single most common method. An increasing number of papers also adapt xAI methods to handle properties of remote sensing data.

The interpretations, evaluations, objectives and findings of applying xAI in remote sensing are summarized. The paper discusses alignment with recommended xAI practices like using multiple seeds and methods. Key challenges are highlighted - remote sensing properties like scale and topology, lack of labels, standardized evaluation, and needs for intrinsically interpretable models.

In conclusion, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of research in xAI for remote sensing, revealing usage patterns, interpretations, adaptations, evaluations and objectives. It offers insights into limitations and promising future directions to develop tailored xAI methods for remote sensing tasks.
