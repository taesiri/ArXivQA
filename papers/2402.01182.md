# [In-Context Learning for Few-Shot Nested Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Nested named entity recognition (NER) is more complex than flat NER as it allows nested, overlapping entities. This requires more annotated data which is expensive. Thus, few-shot learning methods are needed.  
- The key challenge is selecting good demonstration examples for the in-context learning (ICL) prompt to properly guide the language model's predictions. The examples need high semantic similarity, boundary similarity, and differentiation of labels between nested entities.

Proposed Solution:
- An end-to-end framework for few-shot nested NER using ICL with a novel Entity Demonstration (EnDe) retriever.
- EnDe retrieves high quality ICL examples using contrastive learning to maximize semantic similarity, boundary similarity and label differentiation. 
- Three losses are defined: 1) semantic similarity between sentence representations, 2) boundary similarity using POS and syntax trees, 3) label similarity to pull together same labels and push apart overlapping mentions.

Main Contributions:
- A new state-of-the-art approach for few-shot nested NER using ICL and a tailored demonstration retriever.
- EnDe retriever with contrastive learning losses for semantic, boundary and label based example selection.
- Extensive experiments on 3 nested and 4 flat NER datasets prove the efficacy of the framework, especially in low-shot scenarios.
- Analysis of different LM backbones reveals large models like GPT-3.5 can further boost performance.

In summary, the key novelty is the EnDe retriever to select optimal ICL examples for few-shot nested NER using contrastive representation learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces an in-context learning framework for few-shot nested named entity recognition that improves prompt examples using an EnDe retriever based on contrastive learning for semantic, boundary, and label similarity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an innovative in-context learning (ICL) framework to address few-shot nested named entity recognition (NER). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Devising a novel Entity Demonstration (EnDe) retriever mechanism that selects high-quality demonstration examples for the ICL prompt. It employs contrastive learning to perform representation learning based on semantic similarity, boundary similarity, and label similarity between examples. 

2) Improving the ICL prompt template by incorporating task instructions, demonstrations with boundary features, label set, and testing sentence.

3) Conducting comprehensive experiments on 3 nested NER and 4 flat NER datasets. Results show the proposed approach consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the efficacy of the framework, especially in low-shot scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an effective ICL-based framework tailored for few-shot nested NER by carefully designing the prompt and selecting informative demonstrations. Both qualitative analysis and empirical results validate the advance of the proposed system.
