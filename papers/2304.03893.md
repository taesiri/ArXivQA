# ChatGPT Empowered Long-Step Robot Control in Various Environments: A
  Case Application

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can OpenAI's ChatGPT be utilized for translating multi-step natural language instructions into executable robot action sequences? The key hypothesis is that by designing appropriate input prompts for ChatGPT, it can be adapted to:1) Translate multi-step instructions into robot actions. 2) Be applicable across diverse environments and scenarios.3) Enable conversational feedback from users to adjust outputs.4) Account for token limits when handling multi-step instructions.In essence, the paper explores whether ChatGPT can serve as an effective tool for robot task planning from natural language instructions when provided with suitable prompting strategies tailored to this application. The prompts are designed to meet common requirements in practical robotics settings.
