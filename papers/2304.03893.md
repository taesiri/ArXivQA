# ChatGPT Empowered Long-Step Robot Control in Various Environments: A
  Case Application

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can OpenAI's ChatGPT be utilized for translating multi-step natural language instructions into executable robot action sequences? The key hypothesis is that by designing appropriate input prompts for ChatGPT, it can be adapted to:1) Translate multi-step instructions into robot actions. 2) Be applicable across diverse environments and scenarios.3) Enable conversational feedback from users to adjust outputs.4) Account for token limits when handling multi-step instructions.In essence, the paper explores whether ChatGPT can serve as an effective tool for robot task planning from natural language instructions when provided with suitable prompting strategies tailored to this application. The prompts are designed to meet common requirements in practical robotics settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing practical prompts for ChatGPT to enable it to translate multi-step natural language instructions into executable robot action sequences. The key aspects of the contribution are:- The paper designs prompts to meet common requirements in robotics applications: easy integration with robot systems, applicability across environments, and handling multi-step instructions within ChatGPT's token limit. - The prompts encourage ChatGPT to output robot actions in an easy-to-parse JSON format, explicitly represent environment states, and estimate post-operation environments to facilitate multi-step planning.- Experiments demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to produce valid action sequences for multi-step instructions in various household environments after a few rounds of natural language feedback from users.- The prompts serve as customizable templates that can be adapted for different robot platforms and environments. The code is open source to provide practical resources to the robotics research community.In summary, the key contribution is designing and validating prompts that enable ChatGPT to act as an executable robot task planner for multi-step instructions across diverse environments, with the code/templates made publicly available to benefit robotics research. The human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism also contributes to safe and robust planning.
