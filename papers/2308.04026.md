# AgentSims: An Open-Source Sandbox for Large Language Model Evaluation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we develop an easy-to-use infrastructure for researchers from various backgrounds to build and test task-based evaluation environments for large language models (LLMs)?The key hypotheses implied in the paper are:1) Task-based evaluation in simulated environments is a comprehensive and robust approach to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs, compared to existing benchmark datasets.2) Creating such simulated environments requires combining LLMs with support systems like planning, memory, and tool use. 3) An interactive, visual interface can lower the barriers for non-experts from various fields to get involved in building simulated environments and tasks for LLM evaluation.4) Modular software architecture and abstractions can enable flexibility for researchers to customize agents and environments.The authors argue that existing LLM benchmarks have limitations in constrained evaluation abilities, vulnerability to cheating, language-dependence, and subjective metrics. They propose task-based evaluation in simulated social environments as a more comprehensive solution, and introduce the AgentSims software to facilitate building such environments. The key hypotheses are that AgentSims enables more researchers to create better LLM benchmarks through its interactive interface, modular architecture, and integrated agent simulation capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting AgentSims, an interactive, visualized, and program-based infrastructure for curating evaluation tasks for large language models (LLMs). The key points are:- AgentSims creates an artificial town with residents (agents) and buildings/equipment, allowing researchers to construct social simulation tasks to evaluate LLMs. - It provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for non-expert users to design tasks by adding agents and buildings.- It also allows developers to customize agents and support systems (planning, memory, tool use) through Python APIs for advanced experimentation. - AgentSims aims to facilitate researchers from all disciplines to effectively build benchmark tasks for evaluating LLMs. It lowers the barrier for collaboration between fields.- The interactive interface and modular implementation make AgentSims user-friendly and extensible. It also ensures reproducibility of results.- AgentSims supports evaluating LLMs both as participants in a social simulation and as mayors/leaders organizing the town. It enables testing a wide range of capabilities.- Beyond evaluation, AgentSims can also be used for social science research and generating training data through simulated social interactions.In summary, AgentSims contributes an open, flexible platform for the LLM community to construct and share simulation-based evaluation tasks across different fields of study.
