# mPLUG-DocOwl: Modularized Multimodal Large Language Model for Document   Understanding

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we enhance the document understanding capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like mPLUG-Owl in an open-ended setting without relying on OCR?The authors propose a new model called mPLUG-DocOwl that aims to improve the OCR-free document understanding abilities of MLLMs through unified instruction tuning on diverse document understanding datasets. Specifically, the key hypotheses tested in this paper are:1) By constructing a diverse instruction tuning dataset covering various document understanding tasks and training mPLUG-Owl on it, the model can gain stronger OCR-free document understanding abilities while maintaining its general vision-and-language capabilities. 2) The proposed mPLUG-DocOwl will outperform existing MLLMs like mPLUG-Owl and MiniGPT-4 in document understanding when evaluated on both standard benchmarks and their newly collected LLMDoc test set.3) mPLUG-DocOwl will achieve state-of-the-art performance on OCR-free document understanding benchmarks compared to prior non-LLM methods.In summary, the main research question is how to enhance OCR-free document understanding for MLLMs through unified instruction tuning, which is evaluated by testing the above hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a modularized multimodal large language model called mPLUG-DocOwl for OCR-free document understanding. 2. Constructing an instruction tuning dataset featuring diverse visual-text understanding tasks to enhance the model's document understanding capabilities.3. Building an instruction understanding test set called LLMDoc with human evaluation to assess document understanding performance. 4. Showing through experiments that mPLUG-DocOwl outperforms existing multimodal models on document understanding benchmarks and the LLMDoc evaluation set.5. Demonstrating that mPLUG-DocOwl generalizes well to various downstream tasks without specific fine-tuning.In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating mPLUG-DocOwl, a modularized multimodal LLM tailored for document understanding through unified instruction tuning across different modalities and tasks. The new LLMDoc benchmark is also an important contribution for evaluating instruction understanding abilities in the document domain.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper summary, here is a one sentence TL;DR: The paper proposes a new modularized multimodal large language model called mPLUG-DocOwl, which is trained on a diverse set of document understanding data and demonstrates stronger document understanding abilities compared to existing models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the paper, here are some key ways this research compares to other work in document understanding:- The proposed model, mPLUG-DocOwl, is built on top of the mPLUG-Owl architecture. This follows the trend of adapting large multimodal language models for document tasks. Other models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA have also been proposed. - A key contribution is the construction of a diverse instruction tuning dataset for document understanding. This allows mPLUG-DocOwl to gain stronger capabilities on tables, charts, documents etc compared to mPLUG-Owl and other models. - The paper introduces a new human evaluation benchmark called LLMDoc to directly assess instruction following and document understanding. On this, mPLUG-DocOwl outperforms mPLUG-Owl and MiniGPT-4.- Without fine-tuning, mPLUG-DocOwl achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several standard document understanding benchmarks including DocVQA, InfoVQA, TabFact etc. This demonstrates its generalization ability.- The results show mPLUG-DocOwl still struggles with some complex reasoning and generation tasks. This points to limitations of current methods and areas for improvement.Overall, the key novelty seems to be in training the model on a diverse document-focused dataset and evaluating on the new LLMDoc benchmark. The results demonstrate mPLUG-DocOwl's stronger document understanding abilities compared to previous multimodal LLMs, while maintaining generalizability. Key limitations and future work are also highlighted.
