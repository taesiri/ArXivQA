## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a compositional inversion method to address the issue of inverted concepts dominating and encroaching upon other concepts during image generation. The authors discover that textual inversion leads concepts to be out-of-distribution and incompatible with other concepts. They introduce two components - semantic inversion to guide the search towards the core distribution, and spatial inversion to regularize attention maps and prevent dominance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach mitigates overfitting and generates more balanced and diverse compositions. Specifically, it improves the coherence and presence of concepts of interest by over 100% when combined with pretrained concepts and by over 20% for inverted concept combinations, with only a small trade-off in similarity to user images. Additional analysis also reveals the varying degrees of concept compositionality and the convergence of inverted concepts towards pretrained ones. In summary, this paper puts forth an effective post-training solution to enhance concept composability in conditional image synthesis.
