# [Activating Wider Areas in Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. Despite recent progress with CNNs and vision transformers, existing methods still fail to fully restore fine details and textures. 

- Two key limitations were identified:
  1) Simply stacking blocks or using a single attention mechanism is insufficient.
  2) Existing methods activate only restricted areas of the input, limiting performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new SR network called MMA based on the Vision Mamba (Vim) state space model to address the above limitations. 

- Three key strategies are used to better utilize Vim:
  1) Incorporate Vim into a MetaFormer-style block instead of simply replacing CNN blocks.
  2) Pre-train Vim on ImageNet to enhance its representations.
  3) Use complementary channel attention in parallel with Vim to enlarge activated areas.

- Together, these allow MMA to find the most relevant input pixels to reconstruct HR images.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring Vim-based models for image SR. Provides recipes to effectively utilize Vim.

- MMA outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and scales, with up to +0.5dB PSNR gains. Uses fewer parameters than comparables.

- Analysis shows MMA activates significantly wider input areas, correlating to its enhanced performance.

- Demonstrates Vim models can achieve new SOTA in image processing tasks. Opens up exploration of SSMs for other image processing challenges.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative Vim-based SR network with complementary attention that achieves leading quantitative and qualitative performance by activating wider input areas. This exploration of Vim for image SR illuminates the potential of SSMs within image processing.
