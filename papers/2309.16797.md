# [Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement Via Prompt Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16797)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a general-purpose, self-referential system that can automatically improve prompts for large language models (LLMs) in a given domain?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Prompts can be thought of as the "program" that controls the behavior of LLMs. Therefore, evolving better prompts is akin to evolving better programs. 

2) By using the LLM itself to generate variations and improvements to prompts over multiple generations, the system can self-referentially adapt prompts to the problem domain.

3) This approach of prompt evolution and self-referential self-improvement will outperform existing hand-engineered prompting strategies that are not adaptive.

4) Prompt evolution will continue to be effective and scale well as LLMs get larger, since it does not require updating the model parameters.

So in summary, the central research question is how to create an automated system for prompt engineering that leverages the power of LLMs themselves and can self-improve over time. The key hypothesis is that this self-referential approach will enable the system to find better prompts than human-designed strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing Promptbreeder, a self-referential self-improvement method for large language models (LLMs) that evolves prompts for a domain, as well as improves the way it evolves these prompts. 

2. Demonstrating improvements over state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods like Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve prompting on several common benchmark tasks involving arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and hate speech classification.

3. Showing that Promptbreeder is able to evolve complex prompt strategies adapted to a task, such as prompts for hate speech classification.

4. Avoiding costly parameter updates by using language itself as the substrate for self-improvement, making the approach scalable.

5. Analyzing the various self-referential components of Promptbreeder and their contribution to the results through ablation studies.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating a general-purpose, self-referential framework for automatically evolving better prompts and prompt mutation strategies for LLMs, without requiring parameter updates. The results demonstrate improved performance over prior prompt engineering methods on several benchmarks. The self-referential approach also points towards more open-ended self-improvement of LLMs grounded in language.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Promptbreeder, a method that evolves prompts and prompt mutation strategies over generations to automatically improve the reasoning and language capabilities of large language models on tasks in a self-referential way, outperforming prior state-of-the-art prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought on common benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in prompt engineering and self-improvement for large language models:

- The key novelty of this paper is evolving both task prompts and mutation prompts in a self-referential way, allowing the system to improve how it is improving prompts. This idea of meta-level evolution of the evolutionary process itself relates closely to ideas in self-referential weight matrices and GÃ¶del machines. However, this work implements the concept at the prompt level rather than the parameter level.

- Compared to other prompt engineering methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting or Automatic Prompt Engineer, this work takes a more open-ended evolutionary approach to prompt optimization. By coevolving populations of prompts and using multiple creative mutation operators, it can explore a wider range of prompt strategies compared to more constrained optimization or search.

- The idea of using the LLM itself to generate prompt variations is similar to recent work like Automatic Prompt Engineer. However, this paper introduces more diversity in the prompt mutation operators, as well as novelty like hypermutation of the mutation prompts themselves.

- For benchmark performance, this work shows state-of-the-art results on several reasoning datasets compared to prior prompting methods. The ability to evolve effective prompts on hate speech classification is also demonstrated.

- A limitation is the approach doesn't modify the prompting strategy/algorithm itself - only the prompt content evolves. Also, human oversight of the evolutionary process could further boost performance.

Overall, this work makes good progress on open-ended prompt evolution for LLMs by introducing self-referential coevolution of prompts and mutators. The benchmark results are competitive, while the approach could scale well as models grow. An exciting direction for future work is developing even richer prompt evolution strategies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating more complex "thought processes" with Promptbreeder, such as having it evolve conditional prompt strategies or prompts for self-play between LLM agents. The authors suggest this could lead to more open-ended, adaptive prompting strategies.

- Using the LLM itself to assess and promote diversity of the prompts generated by Promptbreeder. The authors note recent work showing LLMs can quantify novelty.

- Evolving prompts in a multi-modal setting, not just with natural language. The authors mention human thought involves things like intonation and imagery.

- Scaling up Promptbreeder with ever larger and more capable LLMs, since the approach does not require parameter updates for the self-improvement process.

- Developing more open-ended self-referential systems grounded in LLMs, where Promptbreeder is seen as a step in that direction. The authors contrast Promptbreeder's fixed topology for prompting with the reconfigurable, open-ended nature of human thought processes.

- Using fitness values directly during prompt evolution, as the authors found the LLM in Promptbreeder did not make effective use of explicit fitness scores.

- Exploring whether the gains from Promptbreeder could be combined with approaches that fine-tune or update parts of the LLM parameters.

So in summary, the main future directions relate to scaling up Promptbreeder, making it more open-ended and adaptive, incorporating multi-modality, and integrating it with other techniques like LLM fine-tuning when beneficial. The core idea is evolving more capable and general self-referential systems using LLMs as a substrate.
