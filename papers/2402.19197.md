# [Fine Structure-Aware Sampling: A New Sampling Training Scheme for   Pixel-Aligned Implicit Models in Single-View Human Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Existing pixel-aligned implicit models for single-view human reconstruction, such as PIFu, PIFuHD and IntegratedPIFu, use sampling training schemes that have limitations. Spatial sampling schemes fail to capture thin body surfaces like ears and fingers. The recently proposed Depth-Oriented Sampling (DOS) scheme captures thin surfaces but causes noisy artifacts on the meshes.

Proposed Solution - Fine Structure-aware Sampling (FSS):
The paper proposes a new sampling training scheme called Fine Structure-aware Sampling (FSS) that overcomes the limitations of prior schemes. FSS adapts sampling based on surface thickness and complexity. It uses concepts like twinned sample points, proximity-adaptive displacement, anchor points, counter points and SMPLX-guided sampling to focus sampling on hard-to-reconstruct thin features. 

Extensions to FSS:
1) Exploiting Normals of Sample Points (NSP) during training for better supervision.
2) Introducing a Mesh Thickness Loss (MTL) by modifying the architecture to predict mesh thickness from feature volumes.

Main Contributions:
1) A robust FSS scheme that captures thin body features without artifacts.
2) Demonstrating the usefulness of sample points' normals (NSP) for training.
3) A method to incorporate mesh thickness loss (MTL) into training.

The proposed FSS scheme and its extensions outperform state-of-the-art methods like PIFu, PIFuHD and IntegratedPIFu, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in reconstructing high quality human meshes from single images.
