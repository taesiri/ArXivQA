# [I Can't Believe It's Not Scene Flow!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current scene flow methods fail to accurately estimate motion of small, rare objects like pedestrians even though they seem to perform well on average error metrics. This is because average error metrics are dominated by large, common objects like cars.
- Standard evaluation protocols like Threeway EPE hide these failures by not providing class-specific or speed-normalized performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new evaluation protocol called \oureval{} that reports class-specific, speed-normalized errors to reveal performance on rare classes.
- Propose a simple but effective baseline scene flow method called \ourmethod{} that combines a top-performing detector with a basic tracker.

Key Contributions:

1. Reveal qualitative failures of state-of-the-art scene flow methods on small, rare objects through cherry-picked visualizations.

2. Propose \oureval{}, a class-aware, speed-normalized evaluation protocol that reveals poor performance of methods on pedestrians and other small objects.

3. Introduce \ourmethod, a strong baseline scene flow method that leverages a top detector and basic tracker to capture state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics and significantly outperform prior work on the proposed \oureval{} protocol.

4. Show that supervised scene flow methods need to address class imbalance issues by properly weighting rare classes, similar to how modern detectors handle class imbalance.

In summary, this paper clearly reveals deficiencies in current scene flow evaluation protocols and estimation methods when it comes to small, rare objects. The proposed solutions offer the community clear direction on improving evaluation and estimation quality for these critical object classes.
