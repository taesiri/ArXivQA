# [Black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question is about how to properly formulate black hole thermodynamics and derive the first law in Horndeski scalar-tensor theories. 

Specifically, the paper points out that the standard Wald entropy formula may not be directly applicable to Horndeski theories due to the presence of derivative interactions and non-minimal couplings between the scalar field and curvature. To address this, the authors follow the original approach by Iyer and Wald to construct black hole thermodynamics from first principles in these theories.

The key steps appear to be:

- Using the Noether charge potential associated with diffeomorphism invariance, which is well-defined in Horndeski theories. 

- Computing the variation of this Noether charge potential on the boundaries (horizon and infinity) to obtain the variation of the Hamiltonian.

- Identifying the variations of the Hamiltonian at infinity and the horizon with the variations of the total mass and black hole entropy, respectively.

- Deriving the first law of black hole thermodynamics from the conservation of the Hamiltonian.

The main hypothesis seems to be that this Iyer-Wald approach will give consistent black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories, even when the standard Wald entropy formula may not directly apply. The paper aims to explicitly demonstrate this formulation and apply it to various black hole solutions as a test.

In summary, the central research question is how to formulate black hole thermodynamics and the first law in Horndeski theories using the Iyer-Wald approach with the Noether charge potential. The main hypothesis is that this will successfully reproduce the expected black hole thermodynamics in these theories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It applies the original Iyer-Wald formulation to derive black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories. Since Horndeski theories contain higher-derivative interactions and nonminimal derivative couplings, the standard Wald entropy formula may not be directly applicable. By using the Noether charge associated with diffeomorphism invariance, the authors are able to derive expressions for the black hole entropy and first law of thermodynamics. 

2. The formulation is applied to various static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in different subclasses of Horndeski theories, both with static and linearly time-dependent scalar fields. For solutions with static scalar fields, the black hole entropy is shown to follow the area law in several cases, even with a nontrivial scalar field profile. 

3. For solutions with a linearly time-dependent scalar field (e.g. stealth Schwarzschild), the black hole entropy depends on the scalar field profile and does not follow the area law. The thermodynamic stability of these solutions is analyzed in certain shift-symmetric Horndeski theories.

4. In the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, the standard Wald entropy formula is recovered using this Iyer-Wald approach, despite the different description of the action. This supports the general applicability of the formulation.

5. The results provide a robust derivation of black hole thermodynamics in broad classes of Horndeski theories, applicable to both static and time-dependent solutions. The stability analysis offers new insights into the phase structure and evolution of certain black hole solutions.

In summary, the key contribution is the derivation of black hole thermodynamics directly from the Iyer-Wald formulation, providing a general and consistent method in Horndeski theories, and applying it to elucidate the thermodynamic properties of various black hole solutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories:

- This paper follows the original formulation of Iyer and Wald to derive black hole thermodynamics, rather than using the standard Wald entropy formula. The authors argue the Wald formula may not apply directly due to the derivative interactions and nonminimal couplings in Horndeski theories.

- The analysis covers both static black holes with a static scalar field profile, and black holes with a linearly time-dependent scalar field profile in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. Many previous works focused only on static solutions.

- For static black holes, the results recover known formulas for Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-(A)dS, and scalarized black holes in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The entropy obeys the area law even with a nontrivial scalar profile. 

- For time-dependent scalar fields, the entropy depends on the scalar field profile and does not follow the area law. This includes novel results for "stealth" Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-(A)dS solutions.

- The paper discusses thermodynamic stability between different black hole solutions, e.g. showing some regimes where stealth Schwarzschild-AdS is favored over GR Schwarzschild-AdS. This provides a stability analysis where linear perturbations fail.

- Overall, the unified approach provides a systematic derivation of black hole thermodynamics across different sectors of Horndeski theories. The results generalize previous works and provide novel insights on stability.

In summary, this paper adapts prior techniques to make broad progress on an open problem, deriving black hole thermodynamics for a very wide class of theories and solutions. The results advance foundational theoretical understanding of these popular modified gravity models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions in the paper's conclusion:

- Extend their analysis to stationary and axisymmetric black holes in Horndeski theories. Their current analysis focused on static and spherically symmetric black holes. Analyzing rotating black holes could reveal new insights.

- Study non-trivial black holes in beyond Horndeski theories. The beyond Horndeski theories extend the Horndeski theories in certain ways while still avoiding Ostrogradsky ghosts. Exploring black holes in these extended theories could be interesting. 

- Further study the thermodynamic stability of black holes with linearly time-dependent scalar fields. The authors discussed stability for some specific cases, but a more comprehensive analysis could be worthwhile. 

- Investigate how allowing different propagation speeds for gravitational waves versus light affects black hole thermodynamics in these theories. The authors assumed the speeds were equal, but relaxing this may matter.

- Apply their generalized Iyer-Wald formalism to other theories beyond Horndeski, such as DHOST theories. This could demonstrate the broader applicability of their formalism.

In summary, the main suggestions are to extend the analysis to more general black hole solutions and other related theories beyond Horndeski, as well as further explore the thermodynamic implications in certain cases. The generalized Iyer-Wald formalism developed here provides a foundation for much future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories, which are scalar-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion that allow for higher-derivative interactions and non-minimal derivative couplings between the scalar field and curvature. Since the standard Wald entropy formula may not apply directly due to these derivative couplings, the authors follow the Iyer-Wald formulation to derive expressions for the black hole entropy and total mass from the variational Hamiltonian, leading to the first law of black hole thermodynamics. They apply the results to various black hole solutions with static and time-dependent scalar hair in shift-symmetric and non-shift symmetric Horndeski theories. Key findings include recovery of the Wald entropy in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, entropy obeying the area law for static black holes with scalar hair, and deviations from the area law for time-dependent stealth black holes, with implications for thermodynamic stability. Overall, the work provides a general framework to study black hole thermodynamics and hairy solutions in Horndeski theories beyond the standard Wald approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Unfortunately I cannot provide a meaningful TL;DR summary of this paper in just one sentence, as it contains technical details about black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories. However, in a few sentences, I could summarize that this paper applies the Iyer-Wald formulation to derive the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the black hole entropy in Horndeski theories. It considers static, spherically symmetric black holes with both static and linearly time-dependent scalar fields. For several black hole solutions, it computes the temperature, mass, and entropy, showing that the entropy does not always follow the usual area law when the scalar field has a nontrivial profile. The results are applied to discuss thermodynamic stability of some black hole solutions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the thermodynamics of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Horndeski theories, which are scalar-tensor theories with higher derivative terms. The authors follow the original formulation by Iyer and Wald to obtain the entropy and mass variations that lead to the first law of black hole thermodynamics. This allows them to apply the formulation to the whole class of Horndeski theories, including those with derivative couplings between the scalar field and curvature. 

The authors first apply the method to black holes with a static scalar field profile. They recover the standard results in general relativity, scalar-tensor theory, and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory. They also find the entropy follows the area law for example solutions in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. Next, they apply the method to solutions with a linearly time-dependent scalar field in shift-symmetric Horndeski theory. Here the entropy depends on the scalar field profile. They use the entropy formula to argue the stealth Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild de-Sitter solutions are thermodynamically unstable compared to their general relativity counterparts in certain ranges of parameters.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a first-principles derivation of black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories using the Iyer-Wald formalism. The key points are:

- Horndeski theories have higher-derivative interactions and nonminimal couplings between the scalar field and curvature, so the standard Wald entropy formula may not apply directly. 

- Following Iyer and Wald, the authors use the Noether charge associated with diffeomorphism invariance to derive the first law and entropy. The variation of the Noether charge on the boundaries gives the change in the Hamiltonian, leading to the first law.

- This is applied to static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions, both with a static scalar profile and a linearly time-dependent profile (in shift-symmetric theories). 

- For solutions with a static scalar, they recover the Wald entropy in specific cases like Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. With a time-dependent scalar, the entropy depends on the scalar field profile.

- They compute the entropy and thermodynamic stability for stealth black holes, finding the stability depends on the sign of derivative couplings.

So in summary, the key method is using the fundamental Noether charge approach to systematically derive black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories, without assuming the validity of the Wald entropy formula. This provides a first-principles basis for studying black hole entropy in these theories.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the topic of black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories. Some key points:

- Horndeski theories are scalar-tensor theories that allow higher derivative interactions of a scalar field as well as non-minimal derivative couplings to curvature, while still having second order equations of motion. 

- The standard Wald entropy formula may not apply directly in Horndeski theories due to the derivative interactions. So the authors follow the original Iyer-Wald formulation to derive black hole thermodynamics.

- They consider static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions, first with a static scalar field profile. Then they look at solutions with a linearly time-dependent scalar in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories.

- For solutions with a static scalar, they recover the Wald entropy formula results for several known cases like Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The entropy follows the area law.

- For solutions with a linearly time-dependent scalar, the entropy depends on the scalar field profile and does not follow the area law in general.

- They apply the results to examples like the stealth Schwarzschild solution and Schwarzschild-(A)dS solutions. Thermodynamic stability depends on the coupling functions.

In summary, the key goal is to formulate black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories using the Iyer-Wald approach, applicable to both static scalar profiles and time-dependent ones, and explore consequences for stability.
