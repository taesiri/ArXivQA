# [Black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question is about how to properly formulate black hole thermodynamics and derive the first law in Horndeski scalar-tensor theories. Specifically, the paper points out that the standard Wald entropy formula may not be directly applicable to Horndeski theories due to the presence of derivative interactions and non-minimal couplings between the scalar field and curvature. To address this, the authors follow the original approach by Iyer and Wald to construct black hole thermodynamics from first principles in these theories.The key steps appear to be:- Using the Noether charge potential associated with diffeomorphism invariance, which is well-defined in Horndeski theories. - Computing the variation of this Noether charge potential on the boundaries (horizon and infinity) to obtain the variation of the Hamiltonian.- Identifying the variations of the Hamiltonian at infinity and the horizon with the variations of the total mass and black hole entropy, respectively.- Deriving the first law of black hole thermodynamics from the conservation of the Hamiltonian.The main hypothesis seems to be that this Iyer-Wald approach will give consistent black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories, even when the standard Wald entropy formula may not directly apply. The paper aims to explicitly demonstrate this formulation and apply it to various black hole solutions as a test.In summary, the central research question is how to formulate black hole thermodynamics and the first law in Horndeski theories using the Iyer-Wald approach with the Noether charge potential. The main hypothesis is that this will successfully reproduce the expected black hole thermodynamics in these theories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It applies the original Iyer-Wald formulation to derive black hole thermodynamics in Horndeski theories. Since Horndeski theories contain higher-derivative interactions and nonminimal derivative couplings, the standard Wald entropy formula may not be directly applicable. By using the Noether charge associated with diffeomorphism invariance, the authors are able to derive expressions for the black hole entropy and first law of thermodynamics. 2. The formulation is applied to various static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in different subclasses of Horndeski theories, both with static and linearly time-dependent scalar fields. For solutions with static scalar fields, the black hole entropy is shown to follow the area law in several cases, even with a nontrivial scalar field profile. 3. For solutions with a linearly time-dependent scalar field (e.g. stealth Schwarzschild), the black hole entropy depends on the scalar field profile and does not follow the area law. The thermodynamic stability of these solutions is analyzed in certain shift-symmetric Horndeski theories.4. In the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, the standard Wald entropy formula is recovered using this Iyer-Wald approach, despite the different description of the action. This supports the general applicability of the formulation.5. The results provide a robust derivation of black hole thermodynamics in broad classes of Horndeski theories, applicable to both static and time-dependent solutions. The stability analysis offers new insights into the phase structure and evolution of certain black hole solutions.In summary, the key contribution is the derivation of black hole thermodynamics directly from the Iyer-Wald formulation, providing a general and consistent method in Horndeski theories, and applying it to elucidate the thermodynamic properties of various black hole solutions.
