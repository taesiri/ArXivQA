# [Delving into the Trajectory Long-tail Distribution for Muti-object   Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper identifies a pronounced long-tail distribution issue in existing multi-object tracking (MOT) datasets, where there is a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians. 
- This skewed distribution causes networks to over-focus on learning features of the more prevalent head classes (pedestrians with longer trajectories), while insufficiently learning features of the less represented tail classes (pedestrians with shorter trajectories).
- This negatively impacts the networks' ability to obtain good pedestrian appearance features and trajectory association performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces tailored strategies to mitigate the effects of the long-tail trajectory distribution, focusing on two key aspects - information augmentation and module improvement.

Information Augmentation:
- Proposes two data augmentation techniques customized for camera viewpoint states:
  - Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA): Simulates pedestrian trajectories of tail classes using backtracking and prediction continuation.
  - Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA): Alters background scenes using image diffusion while retaining pedestrians.

Module Improvement:  
- Devises a Group Softmax (GS) module that divides pedestrians into groups by trajectory length and computes softmax separately per group. This prevents weights of prevalent head classes from suppressing tail classes.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneers investigation into distribution patterns of tracking data and identifies long-tail trajectory distribution issue.
- Introduces first tailored solution focusing on data augmentation and module enhancement to address this distribution imbalance. 
- Achieves SOTA performance improvements when applying proposed strategies to existing MOT methods like FairMOT and CSTrack.
- Opens new research direction on accounting for data distributions in MOT algorithm designs.
