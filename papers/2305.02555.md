# [Should ChatGPT and Bard Share Revenue with Their Data Providers? A New   Business Model for the AI Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02555)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the main research question this paper seeks to address is:

Should AI tools such as ChatGPT share revenue with the providers of the data used to train the models, and if so, how can a fair and transparent scoring system be developed to determine revenue sharing? 

The key points are:

- Large AI models like ChatGPT rely heavily on massive amounts of training data to function well. This data comes from various sources, some copyrighted and some public domain. 

- As these AI tools become commercialized and profitable, there are questions around whether they should share revenue with data providers, even for public domain data, to acknowledge their contribution.

- Current revenue sharing models used in other domains don't directly apply to AI tools. New metrics like prompts and cost per prompt need to be considered instead of clicks and views. 

- The paper proposes developing a scoring system to quantify the engagement and contribution of different data providers to the AI tool based on each prompt. This can be used to determine fair revenue sharing.

- Methods like classification models and text/image similarity calculators are discussed to develop prompt-based scoring systems for data providers.

So in summary, the main research focus is on how to develop new revenue sharing models specifically tailored for AI tools that take into account metrics like prompts and data provider contributions. The scoring system aims to enable transparent and fair revenue sharing with data providers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new revenue sharing business model between AI tools and their data providers. The key points are:

- AI tools like ChatGPT rely heavily on training data to improve their performance. To keep advancing AI technology, they need access to more diverse, high-quality data. 

- However, copyright laws and data privacy concerns limit AI tools' access to certain kinds of data. This creates a hostile, zero-sum relationship between AI tools and data owners.

- The paper argues that AI tools should share revenue with data providers, even for public domain data. This would incentivize more data sharing and create a collaborative, win-win ecosystem.

- Current revenue sharing models like Getty Images' royalty system or Google AdSense's cost-per-action model don't work well for AI tools. New metrics like prompts and cost-per-prompt are needed.

- The paper proposes building scoring systems to quantify each data provider's contribution to the AI tool's performance. This involves training classifiers on the tool's dataset or calculating similarity between providers' data and users' queries. 

- Scores can then be used to share revenue proportionally and transparently with data providers. This model encourages participation without requiring providers to directly share potentially sensitive data.

- The technical feasibility of building scoring systems is demonstrated using text classification and similarity calculations on benchmark datasets. Extensions to image data and multimodal systems are also discussed.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a mutually beneficial revenue sharing framework between AI systems and data providers to promote data sharing and collaborative growth of AI technology. The technical novelty is in strategies to quantify data value like scoring systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a new revenue-sharing business model for AI tools like ChatGPT to compensate data providers and build a collaborative AI ecosystem, by developing scoring systems to quantify data usage based on techniques like text classification and similarity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of revenue sharing models for AI systems:

- The main focus of this paper is on proposing a new revenue sharing model between AI systems and their data providers. This is a relatively novel idea that has not been extensively explored in prior literature. Most existing research on revenue sharing for AI has focused on how to distribute profits between an AI company and its investors/shareholders. 

- The paper argues that a revenue sharing model would encourage more data sharing and create a collaborative ecosystem between AI systems and data providers. This aligns with some emerging discussions around data rights and compensating individuals for their data contributions. However, detailed proposals for AI-data provider revenue shares are still uncommon.

- Methodologically, the paper leverages concepts like text classification, embedding techniques, and similarity scoring that are widely used in NLP research. However, it applies these methods in a new way to quantify data provider contributions. The scoring system approach appears to be a novel contribution not seen in other literature.

- When demonstrating the proposed techniques, the paper relies on standard datasets like Newsgroup20 and Reuters-21578. Using larger real-world datasets, as noted in the conclusions, would make the validation more robust and applicable to commercial AI systems. 

- Discussing multimodal models and healthcare AI applications shows the generalizability of the proposed revenue sharing framework to other AI domains. This is a differentiated aspect not addressed in most data monetization papers focused solely on text/images.

Overall, while revenue sharing between AI systems and data providers has been proposed conceptually before, this paper makes an early attempt at a concrete technical framework to enable it. The prompt-based scoring system is a novel technique and contribution. Future work to implement and validate this system on large-scale datasets from real AI tools would help strengthen the paper's proposals.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Using larger datasets comparable to the training datasets of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to do more realistic modeling and demonstration of building a revenue sharing scoring system. Specifically, they suggest using the Pile dataset (800GB of diverse text) for text and the LAION-5B dataset for images.

- Using explainable AI techniques like SHAP to better explain the supervised classification models to laypeople and make the scoring systems more transparent and interpretable. 

- Enhancing the approach for computing image similarity for LAION-5B by creating a scoring system and assigning scores to each data provider through simulated prompts. 

- Applying the techniques directly on real-world AI tools and their training datasets to demonstrate feasibility and enable the revenue sharing models to be used in practice.

- Exploring the application of similar revenue sharing models to other domains like healthcare AI, though this requires careful consideration. 

- Developing multimodal scoring systems for future multimodal AI tools that can score data providers for each modality (text, image, etc.) separately and then combine the scores.

- Considering legal and regulatory perspectives on compelling AI companies to share revenue, and incentivizing people/organizations to share data, since the technical feasibility is just one aspect. 

In summary, the authors propose enhancements to their current techniques using larger datasets, integrating explainability, testing on real systems, and expanding to other modalities and domains as important next steps to further demonstrate and refine their proposed revenue sharing framework. Legal and regulatory implications are also highlighted for enabling adoption in practice.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper discusses the potential for large AI tools like ChatGPT to generate significant profits in the future. It argues that these tools should share their revenue with the providers of the data used to train them. 

The paper explains that AI tools like ChatGPT need large amounts of high quality training data to improve their performance. However, copyright laws and data privacy concerns limit their access to diverse data sources. Sharing revenue with data providers could transform the hostile, zero-sum relationship between AI tools and copyrighted data into a collaborative, win-win partnership. This would motivate more data owners to participate and provide access to their data. The paper then proposes methods to build scoring systems that can evaluate each data provider's contribution to the AI tool. These scores would determine how much revenue is shared with each provider. The scoring systems are based on either classification models or text/image similarity calculators applied to the training data and user prompts/responses. Overall, the paper makes a case for revenue sharing as a way to build an AI ecosystem that benefits tools, users, and data providers alike.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes establishing a new revenue-sharing business model between AI tools and their data providers. It argues that AI tools should share revenue with the providers of the data used to train the models, in order to incentivize data sharing and create a mutually beneficial AI ecosystem. The main method discussed is building a prompt-based scoring system to quantify the engagement and contribution of each data provider. Two approaches are presented for building the scoring system: 1) training a text classifier on the AI tool's dataset to assign probability scores reflecting engagement, and 2) calculating similarity between the data providers' content and user prompts/model outputs to derive similarity scores for providers. These scores can then be used to proportionally allocate revenue sharing. The scoring system aims to be simple, transparent, and independent from the AI tool's model. Demonstrations using text classification and similarity on benchmark datasets are provided. Overall, the paper proposes a technical framework and methodology for enabling fair revenue sharing between AI systems and data providers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether AI tools like ChatGPT should share revenue with the providers of the data used to train their models. The key points made in the paper are:

- Deep learning models like ChatGPT rely heavily on large amounts of training data to improve their performance. However, due to data privacy and copyright laws, most AI tools can only use publicly available data. 

- To keep improving, AI tools need access to more diverse, higher quality, and up-to-date data. But getting access to additional copyrighted data sources is challenging under current copyright laws.

- This has resulted in a hostile, zero-sum relationship between AI tools and data providers - data providers lose traffic/revenue to AI tools, while AI tools have limited data. 

- The paper proposes that AI tools should share revenue with data providers, compensating them for the value of their data. This would incentivize more data sharing and create a collaborative, win-win relationship.

- However, current revenue sharing models like Getty Images' royalty-based system or Google AdSense's cost-per-action model don't work for AI tools. New metrics like prompts and cost-per-prompt are needed.

- The paper proposes establishing a prompt-based scoring system to measure each data provider's "data engagement" and distribute revenue proportionally and transparently based on this.

So in summary, the key question is whether AI tools should share revenue with data providers, and if so, how to design a fair, transparent scoring system to enable this revenue sharing model. The paper aims to show why this is important for the AI ecosystem and proposes techniques to implement it.
