# [Manifold Diffusion Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15586)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop a generative model to learn distributions over continuous functions defined on Riemannian manifolds?The key points are:- The paper introduces Manifold Diffusion Fields (MDF), a generative model to learn distributions over functions whose domain is a Riemannian manifold rather than Euclidean space. - This is challenging because manifolds lack a canonical coordinate system, and functions are infinite dimensional. - The paper uses eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator to define an intrinsic coordinate system on the manifold. - MDF represents functions using multiple input-output pairs and can generate new continuous functions on the manifold.- Experiments show MDF can capture distributions over functions on various manifolds better than previous approaches, with improved diversity and fidelity.So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a generative model that can learn distributions over continuous functions defined on general Riemannian manifolds, which Manifold Diffusion Fields aims to address.
