# [How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How expressive/attentive are Graph Attention Networks (GATs) compared to other graph neural network architectures?

Specifically, the paper investigates whether GATs actually compute the kind of "dynamic" attention they are conceptually intended to, or if their attention mechanism is more limited or "static". The main hypothesis seems to be that the standard implementation of GAT uses a restricted form of attention that limits its expressiveness on certain graph problems compared to a modified version proposed in the paper.

To summarize, the key questions/hypotheses addressed are:

- Do GATs compute dynamic or static attention? 

- Is the standard GAT attention mechanism sufficiently expressive for complex graph problems?

- Can a modified GAT architecture with more dynamic attention perform better on challenging graph tasks?

The paper aims to theoretically and empirically analyze the differences between static and dynamic graph attention, demonstrate limitations of standard GATs, and show improved performance from the proposed more dynamic graph attention network.
