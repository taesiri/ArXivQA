# [DUCK: Distance-based Unlearning via Centroid Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02052)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces DUCK, a novel machine unlearning algorithm that leverages metric learning to selectively erase information about a subset of training data (termed the "forget set") from a trained neural network model. The key idea is to compute class centroids in the embedding space and minimize the distance between forget set samples and their closest incorrect class centroid, effectively corrupting the information content. DUCK is evaluated across image classification datasets on two scenarios: class removal, where an entire class constitutes the forget set, and homogeneous sampling removal, where the forget set comprises random training samples. The proposed Adaptive Unlearning Score (AUS) metric effectively captures the trade-off between retaining performance on non-forget data versus forgetting capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate DUCK's state-of-the-art performance on both scenarios. A novel membership inference attack is also introduced to verify actual erasure of forget set data. The algorithm is fast, simple, model-agnostic and can handle multiple class removal. The results confirm DUCK as an effective, practical and verifiable machine unlearning technique for induce targeted forgetting in neural networks while preserving generalization performance.
