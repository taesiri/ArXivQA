# [Align and Prompt: Video-and-Language Pre-training with Entity Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn effective cross-modal video-language representations from sparse video frames and text. The key hypotheses are:

1. Learning instance-level video-text alignment with a contrastive loss can help align the features from individual modalities and ease subsequent cross-modal modeling. 

2. Learning fine-grained region-entity alignment between visual regions and textual entities, via the proposed prompting entity modeling task, can improve the model's capability in capturing and reasoning about local visual information.

3. Operating on sparsely sampled frames rather than dense feature extraction can enable end-to-end learning while being efficient.

To summarize, the paper proposes a new cross-modal pre-training framework, called Align and Prompt (ALPRO), with two novel techniques - video-text contrastive loss and prompting entity modeling - to learn better aligned video-language representations from sparse inputs. It hypothesizes these techniques can improve performance on downstream video-text tasks compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Align and Prompt (ALPRO), a new video-language pre-training framework that operates on sparsely-sampled video frames. 

2. It introduces a video-text contrastive loss to better align instance-level unimodal video and text representations, thus easing the modeling of cross-modal interactions.

3. It proposes a novel visually-grounded pre-training task called prompting entity modeling, which enables the model to capture fine-grained region-entity alignment without needing object detectors.

4. It demonstrates the effectiveness of ALPRO on both video-text retrieval and video question answering tasks, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, it achieves 3.0% and 5.4% absolute improvement in recall on text-video retrieval on the MSRVTT dataset.

In summary, the key innovation is using a prompt-based method to generate soft entity pseudo-labels from web videos and text, which provides supervision to align visual regions and text entities. This allows learning fine-grained visual reasoning without expensive object detectors. Experiments show superior performance on retrieval and QA compared to prior arts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new video-language pre-training method called Align and Prompt (ALPRO) that learns to align unimodal video and text features using contrastive learning, and generates soft entity labels via prompting to enable fine-grained region-entity alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on text-video retrieval and video question answering tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons of this paper to other research in video-language pre-training:

- Most prior works use densely extracted video features, while this paper follows the recent trend of using sparsely sampled raw frames. This allows for end-to-end finetuning of the visual backbone. 

- Many previous methods rely solely on cross-modal transformers or dot-product to model video-text interactions. This paper argues these approaches fail to address the misalignment between the modalities. They propose a video-text contrastive loss to better align the features.

- For visually-grounded pre-training, methods typically use masked language modeling or object detectors. This paper argues detectors have limited vocabularies and introduces a novel prompting-based approach to generate soft pseudo-labels for a broader range of visual entities.

- This method achieves state-of-the-art results on text-video retrieval and video QA using an order of magnitude fewer video-text pairs for pre-training compared to prior arts.

- The technical contributions focus on aligning video-text features for retrieval and capturing fine-grained entity information for video QA. The improvements on both tasks demonstrate the versatility of the approach.

- Compared to concurrent work like ClipBERT and FiT, this method better models temporal information by pre-training on video rather than static image pairs. The prompting approach is also novel.

In summary, this paper makes several notable contributions in bridging the misalignment between modalities and learning from web data without human annotations. The results validate the effectiveness of their technical improvements for video-language representation learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Better prompt engineering/prompt tuning to improve the quality of the entity pseudo-labels generated by the prompter module. The authors mention this could involve exploring more diverse prompt templates.

- Prompt-guided region selection for the prompting entity modeling task. Currently regions are selected randomly, but the authors suggest prompting could potentially help select more informative regions by incorporating temporal information. 

- Extending the approach beyond video to image-text representation learning or even image representation learning alone. The prompting framework is generic and could be applied in these other domains.

- Additional model analysis before deployment to examine issues like harmfulness of web-scraped training data. The authors mention this as an important broader impact to consider.

- Scaling up in terms of model size and compute to further improve performance. The authors demonstrate strong results with a base BERT model, but larger models could likely achieve even better performance.

So in summary, the main future directions are around improvements to the prompting approach itself, applying it to new domains beyond video, further model analysis, and scaling up the model size and computation. The core prompting framework seems very flexible and extendable to enable a lot of future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Align and Prompt (ALPRO), a new video-language pre-training framework that learns effective cross-modal representations from sparsely sampled video frames and text. ALPRO introduces two main techniques - a video-text contrastive loss to align unimodal features at the instance level, and a novel visually-grounded pre-training task called prompting entity modeling to enable fine-grained alignment between visual regions and textual entities. An entity prompter module is designed to generate soft pseudo-labels to supervise the prompting entity modeling task in a self-supervised manner. ALPRO is pre-trained on large webly sourced video-text pairs and achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks of text-video retrieval and video question answering. It significantly outperforms previous methods while using orders of magnitude less pre-training data. The technical innovations allow ALPRO to learn better aligned cross-modal representations from sparse video inputs without reliance on object detectors.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Align and Prompt (ALPro), a new video-language pre-training framework that operates on sparsely sampled video frames and text. ALPro introduces two key techniques to learn more effective cross-modal video-text representations. First, it uses a video-text contrastive loss to align features at the instance level, encouraging paired videos and texts to have similar representations. Second, it proposes a novel pre-training task called prompting entity modeling, which generates pseudo-labels of entities in video crops using a pretrained text-video matcher. This provides additional supervision to align visual regions with textual entities. 

ALPro is pretrained on a dataset of 5.5 million web video-text pairs, much less than other recent methods. It achieves state-of-the-art results on text-video retrieval and video question answering benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin. For example, on text-video retrieval on MSRVTT, ALPro achieves a 5.4% absolute improvement in R@10 score compared to prior work. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for aligning video and language representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Align and Prompt (ALPRO), a new video-language pre-training framework that learns to align videos and text without relying on object detectors. ALPRO has two main components - a video-language pre-training model and a prompter module. The pre-training model encodes sparse video frames and text using transformer encoders and captures their interaction through a multimodal encoder. ALPRO introduces two novel pre-training objectives - a video-text contrastive loss to align instance-level video and text features, and prompting entity modeling which uses the prompter to generate pseudo-labels of entities in random video crops for self-supervision. The prompter is first trained to match videos and text using contrastive learning, and then used to produce soft entity labels for video crops by computing similarities between the crop and textual entity prompts. Pre-training with these losses enables ALPRO to learn fine-grained region-entity alignment from web videos and text without extra annotations. Experiments show ALPRO significantly outperforms prior work on retrieval and videoQA tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing several limitations in current video-and-language pre-training models:

1. The interaction between video and text features is commonly modeled in a simple way using dot-product or cross-modal transformers. But features from the individual modalities reside in different embedding spaces, making direct cross-modal interaction less effective. 

2. Many visually-grounded pre-training tasks do not explicitly model fine-grained regional visual information like objects. This is important for downstream tasks like videoQA that require visual reasoning. Using object detectors for supervision is inefficient and restricted to a small vocabulary.

3. Previous sparse pre-training models like ClipBERT use an image encoder, which is less effective at modeling temporal video information.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a new video-language pre-training framework called Align and Prompt (ALPro) that operates on sparsely sampled video frames. The key ideas are:

1. A video-text contrastive loss aligns instance-level video and text features before fusion.

2. A novel pre-training task called prompting entity modeling predicts entities in video crops using soft pseudo-labels from a learned prompter module. This captures fine-grained region-entity alignment without extra annotations.

The methods aim to learn more effective cross-modal video-language representations from sparse video inputs. Experiments show significant gains over previous approaches on retrieval and videoQA tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some of the key terms and concepts are:

AlPro introduces two key techniques: 1) a video-text contrastive (VTC) loss that aligns unimodal video and text features at the instance level, easing subsequent modeling of cross-modal interactions; and 2) prompting entity modeling (PEM), a novel pre-training task where the model predicts entities in random video crops based on joint video-text inputs.
