# [Dynamic Quality-Diversity Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Dynamic Quality-Diversity Search":

Problem:
Most quality-diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites and CMA-ME are designed to tackle static optimization problems. However, many real-world problems are dynamic, where the environment changes over time in ways that impact the fitness landscape and behavior characteristics (BCs) of solutions. This paper tackles the challenge of adapting QD algorithms to keep track of good solutions even when such unexpected dynamic changes occur.

Solution:
The paper proposes a Dynamic QD (D-QD) framework to address this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Detecting environment shifts: Re-evaluate some solutions to detect if their objective score or BCs changed compared to previously recorded values. This is done either on the oldest unevaluated solutions or the solutions that offspring would replace. 

2) Offspring generation: Modify how parents are selected or offspring generated to focus search on areas of the space with potentially outdated solutions. This is implemented via biased parent selection in D-MAP-Elites and modifying the mean vector in D-CMA-ME.

3) Archive re-evaluation: When a shift is detected, re-evaluate some solutions in the archive to update it. In this work, they re-evaluate the solutions that new offspring would replace.

The framework is tested on dynamic variants of the sphere benchmark problem and lunar lander environment.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a general Dynamic QD methodology extending QD algorithms to dynamic optimization.

- Introduces two strategies for detecting environment shifts based on re-evaluating oldest solutions or candidate replacees.

- Suggests modifications to MAP-Elites and CMA-ME's search to focus on areas of the space with potentially outdated solutions.

- Demonstrates the ability of Dynamic QD variants to keep more solutions updated compared to doing no re-evaluations, while requiring fewer evaluations than re-evaluating the full archive.

- Provides a detailed experimental analysis quantifying performance trade-offs between accuracy of tracking change, computational cost, and proportion of updated solutions.
