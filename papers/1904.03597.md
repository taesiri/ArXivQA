# [Self-supervised Spatio-temporal Representation Learning for Videos by   Predicting Motion and Appearance Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03597)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we learn powerful spatio-temporal video representations in a self-supervised manner, without requiring manually annotated labels?

The key hypothesis is that by training a spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict motion and appearance statistics derived from unlabeled video data, it will learn useful spatio-temporal features that transfer well to other video analysis tasks.

In particular, the paper proposes predicting statistics like:
- The region with the largest motion and its direction
- The most color consistent region over time and its dominant color 
- The most color diverse region over time and its dominant color

By regressing these motion and appearance statistics in a self-supervised manner on unlabeled video, the paper hypothesizes that the model will learn good video representations without needing any manual annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal video representations by predicting motion and appearance statistics. Specifically:

- They design a self-supervised task of predicting a set of statistical labels derived from motion boundaries and color distributions in videos, without using any human annotations. 

- The statistical labels encode motion information like the region with largest motion and its direction, as well as appearance information like the most diverse color region.

- They show this self-supervised task can be used to pre-train a 3D ConvNet (C3D) to learn effective spatio-temporal features for video analysis.

- Extensive experiments show their method outperforms previous self-supervised methods on action recognition and other video analysis tasks when using the pre-trained C3D features.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a self-supervised approach for spatio-temporal video representation learning by predicting motion and appearance statistics, which achieves superior performance to prior self-supervised methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal video representations by training a 3D CNN to predict motion and appearance statistics derived from unlabeled videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance on action recognition compared to other self-supervised methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in self-supervised video representation learning:

- The paper focuses on learning spatio-temporal features from unlabeled video, as opposed to just spatial features from single frames. Many other self-supervised approaches have focused only on images rather than video. Learning spatio-temporal features is important for many video analysis tasks.

- The method uses motion and appearance statistics derived from the input videos as supervision signals. This is a novel approach compared to other self-supervised tasks like solving puzzles or predicting rotations. The statistics are designed to capture useful information about the motion and appearance in videos.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance compared to prior self-supervised methods on standard action recognition benchmarks like UCF101 and HMDB51 using a C3D network. The learned features also transfer well to other tasks like action similarity labeling and dynamic scene recognition.

- The approach is inspired by biological vision and tries to mimic how humans inherently understand motion and appearance statistics by observation. This motivation is unique compared to other self-supervised approaches.

- The method does not rely on any external data like optical flow or object tracking. The supervisory signals come only from the input videos themselves.

Overall, this paper presents a novel self-supervised task tailored for spatio-temporal representation learning on videos. The results demonstrate that learning to predict motion and appearance statistics is an effective pretext task compared to prior work. The features learned transfer well across different video analysis benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions in the Conclusions section:

- Investigating other statistical concepts beyond motion and appearance statistics that can provide useful self-supervision for spatio-temporal representation learning. 

- Exploring different network architectures beyond C3D that can benefit from the proposed self-supervised approach.

- Applying the learned representations to other video understanding tasks beyond the ones explored in the paper, such as video captioning, action localization, etc. 

- Developing curriculum learning strategies to select more informative statistics to predict during different stages of self-supervised pre-training.

- Combining the proposed self-supervised method with other regularization techniques like channel replication, spatio-temporal jittering, etc. to further improve the learned representations.

So in summary, they suggest exploring variations of the statistical concepts, network architectures, target tasks, curriculum strategies, and spatial patterns to further advance self-supervised video representation learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel self-supervised approach for learning spatio-temporal video representations without human-annotated labels. The key idea is to train a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) like C3D to predict motion and appearance statistics derived from input videos in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, the approach involves computing optical flow to obtain motion boundaries and color diversity for each spatio-temporal region of the video. The CNN is then trained to predict the region with maximum motion and its direction, the most/least diverse regions in color and their dominant colors, etc. By predicting such spatial and temporal statistics, the CNN is forced to learn useful spatio-temporal features from unlabeled videos. Experiments show the method significantly outperforms training from scratch and other self-supervised techniques on action recognition and transfer learning tasks using standard video datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51. The learned features are shown to be transferable to other video tasks like action similarity labeling and dynamic scene recognition.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel self-supervised approach for learning spatio-temporal video representations using a 3D CNN. The key idea is to predict motion and appearance statistics from unlabeled video, derived by dividing frames into spatial regions and computing properties like dominant motion, direction, color diversity, etc. This provides supervision to train a 3D CNN like C3D to learn useful features without manual annotations. Specifically, the approach computes motion boundaries to capture region-level motion statistics, and color diversity over time to capture appearance statistics. These are encoded as spatial map labels for self-supervision. Experiments show this approach significantly improves C3D's performance on action recognition over training from scratch, achieving state-of-the-art on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. The learned features also transfer well to other tasks like action similarity labeling and scene recognition, demonstrating their generalizability. 

In summary, this paper presents a novel self-supervised approach for spatio-temporal video representation learning using a 3D CNN. By predicting motion and appearance statistics derived from unlabeled video as supervision, it trains C3D to learn powerful features that generalize well to various video analysis tasks. Key aspects include computing motion boundaries and color diversity as statistical labels, along with a multi-task framework using both local and global statistics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training results on standard benchmarks. The main contribution is a simple yet effective approach for representation learning from unlabeled video by predicting natural motion and appearance statistics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal video representations without using human-annotated labels. The key idea is to predict motion and appearance statistics derived from input videos as supervision. Specifically, the method divides each video into spatial regions and computes optical flow-based motion boundaries to identify the region with the largest motion and its dominant direction. It also computes color diversity over time in each region to identify the most diverse and most consistent colors. These motion and appearance statistics are predicted using a C3D convolutional neural network in a self-supervised manner to learn useful spatio-temporal features. By pretrained on unlabeled videos this way, C3D significantly improves action recognition performance on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets compared to training from scratch. The learned features also transfer well to other video tasks like action similarity labeling and dynamic scene recognition. Overall, the self-supervised task of predicting simple motion and appearance statistics is shown to be an effective approach for spatio-temporal representation learning from unlabeled videos.
