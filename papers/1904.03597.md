# [Self-supervised Spatio-temporal Representation Learning for Videos by   Predicting Motion and Appearance Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03597)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn powerful spatio-temporal video representations in a self-supervised manner, without requiring manually annotated labels?The key hypothesis is that by training a spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict motion and appearance statistics derived from unlabeled video data, it will learn useful spatio-temporal features that transfer well to other video analysis tasks.In particular, the paper proposes predicting statistics like:- The region with the largest motion and its direction- The most color consistent region over time and its dominant color - The most color diverse region over time and its dominant colorBy regressing these motion and appearance statistics in a self-supervised manner on unlabeled video, the paper hypothesizes that the model will learn good video representations without needing any manual annotations.
