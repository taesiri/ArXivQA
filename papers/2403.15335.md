# [Safe and Stable Teleoperation of Quadrotor UAVs under Haptic Shared   Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenges of ensuring both safety and stability in the haptic teleoperation of quadrotor UAVs. Specifically, the paper considers a framework of Haptic Shared Autonomy (HSA), where an autonomous controller acts as an intermediary between the human operator and the UAV to guarantee safety. However, the interactions between the human, controller, and UAV through force feedback can lead to unstable behaviors like oscillations. Therefore, the paper aims to develop approaches that can achieve safety through the autonomous controller while also maintaining stability of the closed-loop system.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes two design methodologies - Sequential Control-Force (SCF) and Joint Control-Force (JCF) - to address both safety and stability. For safety, both methods leverage Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to constrain the control input to avoid collisions. For stability, a finite $\cL_2$-gain condition enforced via an energy tank is used to limit the force feedback perceived by the human. The key difference is that SCF designs the control first followed by the force, while JCF optimizes for both jointly. This leads to different responses - SCF tries to match the original command closely unless safety is violated, while JCF introduces more modifications. The feasibility and real-time applicability of the formulations are also discussed.

Main Contributions:
- Two novel formulations, SCF and JCF, that achieve the dual goals of safety and stability under a HSA framework, which has not been done before
- Analysis of the different responses to user commands between SCF and JCF, allowing the choice of design based on preference 
- Flexible approach that can handle different nonlinear system dynamics by computing required Lie derivatives
- Real-time capable solutions through quadratic programming or closed-form solutions
- Validation of proposed methods through simulations and experiments on a real UAV and haptic device

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in ensuring safe and stable haptic teleoperation of UAVs, with rigorous analysis and experimental verification of the proposed techniques.
