# [Bayesian Updates Compose Optically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01631)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether Bayesian inference for a composite generative process can be constructed compositionally, by combining the Bayesian inferences for the component processes. Specifically, the paper investigates whether the Bayesian inversion of a composite stochastic channel is equal (or almost equal) to the composition of the Bayesian inversions of the channel's factors. This is formalized categorically, by showing that channels that admit Bayesian inversions embed into a category of "Bayesian lenses", where the composition of lenses captures this compositional form of Bayesian inversion.The main result is stated in Theorem 3 and Corollary 1, which show that Bayesian updates compose optically, meaning that Bayesian inversion is an instance of a general bidirectional transformation pattern known as a lens. This allows Bayesian inference for complex generative processes to be constructed modularly from inferences about the components.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that Bayesian inversion can be built compositionally by combining component inversions, rather than having to invert the composite process as a whole. The paper aims to prove this mathematically in the language of category theory.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Defining a collection of fibred categories whose morphisms depend on states in the base category (Definition 3.1). This allows formalizing the state-dependence of Bayesian inversion. The framework is shown to be more general, with potential for wider applicability.2. Constructing categories of optics (Proposition 4.2) from these fibred categories, using their (co)Yoneda embeddings to define actegory structures. Corresponding notions of Bayesian lens and mixed Bayesian lens are introduced (Definitions 4.3 and 4.5). 3. Proving that the Bayesian inversion of a composite channel coincides with the lens composite of the inversions of its factors (Theorem 5.1). This shows that Bayesian updates compose optically. As a consequence, channels are shown to embed functorially into Bayesian lenses (Corollary 5.2).4. Showing that "exact" Bayesian lenses are only weakly lawful in the sense of traditional lens laws (Section 6). This is argued to be a desirable property for representing uncertain beliefs.5. Providing accessible and pedagogical proofs of the main theorem, in both abstract and concrete form, to illustrate the common structures. This includes graphical calculus for clarity.Overall, the paper introduces a general framework for state-dependent transformations, shows Bayesian inference is an instance, and proves Bayesian updates have an optical compositionality property. The results and techniques seem potentially useful in categorical cybernetics. The exposition aims to make the abstract concepts approachable.
