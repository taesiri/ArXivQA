# [Towards Expert-Level Medical Question Answering with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09617)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve expert-level performance in medical question answering, as assessed through both standardized tests and expert evaluation of long-form responses?The authors seem to be investigating whether the latest LLMs, specifically Med-PaLM 2 developed in this work, can demonstrate physician-level knowledge and reasoning ability on medical exams and in generating medical advice. The key hypotheses tested are:1) Med-PaLM 2 can exceed previous benchmarks on standardized medical exams like those testing USMLE knowledge. 2) Med-PaLM 2 can generate high-quality long-form responses to consumer medical questions that are comparable or preferable to those written by physicians, when evaluated by physicians and laypeople.3) Med-PaLM 2 will outperform previous models like Med-PaLM on these metrics through improvements to the base LLM, domain-specific training, and prompting strategies.The authors evaluate these hypotheses through both standardized multiple choice tests like MedQA and MedMCQA, as well as several human evaluation studies of long-form responses using rubrics and pairwise comparisons. The central research question is whether LLMs can demonstrate expert-level medical question-answering, which they aim to comprehensively evaluate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The development of Med-PaLM 2, a new large language model for medical question answering. Med-PaLM 2 builds on improvements in the base model architecture (using PaLM 2) as well as medical domain-specific finetuning.2. Introducing a new prompting strategy called ensemble refinement to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models on multiple choice medical questions. 3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art results with Med-PaLM 2 on several medical QA benchmarks, including a 19% improvement over Med-PaLM on MedQA.4. Rigorous human evaluation of Med-PaLM 2 on long-form question answering using physician raters. This revealed strengths of Med-PaLM 2 over prior methods, including preference over physician-generated answers on 8 out of 9 clinically-relevant axes.5. Introduction of two new challenging adversarial test sets to probe model limitations, on which Med-PaLM 2 also showed significant gains.In summary, the main contributions appear to be advancing the state-of-the-art in medical QA through model improvements, rigorous benchmarking and evaluation, and identification of remaining challenges and limitations to guide further research. The results overall suggest rapid progress towards expert-level performance on medical question answering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:This paper presents Med-PaLM 2, a new large language model for medical question answering that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by physicians over Med-PaLM and even other physicians' answers for consumer health questions across several clinically-relevant dimensions.
