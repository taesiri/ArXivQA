# [Towards Expert-Level Medical Question Answering with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09617)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve expert-level performance in medical question answering, as assessed through both standardized tests and expert evaluation of long-form responses?The authors seem to be investigating whether the latest LLMs, specifically Med-PaLM 2 developed in this work, can demonstrate physician-level knowledge and reasoning ability on medical exams and in generating medical advice. The key hypotheses tested are:1) Med-PaLM 2 can exceed previous benchmarks on standardized medical exams like those testing USMLE knowledge. 2) Med-PaLM 2 can generate high-quality long-form responses to consumer medical questions that are comparable or preferable to those written by physicians, when evaluated by physicians and laypeople.3) Med-PaLM 2 will outperform previous models like Med-PaLM on these metrics through improvements to the base LLM, domain-specific training, and prompting strategies.The authors evaluate these hypotheses through both standardized multiple choice tests like MedQA and MedMCQA, as well as several human evaluation studies of long-form responses using rubrics and pairwise comparisons. The central research question is whether LLMs can demonstrate expert-level medical question-answering, which they aim to comprehensively evaluate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The development of Med-PaLM 2, a new large language model for medical question answering. Med-PaLM 2 builds on improvements in the base model architecture (using PaLM 2) as well as medical domain-specific finetuning.2. Introducing a new prompting strategy called ensemble refinement to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models on multiple choice medical questions. 3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art results with Med-PaLM 2 on several medical QA benchmarks, including a 19% improvement over Med-PaLM on MedQA.4. Rigorous human evaluation of Med-PaLM 2 on long-form question answering using physician raters. This revealed strengths of Med-PaLM 2 over prior methods, including preference over physician-generated answers on 8 out of 9 clinically-relevant axes.5. Introduction of two new challenging adversarial test sets to probe model limitations, on which Med-PaLM 2 also showed significant gains.In summary, the main contributions appear to be advancing the state-of-the-art in medical QA through model improvements, rigorous benchmarking and evaluation, and identification of remaining challenges and limitations to guide further research. The results overall suggest rapid progress towards expert-level performance on medical question answering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:This paper presents Med-PaLM 2, a new large language model for medical question answering that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by physicians over Med-PaLM and even other physicians' answers for consumer health questions across several clinically-relevant dimensions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents interesting work on developing large language models for medical question answering. Here are some key ways it compares to other recent research in this field:- It shows major improvements over prior best results on the MedQA benchmark. For instance, Med-PaLM 2 achieves 86.5%, compared to previous best results around 60-67% for models like Flan-PaLM. This demonstrates the rapid progress of LLMs on standardized medical QA benchmarks.- It provides one of the most extensive human evaluations of LLM performance on medical question answering. The pairwise rankings and multiple rating dimensions provide granular insights into model capabilities and limitations. Prior work has mostly focused on multiple choice leaderboards.- The introduction of "adversarial" medical questions to probe model safety and biases is an important contribution. Past work has not really focused on this aspect. The analyses indicate these issues remain a challenge but Med-PaLM 2 shows improvements.- The ensemble refinement prompting strategy introduced here is novel and shows promise. Other recent work has explored related ideas like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency, but the ensemble approach is unique.- The model builds on large generative LLMs like PaLM, without major architecture changes. Other recent work has explored specialized medical encoders. This shows the power of scale and prompting alone.- For clinical applications, further rigor around potential test set overlap, model calibration, and additional human validation is still needed. But this pushes forward model capabilities and evaluation methodology.In summary, this paper demonstrates leading performance on medical QA through scale, prompting strategies, and alignment techniques. The rich human evaluation provides new insights into assessing these models. The focus on safety via adversarial examples is also an important advance. This represents some of the most promising work to date in developing LLMs for medicine.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Further development and validation of rubrics to rigorously assess AI model performance in medical question answering. The authors note limitations of their current evaluation rubric and suggest more work is needed on developing robust frameworks to measure model alignment with physician answers across different contexts.- More research on model performance grounded in specific clinical workflows and scenarios. The current evaluations were not tied to particular use cases which limits generalizability. Studies situated in real-world settings would be valuable.- Expanding the adversarial evaluation to increase coverage of health equity topics and allow disaggregated analysis over different sensitive characteristics. The current adversarial evaluation was limited in scope. - Comparing model answers to multiple physician responses per question to better assess the range of acceptable responses. The current study only compared to a single physician answer per question. - Incorporating evaluation of model capabilities for multi-turn dialogues and active information gathering. The current work focused on one-shot question answering.- Further analyzing model performance across different medical specialties, environments, patient populations and communication needs. The physician raters represented a subset of these variables.- Developing enhanced strategies for improving reasoning, safety and alignment such as through multi-task learning and reinforcement learning over the human evaluation metrics.In summary, the authors highlight the need for continued research to measure model alignment with physicians in more robust, granular and clinically grounded ways as well as using these evaluations to drive further improvements in model safety, reasoning and utility.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: This paper presents Med-PaLM 2, a large language model developed by Google Research for medical question answering. The model builds on improvements in Google's general language model PaLM 2 as well as targeted medical domain finetuning. Med-PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on several medical question answering benchmarks, including MedQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU. A key contribution is the development of an ensemble refinement prompting strategy that improves the model's reasoning capabilities. However, multiple-choice benchmarks alone are insufficient to evaluate real-world clinical utility. Therefore, the authors introduce rigorous human evaluation of long-form answers along clinically relevant axes like consensus alignment and potential for harm. On over 1000 consumer medical questions, Med-PaLM 2 answers were preferred by physicians over Med-PaLM and even physician-generated answers on most metrics. The model also showed significant gains over Med-PaLM on adversarial test sets. While further validation is still needed, these results represent rapid progress towards expert-level medical question answering with large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents Med-PaLM 2, a new large language model for medical question answering. Med-PaLM 2 builds on prior work developing Med-PaLM, the first model to exceed expert-level performance on the MedQA benchmark. Med-PaLM 2 incorporates several improvements, including using the PaLM 2 model as a base, medical domain-specific finetuning, and a new prompting strategy called ensemble refinement. Through ensemble refinement, the model conditions on multiple possible reasoning paths to refine its final answer. On the MedQA benchmark, Med-PaLM 2 achieves 86.5% accuracy, exceeding Med-PaLM by over 19%. The model also reaches near state-of-the-art performance on several other medical QA datasets. Importantly, human evaluation found Med-PaLM 2 answers were preferred over Med-PaLM and physician answers for consumer health questions across multiple clinically relevant dimensions like reasoning, consensus alignment, and avoiding harm. The results highlight rapid progress in aligning large language models to the requirements of the medical domain. Further validation of safety and ethics will be critical as this technology sees real-world uptake.
