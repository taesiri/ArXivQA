# [Towards Expert-Level Medical Question Answering with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09617)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve expert-level performance in medical question answering, as assessed through both standardized tests and expert evaluation of long-form responses?The authors seem to be investigating whether the latest LLMs, specifically Med-PaLM 2 developed in this work, can demonstrate physician-level knowledge and reasoning ability on medical exams and in generating medical advice. The key hypotheses tested are:1) Med-PaLM 2 can exceed previous benchmarks on standardized medical exams like those testing USMLE knowledge. 2) Med-PaLM 2 can generate high-quality long-form responses to consumer medical questions that are comparable or preferable to those written by physicians, when evaluated by physicians and laypeople.3) Med-PaLM 2 will outperform previous models like Med-PaLM on these metrics through improvements to the base LLM, domain-specific training, and prompting strategies.The authors evaluate these hypotheses through both standardized multiple choice tests like MedQA and MedMCQA, as well as several human evaluation studies of long-form responses using rubrics and pairwise comparisons. The central research question is whether LLMs can demonstrate expert-level medical question-answering, which they aim to comprehensively evaluate.
