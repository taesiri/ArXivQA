# [CoEdIT: Text Editing by Task-Specific Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09857)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models for text editing by leveraging diverse task-specific data. Specifically, the authors aim to investigate:1) If fine-tuning a standard instruction-tuned language model on a diverse set of text editing tasks and instructions can improve performance across a wide variety of text editing benchmarks (RQ1).2) If such a model can generalize to perform high-quality edits for new, unseen types of instructions, including compositional instructions with combinations of tasks (RQ2). 3) If the model can make the text revision process more efficient and effective for human writers (RQ3).The main hypothesis seems to be that creating a dense space of focused text editing tasks and instructions will allow instruction-tuned models to better generalize to new text editing tasks and composite instructions, compared to models trained on more sparse, general instructions. The authors suggest current LLMs may be underfitted for specialized tasks like text editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing CoEdIT, a text editing system for writing assistance that uses natural language instructions. The key highlights are:- CoEdIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text editing benchmarks like grammatical error correction, text simplification, iterative text editing, and stylistic editing tasks. - Even the smallest CoEdIT model with densified instruction tuning outperforms larger supervised text editing models, instruction-tuned models, and general purpose LLMs with nearly 60x more parameters. This shows the importance of dense task/instruction space over simply scaling model size.- CoEdIT generalizes well to new, unseen tasks not seen during training as well as composite instructions with multiple task specifications. - CoEdIT is fully open-sourced with code, data, and models publicly available to support open research.- The authors build CoEdIT by fine-tuning a sequence-to-sequence model on a parallel corpus of 82K instruction-based input-output pairs sourced from text editing datasets. The instructions are constructed using lexical and semantic variations.In summary, the main contribution is introducing CoEdIT, an open-sourced text editing system that achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging instruction tuning on diverse text editing tasks and generalizes well to new tasks and composite instructions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper introduces CoEdIT, a text editing system that leverages instruction tuning of large language models on diverse text editing benchmarks to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple text editing tasks while being competitive with much larger publicly available models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in the field of text editing using large language models:- It focuses specifically on using instruction tuning with diverse text editing tasks/benchmarks to improve model capabilities. Other works like PEER and DelITeraTeR have used text editing datasets but not focused on instruction tuning.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple text editing benchmarks using smaller models than comparable works. For example, it outperforms PEER and other large LLMs while using a model 60x smaller. This suggests the effectiveness of the dense task-specific instruction tuning.- It demonstrates stronger generalization capabilities than other models, including to unseen composite instructions. The instruction tuning allows it to understand new combinations of tasks.- The paper releases all code, data, and models publicly to support open research. Other related works like PEER and EdiT5 have not released their models publicly.- It incorporates a wider range of style editing tasks beyond just paraphrasing and neutralization which were tackled in some prior works like PEER. This includes formality, politeness, etc.- The work does not focus on meaning-changing edits that require external info. Some related works like PEER allow fact updates by incorporating external context. Overall, the key differentiation of this work seems to be in showing the effectiveness of task-specific instruction tuning on a dense set of focused text editing benchmarks compared to other approaches while also demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The public release of data and models is also a significant contribution to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring the compositional capabilities of instruction-tuned models further, such as investigating optimal orderings for chaining multiple instructions and expanding to longer text revisions.- Evaluating the models on more open-ended real-world text editing scenarios, beyond the current focus on sentence-level changes. This includes handling longer texts and more complex edits like fact updates.- Improving prompt engineering to make the models more robust to variations in instructions. The authors note prompt sensitivity as a limitation and suggest more controlled comparisons across different verbalizers.- Reducing computational requirements to make training and inference more accessible. The authors point out that the compute needed for models like GPT-3 and Flan could pose difficulties.- Studying social biases and potential harms from wording changes. While focused on non-meaning-changing edits, there is still a risk of introducing biases.- Expanding the notion of "adjacent tasks" to better characterize what edits the model can generalize to. The authors propose adjacent tasks are similar in nature to seen tasks.- Incorporating user studies to directly evaluate if the models improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the writing process. The authors suggest this but do not include direct user studies.In summary, the main suggestions involve improving compositional abilities, testing generalization, prompt engineering, reducing compute needs, studying social impacts, better defining adjacent tasks, and conducting user studies.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces CoEdIT, a text editing system for writing assistance that uses natural language instructions. CoEdIT is composed of instruction-tuned large language models that are fine-tuned on a parallel corpus of over 80,000 input-output pairs from text editing benchmark datasets. The inputs consist of natural language instructions such as "Paraphrase the sentence" prepending source texts, while the outputs are the edited target texts. The authors show that CoEdIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several text editing tasks including grammatical error correction, text simplification, and stylistic editing. It outperforms both supervised text editing models and general-purpose language models, despite being 60x smaller in size.
