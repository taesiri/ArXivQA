# [Zero-1-to-3: Zero-shot One Image to 3D Object](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11328)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can large-scale pretrained diffusion models like Stable Diffusion be fine-tuned to perform novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from a single input image in a zero-shot setting?

The key hypothesis appears to be that large diffusion models trained on internet-scale image datasets will have learned rich implicit 3D priors about objects, even though they were trained on 2D images without any 3D supervision. By fine-tuning the model on a dataset with known camera viewpoints, the authors aim to teach it to control relative camera transformations, unlocking the ability to manipulate viewpoint and perform 3D tasks from just 2D images.

The paper then demonstrates state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from single images by leveraging the strong geometric priors learned by the large-scale diffusion model. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples on complex shapes suggest the model has acquired a meaningful implicit understanding of 3D geometry and appearance from 2D internet photos alone.

In summary, the main research question is whether intrinsic 3D knowledge can be extracted from a 2D pretrained diffusion model to perform challenging 3D vision tasks in a zero-shot manner by teaching viewpoint controls. The results provide evidence that these models have learned surprisingly powerful geometric priors from unstructured 2D data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel approach called Zero-1-to-3 for zero-shot, single-image novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. 

- Demonstrating that large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have learned rich 3D priors about objects, even though they are trained on 2D images.

- Showing that these models can be fine-tuned to learn control mechanisms to manipulate camera viewpoints, enabling novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from a single image.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction benchmarks by leveraging the strong object shape priors learned by Stable Diffusion through large-scale pre-training.

- Demonstrating the ability to perform zero-shot novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction on diverse in-the-wild images, including paintings, by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a novel approach to extract 3D geometric priors from the large-scale 2D pre-training of diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, and using this to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on challenging 3D vision tasks from just a single RGB image input.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method to generate novel views of objects from a single input image by fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model to learn controls over relative camera viewpoint, enabling zero-shot novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper presents a novel approach for zero-shot, single image novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. The key idea is to leverage large pretrained diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, which contain rich implicit shape priors learned from internet-scale data. 

- Most prior work on single image 3D rely on explicit 3D supervision like meshes, voxels, or multiple views of the same object. In contrast, this paper shows impressive results by only finetuning a diffusion model on synthetic data without real 3D annotations.

- For view synthesis, this paper frames it as an image-to-image translation task with a diffusion model. This is different from common approaches based on optimizing neural radiance fields with clip losses. The diffusion approach allows sampling diversity and enables fast synthesis.

- Compared to concurrent work like NeRDi and Neural Lift that also use diffusion models for view synthesis, this paper demonstrates better generalization by learning explicit viewpoint controls on synthetic data rather than relying solely on language priors.

- The experiments convincingly demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks for both view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. The method also shows robustness to complex geometries and appearance by generalizing to paintings.

- An interesting direction is extending the approach to full scenes, videos, and combining it with graphics pipelines like relighting. The limitations are mainly the slow inference speed and degradation on cluttered backgrounds. But overall, the paper makes excellent progress on zero-shot generalization for 3D tasks with diffusion models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring ways to improve the generalization capability of the model from single objects to more complex scenes with backgrounds. The current approach is trained on isolated objects, so extending it to full scenes is noted as an important challenge.

- Adapting the approach to handle video input and 3D video generation. The authors mention recent diffusion models for video could potentially be extended to 3D to enable new applications like dynamic scene geometry estimation. 

- Combining graphics rendering techniques like relighting with the implicit knowledge learned by models like Stable Diffusion. The paper shows how to extract 3D knowledge, and suggests future work could extract other graphics knowledge to enable rendering effects.

- Speeding up the inference time of the diffusion process, which is slow currently. This will be important especially for video applications.

- Training the model on even larger and more diverse 3D asset datasets to improve generalization.

- Increasing the sampling of viewpoints per object during dataset creation. Currently only 12 views are rendered due to resource constraints.

- Using higher image resolution and latent dimension during training now that the batch size tuning has been figured out.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around improving generalization, extending to video and graphics applications, scaling up the training data/views, and speeding up inference. The authors seem to point to many exciting future directions building on top of the viewpoint control method presented.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Zero-1-to-3, a method for changing the camera viewpoint of an object given a single RGB image. The approach leverages the geometric priors learned by large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, which are trained on internet-scale image data and capture rich 3D information despite being trained only on 2D images. To extract this knowledge, the authors fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a synthetic dataset to teach it to control relative camera viewpoint as part of the image generation process. This allows encoding an input image and decoding it to a different specified camera view. Even though trained on synthetic data, the model shows strong generalization ability for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction on real images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The viewpoint-controllable diffusion model is shown to be useful both for directly synthesizing novel views of objects as well as for optimizing a 3D representation using a framework like Score Jacobian Chaining.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Zero-1-to-3 for generating novel views of objects from a single input image. The key idea is to leverage the rich semantic and geometric priors learned by large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, even though they are only trained on 2D images. To exploit the priors, the authors fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a synthetic dataset of paired images showing objects from different viewpoints. This allows the model to learn controls for relative camera rotation and translation which can be used to manipulate the viewpoint during image generation. 

The fine-tuned model is applied to two tasks: novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from a single image. For novel view synthesis, the conditioned diffusion model takes an input image and relative camera pose and generates the object from the specified viewpoint. For 3D reconstruction, the model is combined with a 3D distillation framework to create a voxel radiance field representing object shape and appearance. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both tasks compared to other zero-shot approaches, even on in-the-wild images outside the training distribution. The method effectively transfers the strong 2D priors from Stable Diffusion to 3D tasks by learning to control viewpoint as a conditional.
