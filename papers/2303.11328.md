# [Zero-1-to-3: Zero-shot One Image to 3D Object](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11328)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can large-scale pretrained diffusion models like Stable Diffusion be fine-tuned to perform novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from a single input image in a zero-shot setting?

The key hypothesis appears to be that large diffusion models trained on internet-scale image datasets will have learned rich implicit 3D priors about objects, even though they were trained on 2D images without any 3D supervision. By fine-tuning the model on a dataset with known camera viewpoints, the authors aim to teach it to control relative camera transformations, unlocking the ability to manipulate viewpoint and perform 3D tasks from just 2D images.

The paper then demonstrates state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from single images by leveraging the strong geometric priors learned by the large-scale diffusion model. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples on complex shapes suggest the model has acquired a meaningful implicit understanding of 3D geometry and appearance from 2D internet photos alone.

In summary, the main research question is whether intrinsic 3D knowledge can be extracted from a 2D pretrained diffusion model to perform challenging 3D vision tasks in a zero-shot manner by teaching viewpoint controls. The results provide evidence that these models have learned surprisingly powerful geometric priors from unstructured 2D data.
