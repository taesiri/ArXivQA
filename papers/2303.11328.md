# [Zero-1-to-3: Zero-shot One Image to 3D Object](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11328)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can large-scale pretrained diffusion models like Stable Diffusion be fine-tuned to perform novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from a single input image in a zero-shot setting?

The key hypothesis appears to be that large diffusion models trained on internet-scale image datasets will have learned rich implicit 3D priors about objects, even though they were trained on 2D images without any 3D supervision. By fine-tuning the model on a dataset with known camera viewpoints, the authors aim to teach it to control relative camera transformations, unlocking the ability to manipulate viewpoint and perform 3D tasks from just 2D images.

The paper then demonstrates state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from single images by leveraging the strong geometric priors learned by the large-scale diffusion model. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples on complex shapes suggest the model has acquired a meaningful implicit understanding of 3D geometry and appearance from 2D internet photos alone.

In summary, the main research question is whether intrinsic 3D knowledge can be extracted from a 2D pretrained diffusion model to perform challenging 3D vision tasks in a zero-shot manner by teaching viewpoint controls. The results provide evidence that these models have learned surprisingly powerful geometric priors from unstructured 2D data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel approach called Zero-1-to-3 for zero-shot, single-image novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. 

- Demonstrating that large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have learned rich 3D priors about objects, even though they are trained on 2D images.

- Showing that these models can be fine-tuned to learn control mechanisms to manipulate camera viewpoints, enabling novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from a single image.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction benchmarks by leveraging the strong object shape priors learned by Stable Diffusion through large-scale pre-training.

- Demonstrating the ability to perform zero-shot novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction on diverse in-the-wild images, including paintings, by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a novel approach to extract 3D geometric priors from the large-scale 2D pre-training of diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, and using this to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on challenging 3D vision tasks from just a single RGB image input.
