# [Efficiently Programming Large Language Models using SGLang](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07104)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Structured Generation Language (SGLang), a domain-specific language embedded in Python designed to facilitate the efficient programming of large language models (LLMs). SGLang provides intuitive primitives like extend, gen, fork/join for state management, generation control, and parallelism. The language runtime includes an interpreter, compiler and a high-performance serving engine called SGVM. A key innovation in SGVM is RadixAttention, which automatically reuses computation (the key-value cache) across chained generation calls by maintaining caches in a radix tree structure. Together, SGLang and SGVM simplify writing LLM programs while optimizing for low latency and high throughput. Experiments on few-shot learning, reasoning, content generation, agents and long document tasks demonstrate a speedup of up to 5x over baselines like LMQL, Guidance and vLLM. The system enables productive and efficient programming of LLMs for advanced applications like multi-step reasoning and complex workflows.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Structured Generation Language (SGLang), a domain-specific language and runtime system for efficiently programming large language models through techniques like automatic parallelism, batching, caching, and other compiler optimizations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of SGLang, an efficient programming system for large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1. SGLang is a domain-specific language embedded in Python that provides primitives designed for programming LLMs. These primitives allow for managing prompts, controlling parallelism, integrating with Python code, etc.

2. The paper presents an interpreter and a compiler for executing SGLang programs. The interpreter handles asynchronous prompt streams and intra-program parallelism. The compiler can optimize SGLang programs through techniques like graph rewriting. 

3. The paper proposes RadixAttention, a novel technique to automatically reuse key-value caches across LLM generation calls to reduce redundant computation. This is implemented in the SGLang runtime system SGVM.

4. Evaluations demonstrate SGLang can accelerate common LLM workloads by up to 5x compared to existing systems. The efficiency comes from effectively exploiting parallelism, sharing, batching, caching, and other optimizations enabled by the co-design of the language and runtime system.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the SGLang programming system for LLMs, which simplifies LLM application development and significantly improves performance.
