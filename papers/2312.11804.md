# [Gravity-aware Grasp Generation with Implicit Grasp Mode Selection for   Underactuated Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Parallel-jaw grippers have limited grasp capability due to only two small contact surfaces. They are fragile against torque which can cause grasp failure.  
- Underactuated hands can enable both precision and more stable power grasps, but grasp generation is harder for them.

Proposed Solution:
- A gravity-aware grasp generator that supports both precision and power grasps for underactuated hands.
- Proposes a data generation pipeline that evaluates grasps under disturbance forces in multiple directions first. Then projects the multi-dimensional disturbance scores to gravity direction for training scenes.
- Uses two network heads - one for gravity-rejection score regression to encourage power grasps, and one for success/fail classification to reject invalid collisions.
- Proposes a physically meaningful grasp orientation representation based on rotation matrix and priority of basis vectors.

Key Contributions:
- Gravity-aware data generation pipeline with disturbance-rejection scores.
- Dual network heads for power grasp prioritization and collision avoidance.
- Novel rotation representation for accurate orientation regression. 
- Simulation and real robot experiments that demonstrate significant improvements over baseline, especially for heavy objects.

In summary, the paper presents a learning framework to leverage capabilities of underactuated hands for robust precision and power grasps. The data generation and dual network heads enable automatic, gravity-aware grasp mode selection. Experiments highlight advantages for grasping heavy everyday objects.
