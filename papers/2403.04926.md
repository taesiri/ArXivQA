# [BAGS: Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting through Multi-Scale Kernel   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Recent scene reconstruction methods using 3D Gaussians can achieve impressive results, but struggle with real-world images that contain blur, such as from camera motion, defocus, or inconsistent resolutions. Gaussian splatting methods tend to overfit to such blurry training data, producing noisy scenes. In contrast, neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can smooth out such inconsistencies but are slower to optimize.

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS), which adds 2D blur modeling on top of a 3D Gaussian scene representation to handle blurry training views. Specifically:

1) A Blur Proposal Network (BPN) is introduced to model a per-pixel convolution kernel and mask. BPN considers position, view direction, color, and depth features to capture spatial, color, and depth variations related to blur. The mask highlights probable blurry regions. 

2) A coarse-to-fine optimization scheme starts by optimizing lower-resolution kernels/training views, then gradually increases scale to avoid ambiguity and improve efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- BPN to model dense per-pixel convolution kernels and identify blurry regions, improving over sparse/global blur assumptions.

- Coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme for improved efficiency and handling ambiguity between 3D scene and 2D blur.  

- State-of-the-art scene reconstruction results under motion blur, defocus blur, and mixed resolutions. Useful for real-world images.

- Interpretable kernels and masks that characterize type and location of image blur to evaluate training view quality.

In summary, BAGS introduces explicit 2D blur modeling to make Gaussian splatting scene reconstruction robust to real-world blurry views, outperforming NeRF alternatives while remaining efficient. The estimated kernels and masks also provide insight into image degradation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

BAGS introduces a blur proposal network and coarse-to-fine optimization scheme to enable robust 3D scene reconstruction from blurry images using Gaussian splatting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized in three parts:

1. It introduces a Blur Proposal Network (BPN), which considers spatial, depth, and color variations of the scene to model image blur. BPN can also produce a mask that indicates blurry regions in an input image.

2. It introduces a coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme, which gradually increases the training image resolution and the estimated kernel size with additional neural network layers. This improves the stability of the joint optimization process given a sparse point cloud initialization.  

3. It evaluates the overall proposed method, called Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS), on three image blur scenarios (camera motion blur, defocus blur, mixed resolution) and shows significant quantitative and visual improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing BAGS, a novel 3D reconstruction method based on Gaussian splatting that can handle various types of blur and degradeations in the input images, through the use of a blur proposal network and a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme.
