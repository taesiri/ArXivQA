# [What Was Your Prompt? A Remote Keylogging Attack on AI Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09751)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces a novel side-channel attack on encrypted traffic from AI assistants. The key contributions are:

1) Identifying a new token-length side-channel inherent in how AI assistants stream token responses in real-time. This allows attackers to infer token lengths from encrypted packet sizes. 

2) Proposing the first token inference attack that uses a fine-tuned neural language model to translate token-length sequences into full sentences, exploiting long-distance relationships in text.

3) Demonstrating techniques to reconstruct entire paragraphs by considering inter-sentence context and exploiting the predictable style of AI assistants. 

4) Evaluating the attack on services from OpenAI and Microsoft, successfully inferring the content of encrypted responses through token sequences extracted from network traffic.

In summary, the paper exposes a significant vulnerability in major AI assistants and shows that generative AI can be effectively weaponized to breach confidentiality using side-channels. The attack methodology and implications are the key innovations presented.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Token-length side-channel: The paper identifies a novel side channel in encrypted traffic from AI assistants based on the length of tokens (akin to words) transmitted sequentially. This reveals a vulnerability.  

- Token inference attack: The method proposed to exploit the token-length side-channel by using a large language model to translate the token lengths back into sentences and full responses.

- AI assistants: The services found vulnerable to the attack, such as chatbots from vendors like OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Microsoft (Copilot).

- Encrypted traffic analysis: The paper analyzes and infers information from encrypted network packets through side channels.

- Generative AI security: The use of generative models like LLMs to perform side-channel attacks highlights risks related to malicious uses of AI.

- Privacy and confidentiality: The attack compromises the privacy of AI assistant users by exposing confidential conversations.

- Mitigation strategies: Methods discussed like adding padding and batching responses to address the vulnerability.

So in summary, the key ideas involve using generative AI in a novel token inference attack to expose a dangerous side-channel in popular AI assistant services, highlighting privacy risks. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate token-length sequences back into legible sentences. What considerations were made in selecting and fine-tuning the LLM architecture to handle this novel task? Were certain model attributes or architectures better suited?

2. The method relies on providing context from previously inferred sentences to help narrow down the search space when translating subsequent token-length sequences. What techniques could be used to further expand on this context and provide even more relevant information to aid the LLM? 

3. The paper introduces a segmentation heuristic to split token-length sequences into sentence-like chunks. What additional linguistic features could this segmentation process consider to even better approximate sentence boundaries? How might the errors propagate?

4. When attacking the vendors' services, the method handles issues like unknown preamble sizes and token grouping. What other real-world complexities like lost packets or out-of-order delivery might impact the attack and how could the method address them?

5. For the ranking process, could more advanced strategies like beam search be used instead of sampling? What tradeoffs would this introduce?

6. The method proposes a known-plaintext attack by collecting example responses from the target model. What other sources of known-plaintext could further improve attack performance? 

7. What defenses could vendors implement to protect against this attack, and how might the attack method evolve to overcome them? Are there fundamental ways to eliminate the side-channel?

8. How does the choice of segmentation point impact the ability for the LLM to leverage long-distance relationships? Is there an optimal threshold?

9. The attack utilizes transfer learning by training the models on one service's data and attacking another. What factors drive this transferability between services and how can it be measured?

10. Beyond AI assistants, what other LLM services might be vulnerable? Could this attack work on large generative models like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion?
