# [An evaluation of Deep Learning based stereo dense matching dataset shift   from aerial images and a large scale stereo dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12522)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Dense image matching is crucial for 3D reconstruction but generating ground truth disparity maps from real scenes is challenging, especially for aerial photogrammetry. 
- Deep learning methods depend heavily on training data quality and quantity but such data is scarce in aerial photogrammetry.  
- Dataset shift is an issue when applying models trained on available datasets to new unseen aerial images.

Methodology:
- Proposes a method to generate training data (epipolar images + corresponding sparse disparity maps) for aerial images using aerial images and LiDAR point clouds.
- Refines image-LiDAR registration to improve consistency. Handles occlusions and scene changes.  
- Evaluates 11 methods (traditional, machine learning and deep learning) on 6 datasets across different locations, resolutions, scene types.
- Studies influence of base-to-height ratio and dataset shift across locations and resolutions.

Main Contributions:
- Releases a large aerial dataset for training and benchmarking stereo dense matching methods.
- Proposes efficient LiDAR-image registration and filtering techniques to improve data consistency.  
- Provides extensive experiments and analysis on aerial dataset shift for various stereo matching methods.
- Finds PSMNet shows robustness across datasets while GANet works best when training/testing data identical.
- Concludes on optimal training strategies under dataset shift constraints.

In summary, the paper tackles the issue of limited availability of aerial image training data through a method to efficiently generate such data. It then leverages this to study dataset shift for learning-based dense matching techniques, vital for their adoption in aerial photogrammetry.
