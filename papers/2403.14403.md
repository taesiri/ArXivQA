# [Adaptive-RAG: Learning to Adapt Retrieval-Augmented Large Language   Models through Question Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) tend to use either a single-step retrieval approach which is insufficient for complex queries, or a multi-step iterative retrieval approach which is inefficient for simple queries. However, real-world QA scenarios involve both simple and complex queries, demanding an adaptive framework. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Adaptive-RAG, an adaptive retrieval-augmented generation framework that can dynamically select the most suitable LLM QA strategy based on the complexity of the input query. It adapts among three strategies: non-retrieval for straightforward queries answerable by the LLM itself; single-step retrieval for moderate queries; and multi-step iterative retrieval for complex queries. 

The core component is a classifier that predicts the complexity level ('A'-non-retrieval, 'B'-single retrieval, 'C'-multi retrieval) of the input query. It is trained on automatically labeled data derived from model prediction outcomes and dataset biases. Based on this classified complexity, Adaptive-RAG seamlessly switches between the three LLM QA strategies without any architectural changes.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies limitations of existing one-size-fits-all retrieval-augmented LLM QA approaches 
- Proposes a novel framework Adaptive-RAG that can adaptively select QA strategies tailored to varying query complexities
- Introduces an automatic query complexity classifier that directs strategy selection
- Demonstrates enhanced efficiency and accuracy over both simple and complex QA datasets
- Provides an effective middle ground between complex multi-hop and simple single-hop QA strategies

The key insight is that adapting the LLM QA pipeline based on query complexity allows optimally balancing accuracy and efficiency. The classifier is vital for operationalizing this adaptation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an adaptive framework called Adaptive-RAG that can dynamically select the most suitable strategy from a range of retrieval-augmented language models based on the complexity of the input question in order to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of question answering systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Adaptive-RAG, an adaptive retrieval-augmented generation framework for question answering. Specifically, Adaptive-RAG can dynamically select the most suitable strategy from a range of retrieval-augmented language models tailored to the complexity level of the input query. This includes using no retrieval for simple queries, single-step retrieval for moderate queries, and multi-step iterative retrieval for complex queries. A key component is a classifier that predicts the complexity level of incoming queries, which is trained on automatically labeled data. Experiments show Adaptive-RAG enhances the overall efficiency and accuracy of QA systems compared to one-size-fits-all retrieval augmentation approaches. The main contributions are:

1) Pointing out most existing retrieval augmented QA models are either overly simple or complex to handle diverse real-world queries. 

2) Proposing Adaptive-RAG to adaptively select suitable strategies ranging from no to multi-step retrieval based on query complexity.

3) Designing a classifier to assess query complexity, trained on automatically labeled data.  

4) Demonstrating improved efficiency and accuracy over strong baselines on both single and multi-hop QA datasets.

The paper proposes an adaptive framework called "Adaptive-RAG" that can select the most suitable strategy for retrieval-augmented large language models based on the complexity of the input query. This allows dynamically adapting between different strategies ranging from no retrieval to single-step to multi-step iterative retrieval. A key component is the classifier that determines query complexity, which is trained on automatically labeled data. Experiments on open-domain QA datasets with varying query complexity demonstrate enhanced efficiency and accuracy compared to prior approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Adaptive-RAG framework determine which retrieval-augmented strategy to use for a given query? What are the different strategies it chooses between and what factors does it consider when making this decision?

2. What novel components enable the Adaptive-RAG framework to smoothly transition between different retrieval-augmented strategies without changing the underlying model architectures or parameters? 

3. What techniques does the paper propose for automatically generating training data to train the query complexity classifier, without reliance on human annotations? What are the limitations of these techniques?

4. How does the design of the query complexity classifier compare to more complex classifier architectures? What performance tradeoffs result from using a smaller language model for the classifier?

5. In what ways could the automated query complexity labeling strategies result in errors? What future work could be done to improve the labeling process?

6. Why is having both single-hop and multi-hop QA datasets important for evaluating the Adaptive-RAG framework? How does performance differ when only one dataset type is used?

7. What customizations need to be made to the retrieval and reader modules in order to tailor them for single-step versus multi-step retrieval strategies?

8. What characteristics of the GPT-3.5 model make the proposed adaptive framework particularly beneficial compared to other LLMs?

9. How sensitive is overall QA performance to errors made by the query complexity classifier? What is the upper bound estimate provided by using an oracle classifier?

10. What steps would need to be taken to deploy the Adaptive-RAG system in a real-world application? How could offensive or inappropriate content in retrieved documents be prevented or managed?
