# [DP-RDM: Adapting Diffusion Models to Private Domains Without Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14421)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image diffusion models can suffer from sample-level memorization, reproducing near-perfect replicas of images from their training set. This is undesirable and poses privacy risks. Differential privacy (DP) can mitigate this issue but current DP image generation methods rely on fine-tuning the model, which is computationally expensive and does not scale well.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model (DP-RDM) that adapts to new domains privately without any fine-tuning. Their method assumes access to a text-to-image diffusion model pre-trained on public data. At inference time, they use a novel differentially private k-nearest neighbors retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private dataset. Gaussian noise is added to the aggregated retrieved samples to ensure DP. The interpolated retrieved embeddings are then used to condition the generation process.

Main Contributions:

- Show privacy risks of using private data in standard retrieval-augmented diffusion models 

- Propose a DP retrieval-augmented diffusion model (DP-RDM) with rigorous DP guarantees that mitigates these risks

- DP-RDM adapts to new private domains without any fine-tuning by simply changing the private retrieval dataset 

- Evaluate DP-RDM on CIFAR-10, MS-COCO and a large-scale private dataset with 239M images. It generates high quality images at a privacy cost of Îµ=10 for up to 10,000 queries.

- Analysis shows the privacy-utility trade-off of DP-RDM improves significantly by scaling up the retrieval dataset, enabling the use of very large private datasets.

In summary, the authors develop the first differentially private retrieval-augmented text-to-image generation method that adapts to private domains without needing infeasible fine-tuning. Their method advances state-of-the-art in DP image generation.
