# [Unsupervised Compositional Concepts Discovery with Text-to-Image   Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05357)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can we develop an unsupervised approach to discover the generative concepts that represent the content of a collection of images?The key hypothesis is that by leveraging large pre-trained text-to-image generative models like diffusion models, the authors can decompose images into meaningful compositional concepts without any supervision or labels. Specifically, the paper investigates decomposing images into probability distributions that capture global scene attributes like lighting as well as local concepts like objects. The goal is to show that these discovered concepts can accurately represent image content, be recombined to generate new images, and serve as effective representations for tasks like classification.In summary, the central research question is about unsupervised discovery of visual concepts from images using text-to-image models, with the hypothesis that this will enable representing, recombining, and reasoning about visual content.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents an unsupervised approach to discovering compositional generative concepts from images. Most prior work on concept discovery has focused on discovering latent directions in a supervised manner or discovering objects represented as segmentation masks. This paper extends the work of COMET by representing concepts with diffusion models, enabling decomposition of high-resolution natural images.- The approach leverages recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models to parameterize the concepts using word embeddings. This provides a more efficient way to discover concepts compared to learning representations from scratch. Using the semantic space of text also helps resolve ambiguity in factoring images.- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised concept discovery across diverse domains like artistic paintings, indoor scenes, and ImageNet images. Both global and local concepts are effectively discovered, e.g. painting styles and objects/lighting in scenes.- Discovered concepts are shown to be useful for downstream tasks like generating creative hybrid images and as representations for image classification. Most prior work has focused just on image manipulation applications.- Compared to COMET, this work scales to high-resolution natural images by utilizing recent diffusion models. COMET was primarily demonstrated on simpler datasets. Textual inversion is also extended from learning one concept per set of images to multiple concepts simultaneously.- Overall, the paper makes contributions in developing a scalable approach for unsupervised concept discovery on realistic images, showing strong quantitative and qualitative results. It also expands applications of discovered concepts. The use of pre-trained text-to-image models is a practical way to learn reusable representations.In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in unsupervised visual concept discovery by effectively utilizing advancements in generative modeling. The concepts prove useful for creative generation and representation learning.
