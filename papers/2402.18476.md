# [IBD: Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via   Image-Biased Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance on various vision-language tasks. However, they suffer from a critical issue - generating textual hallucinations (incorrect or irrelevant information) mainly due to over-reliance on linguistic priors rather than visual information. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel image-biased decoding (IBD) technique to address hallucinations in LVLMs. 

- IBD computes next-token probabilities by contrasting predictions from a standard LVLM ($\theta$) and an image-biased LVLM ($\hat{\theta}$) that focuses more on visual input. This amplifies probabilities of tokens related to image content while mitigating errors from textual over-reliance.

- A dynamic adjustment mechanism is introduced to handle different types of words flexibly. For function words or words with high prediction similarity between $\theta$ and $\hat{\theta}$, IBD relies more on standard decoding to prevent performance drops.

Main Contributions:
- Conducts statistical analysis to validate the correlation between high CD score words and correct words, verifying reliability of the proposed contrastive decoding. 

- Proposes a lightweight and efficient solution only requiring minimal extra parameters for prompt tuning, without needing additional training data or models.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics compared to previous decoding methods, demonstrating effectiveness of IBD in alleviating hallucinations and enhancing truthfulness.

In summary, the key innovation is an image-biased decoding technique along with comprehensive analyses and adaptive designs to address the pressing challenge of hallucinations faced by LVLMs today.
