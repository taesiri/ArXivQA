# [Skater: A Novel Bi-modal Bi-copter Robot for Adaptive Locomotion in Air   and Diverse Terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01991)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing aerial-ground robots struggle to achieve good mobility in both aerial and ground modes due to design limitations. Integrating flying and driving mechanisms into one robot leads to increased size and weight, reducing flight efficiency. 
- Quadrotors used in many designs have limited steering ability on the ground. Robots with active wheels rely heavily on ground friction and can slip on low-friction surfaces.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose a novel aerial-ground robot called "Skater" based on a longitudinally-arranged bi-copter with two passive wheels on the sides. 
- This design has a very compact structure for good aerial mobility and terrain traversability. The bi-copter configuration generates strong steering torques to actively produce centripetal forces, enabling stable motion even on slippery ground.

Contributions:
- Configuration design analysis showing the bi-copter with longitudinal motion provides minimum width and best steering capacity compared to multicopters.
- Unified dynamic model and differential flatness analysis for both aerial and ground modes.
- Nonlinear MPC controller for seamless and accurate trajectory tracking in both locomotion modes.  
- Real world experiments demonstrating 85.8% energy savings in ground mode, adaptive ground mobility, narrow gap traversal, and superior performance over a quadrotor robot.

In summary, the paper presents a novel robot design, modeling, and control for adaptive aerial-ground locomotion on diverse surfaces, with real-world validation of energy efficiency, trajectory tracking, and benchmark comparisons highlighting the advantages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel bi-modal bi-copter robot with passive wheels, called Skater, which leverages its vectored thrust capability to achieve stable movement and accurate trajectory tracking in both aerial and ground modes across diverse terrains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel bi-modal bi-copter robot called Skater that is adaptable to air and various ground surfaces. It has a compact and lightweight mechanism while possessing exceptional terrain traversing capability and strong steering capacity.

2) Modeling the comprehensive dynamics of Skater and analyzing its differential flatness characteristic. This benefits motion planning and tracking control. 

3) Proposing a unified nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that achieves accurate tracking of aerial and ground trajectories and seamless modal switching between the two locomotion modes.

4) Conducting extensive real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons that demonstrate Skater's outstanding performance in traversing diverse terrains and the effectiveness of the proposed NMPC controller.

In summary, the key contribution is the design, modeling, control, and experimental validation of the novel Skater robot for adaptive locomotion in air and on various ground surfaces. The paper shows Skater has better terrain adaptability compared to other aerial-ground robots.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Aerial-ground robot: The paper presents a robot that can operate in both aerial (flying) mode and ground (driving/rolling) mode.

- Bi-copter: The flying mechanism of the robot is a bi-copter, meaning it has two rotors. This is chosen over a quadcopter for its better maneuverability and narrower size.

- Passive wheels: The ground locomotion uses two passive wheels on the sides, driven by the rotor thrust rather than separate motors. This saves weight and energy.

- Traversability: A key focus is developing a robot with good terrain traversability - the ability to navigate different surfaces like rough or slippery ground.

- Steering capability: The bi-copter configuration gives the robot better steering ability compared to quadcopter-based robots.

- Unified actuation: Using the bi-copter for both flying and driving allows a unified actuation system across modes.

- Dynamics modeling: The paper models the dual-mode dynamics of the robot.

- Differential flatness: This property is analyzed to enable trajectory tracking control.

- Nonlinear MPC: A nonlinear model predictive control method is used for robust trajectory tracking in both modes.

- Benchmarking: Experiments compare performance to other quadcopter-based aerial-ground robots.
