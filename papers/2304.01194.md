# [Burstormer: Burst Image Restoration and Enhancement Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01194)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective framework for aligning, aggregating and enhancing complementary information from multiple burst images to generate a high-quality composite image?The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:- Proposing Burstormer, a new transformer-based architecture for burst image restoration and enhancement.- Introducing an enhanced deformable alignment (EDA) module that aligns multi-scale features from burst images with implicit deformation modeling. - Incorporating reference-frame based feature enrichment in EDA to refine aligned features.- Progressive feature aggregation in the reconstruction stage through cyclic burst sampling neighborhoods and burst feature fusion.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of Burstormer on various burst processing tasks like super-resolution, denoising and low-light enhancement.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging transformers for multi-scale feature alignment and adaptive fusion of burst images can lead to better composite image quality compared to prior arts. The paper presents Burstormer framework as a novel instantiation of this idea and shows its effectiveness empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a new transformer-based architecture called Burstormer for burst image restoration and enhancement. - An enhanced deformable alignment (EDA) module that handles misalignment issues among burst frames using multi-scale hierarchical alignment and reference-based feature enrichment.- A no-reference feature enrichment (NRFE) module that enables flexible inter-frame communication and progressive feature aggregation for image reconstruction using cyclic burst sampling and burst feature fusion units.- Achieving state-of-the-art results on burst super-resolution, burst denoising, and burst low-light enhancement while being computationally efficient compared to prior methods. - Providing detailed ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EDA and NRFE modules.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a new transformer-based Burstormer network architecture that leverages multi-scale alignment and flexible feature aggregation for high-quality burst image processing. The design choices are validated through extensive experiments and analysis.
