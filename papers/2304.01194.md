# [Burstormer: Burst Image Restoration and Enhancement Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01194)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective framework for aligning, aggregating and enhancing complementary information from multiple burst images to generate a high-quality composite image?The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:- Proposing Burstormer, a new transformer-based architecture for burst image restoration and enhancement.- Introducing an enhanced deformable alignment (EDA) module that aligns multi-scale features from burst images with implicit deformation modeling. - Incorporating reference-frame based feature enrichment in EDA to refine aligned features.- Progressive feature aggregation in the reconstruction stage through cyclic burst sampling neighborhoods and burst feature fusion.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of Burstormer on various burst processing tasks like super-resolution, denoising and low-light enhancement.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging transformers for multi-scale feature alignment and adaptive fusion of burst images can lead to better composite image quality compared to prior arts. The paper presents Burstormer framework as a novel instantiation of this idea and shows its effectiveness empirically.
