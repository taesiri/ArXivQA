# [Stealing Stable Diffusion Prior for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05056)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Stealing Stable Diffusion Prior for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation":

Problem:
- Monocular depth estimation is important for applications like autonomous driving, but performs poorly in challenging conditions like darkness or adverse weather. 
- Existing methods either have complex tailored pipelines limiting reasoning/adapting to diverse conditions, or use GANs for image translation which lack diversity and generalizability.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new paradigm named "Stealing Stable Diffusion (SSD) Prior" that utilizes stable diffusion for robust monocular depth estimation.
- Introduce a Generative Diffusion Model-based Translation (GDT) module that leverages stable diffusion, control networks, and vision transformers to translate day images to challenging night/rain conditions while preserving depth.
- Employ a self-training strategy where a teacher network trained on clean data provides guidance to a student network trained on additional generated challenging samples. 
- Integrate DINOv2 encoder to extract robust features, add semantic loss for alignment, and propose a teacher loss to prevent erroneous knowledge transfer during self-training distillation.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce stable diffusion into robust monocular depth estimation and propose a general paradigm utilizing the diffusion prior.
- Present a plug-and-play GDT translation model based on generative diffusion models that can readily apply to diverse conditions. 
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Oxford RobotCar datasets, demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework for robust depth estimation that leverages stable diffusion through image translation and self-training. Key innovations include the GDT module and losses for improved feature extraction and knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments validate the approach's efficacy.
