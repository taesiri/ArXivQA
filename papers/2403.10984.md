# [IoTCO2: Assessing the End-To-End Carbon Footprint of   Internet-of-Things-Enabled Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- IoT devices running deep learning inferences are projected to contribute significantly to global carbon emissions in the coming years. 
- Existing tools for estimating carbon footprint have limitations in accurately assessing the operational (usage) and embodied (manufacturing) carbon footprints of IoT devices performing deep learning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces \carb, a novel end-to-end modeling tool for precisely estimating the carbon footprint of IoT-enabled deep learning.

Key Contributions:
- Accurate estimator for operational carbon footprint that accounts for model quantization and emerging neural processing units (NPUs).
- Precise estimator for embodied carbon footprint covering both computing and non-computing hardware components in IoT devices.
- Overall, \carb demonstrates a maximum Â±21% deviation from actual measurements in carbon footprint values across various deep learning models and IoT devices.
- The paper validates \carb's operational and embodied carbon footprint models separately.
- Case studies using \carb showcase its utility for analyzing total carbon emissions of IoT devices and suggest measures like using NPUs, recycled casings and PCBs to mitigate carbon footprint.

In summary, the key innovation is the \carb modeling tool that can accurately estimate the end-to-end carbon footprint of Internet-of-Things devices running deep learning inferences. This can help understand and reduce the carbon impact of the proliferating IoT-enabled AI applications.
