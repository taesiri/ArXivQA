Key Contributions:
- Accurate estimator for operational carbon footprint that accounts for model quantization and emerging neural processing units (NPUs).
- Precise estimator for embodied carbon footprint covering both computing and non-computing hardware components in IoT devices.
- Overall, \carb demonstrates a maximum ±21% deviation from actual measurements in carbon footprint values across various deep learning models and IoT devices.
- The paper validates \carb's operational and embodied carbon footprint models separately.
- Case studies using \carb showcase its utility for analyzing total carbon emissions of IoT devices and suggest measures like using NPUs, recycled casings and PCBs to mitigate carbon footprint.

In summary, the key innovation is the \carb modeling tool that can accurately estimate the end-to-end carbon footprint of Internet-of-Things devices running deep learning inferences. This can help understand and reduce the carbon impact of the proliferating IoT-enabled AI applications.
