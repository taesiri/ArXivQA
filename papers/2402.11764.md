## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit harmful social biases which can perpetuate discrimination when deployed in real-world applications.  
- Debiasing LLMs is challenging due to high computational costs of retraining, potential degradation of capabilities, and data constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to generate synthetic training data for debiasing by prompting ChatGPT. 
- Two strategies are proposed - Targeted Prompting focuses on a specific bias category but requires prior specification of the bias. General Prompting does not require prior bias specification but is slightly less effective.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates ChatGPT can efficiently produce high-quality synthetic data for debiasing other LLMs.
- The synthetic data surpasses performance of existing datasets on debiasing while preserving capabilities.
- Shows generalizability across models (GPT-2, BERT) and bias categories (gender, race, religion).
- Targeted Prompting reduces bias by average of 7.9-10.2% on GPT-2, General by 5.1-5.3%.
- Training is up to 60 times faster than using existing Wikipedia-based datasets.
- Promising results in mitigating intersectional biases related to race and gender.

In summary, the paper introduces an approach to generate synthetic debiasing data via ChatGPT, which is more efficient and performs better than existing datasets. The data exhibits broad generalizability across models and bias categories while preserving capabilities. This demonstrates the potential of synthetic data to advance fairness in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces two novel methods for using ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data for efficiently debiasing large language models, demonstrates their effectiveness at mitigating bias while preserving language capabilities across models like GPT-2 and BERT, and analyzes the trade-offs between targeted vs general prompting strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach for generating synthetic training data via targeted and general prompting of ChatGPT to enhance the debiasing of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Introducing two strategies for synthetic data generation using ChatGPT prompts: targeted prompting which provides superior debiasing for known bias categories but requires prior specification of the bias, and general prompting which offers debiasing across categories without needing prior knowledge of the bias.

2) Demonstrating that the synthetic data generated using these strategies improves debiasing performance of LLMs like GPT-2 and BERT compared to existing datasets, while preserving the models' language capabilities.

3) Showing that the synthetic data exhibits generalizability by effectively mitigating various biases, including intersectional ones, across different GPT-2 family models. 

4) Highlighting the efficiency of the approach, with the synthetic data achieving better debiasing using much less data compared to Wikipedia-based baselines from prior work.

In summary, the key contribution is leveraging ChatGPT prompting to generate customized synthetic data that bolsters parameter-efficient debiasing methods for LLMs by enhancing effectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency.

The paper introduces approaches to generate synthetic training data using ChatGPT to enhance the debiasing of large language models. It proposes targeted prompting and general prompting strategies to create this synthetic data. The effectiveness of these data generation techniques paired with adapter tuning for debiasing is evaluated, considering metrics like bias reduction across categories like gender, race, and religion as well as preservation of language model skills.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes two strategies for generating synthetic debiasing data - targeted prompting and general prompting. What are the key differences between these two strategies and what are the trade-offs involved in using one versus the other? 

2. The targeted prompting strategy requires prior knowledge of the specific bias category to target. What are some ways to systematically identify priority bias categories when debiasing a model? How might this process introduce its own biases?

3. The general prompting strategy does not require specifying a particular bias category. What techniques does this strategy use to encourage ChatGPT to generate broadly debiasing sentences? How effective is this approach compared to targeted prompting?

4. The paper finds synthetic targeted data is usually more effective for debiasing than synthetic general data. Why might this be the case? What factors likely contribute to the targeted data's superior debiasing capability?  

5. For debiasing the BERT model, the paper introduces an additional strategy called loss-guided prompting. Why was this strategy needed for BERT but not GPT-2? What issues was it aiming to address?

6. The paper reports a trade-off between debiasing performance and preservation of language model capabilities, especially for BERT. What might explain this trade-off? How does the loss-guided prompting strategy aim to mitigate it?

7. What analyses did the paper conduct to evaluate whether the synthetic debiasing data was simply reproducing sentences from existing bias test sets rather than introducing novel debiasing data? How convincing are these analyses? 

8. The paper shows the synthetic data can debias multiple categories of bias including intersectional ones. What particular intersectional bias category did they target and why is mitigating intersectional biases uniquely challenging?

9. The paper claims 60x faster training using synthetic versus Wikipedia debiasing data. What factors contribute to the greater efficiency of synthetic data generation and use? Are there any downsides?

10. The approach relies on ChatGPT which has its own limitations. What contingencies does the paper suggest if ChatGPT's capabilities for debiasing data generation become lacking in the future as LLMs continue advancing?
