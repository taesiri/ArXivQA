# [ChatGPT Based Data Augmentation for Improved Parameter-Efficient   Debiasing of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit harmful social biases which can perpetuate discrimination when deployed in real-world applications.  
- Debiasing LLMs is challenging due to high computational costs of retraining, potential degradation of capabilities, and data constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to generate synthetic training data for debiasing by prompting ChatGPT. 
- Two strategies are proposed - Targeted Prompting focuses on a specific bias category but requires prior specification of the bias. General Prompting does not require prior bias specification but is slightly less effective.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates ChatGPT can efficiently produce high-quality synthetic data for debiasing other LLMs.
- The synthetic data surpasses performance of existing datasets on debiasing while preserving capabilities.
- Shows generalizability across models (GPT-2, BERT) and bias categories (gender, race, religion).
- Targeted Prompting reduces bias by average of 7.9-10.2% on GPT-2, General by 5.1-5.3%.
- Training is up to 60 times faster than using existing Wikipedia-based datasets.
- Promising results in mitigating intersectional biases related to race and gender.

In summary, the paper introduces an approach to generate synthetic debiasing data via ChatGPT, which is more efficient and performs better than existing datasets. The data exhibits broad generalizability across models and bias categories while preserving capabilities. This demonstrates the potential of synthetic data to advance fairness in LLMs.
