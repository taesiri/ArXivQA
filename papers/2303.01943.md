# [Spring: A High-Resolution High-Detail Dataset and Benchmark for Scene   Flow, Optical Flow and Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to create a new benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology to enable improved performance and analysis of scene flow, optical flow, and stereo estimation methods for high-resolution imagery containing fine details. 

The key hypotheses are:

- Current datasets and evaluation methodologies are insufficient for assessing the performance of recent methods that can estimate high amounts of detail. They lack high-resolution input data and ground truth containing small-scale details.

- By rendering photo-realistic high-definition image sequences from the Blender open movie "Spring" and generating corresponding super-resolved ultra-high-definition ground truth with 4 values per pixel, it is possible to create a new benchmark that represents fine details more accurately.

- This new benchmark with high-detail data and evaluation can provide valuable insights into the performance of state-of-the-art matching methods, particularly their limitations in estimating fine structures and generalizing across different datasets.

- Making such a large, high-quality benchmark publicly available can drive further progress in scene flow, optical flow and stereo research by enabling the development of more robust and detailed estimation methods.

In summary, the key research question is how to design a new benchmark to test the ability of current methods to estimate high-resolution motion and depth containing small-scale details, using both appropriate data and evaluation methodology. The hypotheses aim to demonstrate the value of such a benchmark and provide initial analysis of existing methods.
