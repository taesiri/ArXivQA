# [Understanding Missingness in Time-series Electronic Health Records for   Individualized Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) tend to have a high rate of missingness, up to 80% in ICU settings. However, most machine learning models that utilize EHRs make the assumption that data is missing completely at random (MCAR). This fails to take into account potentially informative patterns in missingness that could be valuable for personalized predictive models.

- Simple binary missingness masks, which just indicate if a value is observed or missing at a timestep, lack nuance about the patterns and frequency of missingness that vary at an individual level. They also fail to distinguish between general missingness and feature-wise missingness of certain variables that are only measured for patients with suspected specific conditions. 

- Population level imputation techniques can introduce bias and fail to represent data distributions at the level of individual patients. They assume missing values are "missing completely at random".

Solution:
- The authors propose that new methods need to move beyond simply assuming MCAR and instead find ways to represent and learn from patterns of missingness in EHR data that provide insights at an individual level.

- As an example solution, they highlight recent work on the IGNITE model which introduces a frequency-based "Individualized Missingness Mask" to capture patterns of measurement frequency across time for each patient. This better enables generative models to produce personalized imputations tailored to a patient's missingness profile.

Contributions:
- Provides real-world examples and insights that challenge assumptions about MCAR in EHR data, highlighting the need to represent informative missingness.

- Argues for a perspective shift to view imputation and learning from missingness as integral to predictive modeling tasks, not just a preprocessing step.

- Highlights the promise of emerging techniques like IGNITE that focus specifically on generating personalized imputations based on patterns of observed and missing data unique to individual patients in EHR datasets.
