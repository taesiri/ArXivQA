# [Interpreting Context Look-ups in Transformers: Investigating   Attention-MLP Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15055)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have shown impressive capabilities, however there is still limited understanding of their inner workings. Gaining deeper insight can facilitate safer deployment, interpretability, debiasing, and control. 
- Specifically, the roles and interactions between attention heads and MLP components have not been fully characterized. The paper aims to elucidate this relationship and shed light on the transformer's text generation process.

Proposed Solution  
- Associate attention heads with specialized "next-token" neurons in the MLP whose output weights tie them to predicting specific tokens. 
- Analyze if attention heads recognize contexts that activate these token-predicting neurons to help generate those tokens associated with that context.
- Develop a 5-step methodology involving:
   1) Identifying next-token neurons using output weight analysis
   2) Finding max-activating contexts for those neurons
   3) Quantifying attention head activations of the neurons using attribution analysis
   4) Generating explanations of differential head activity using GPT-4  
   5) Validating explanation quality by having GPT-4 classify new examples

Key Contributions
- Found attention heads that capture linguistic contexts relevant for predicting certain tokens, working together with downstream token-specialized neurons
- Proposed an automated analysis pipeline to characterize and explain attention-MLP interactions at scale
- Introduced metric called "head explanation score" to quantify usefulness of neural explanations for predicting behavior
- Demonstrated the approach works for smaller models and the Pythia model family
- Showed explanations avoid "interpretability illusion" by testing diverse prompts

In summary, the paper advances our understanding of how attention enables context-dependent processing in LLMs by directing information to specialized token-predicting neurons. The analysis framework also facilitates large-scale investigation of attention-neuron dynamics.
