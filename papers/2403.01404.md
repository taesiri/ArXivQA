# [What Is Missing in Multilingual Visual Reasoning and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper evaluates multilingual visual reasoning capabilities of both proprietary and open AI models on two datasets - English NLVR2 and multilingual multi-cultural MaRVL across 5 languages. It finds that the proprietary model GPT-4V significantly outperforms open models in zero-shot reasoning on this task. However, there are still gaps compared to human performance. 

Analysis of Model Failures:
The paper analyzes three key challenging aspects that models struggle with:
1) Multilinguality: Models perform worse on non-English languages compared to English.
2) Complex Reasoning: Performance decreases as reasoning complexity/statement length increases.
3) Multimodality: Models are pretrained on single image-text pairs but need to reason over image pairs.

Proposed Solutions:
To address the above challenges, the paper proposes three interventions:
1) Translate-Test: Translate non-English statements to English. Helps most models but hurts GPT-4V.
2) Visual Programming: Break down reasoning into modular programs executed on images. Adopts VisProg approach.
3) Reasoning with Captions: Generate captions conditioned on statements for each image, then reason over captions. 

Results:
The captioning intervention gives best improvements - boosts open model LLaVA's MaRVL accuracy by 13.4% to achieve SOTA for open models. Also minorly improves GPT-4V. Translation helps other open models.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluation and analysis of multilingual visual reasoning
- Showcases superior performance but also need for improvements in open models compared to GPT-4V
- Proposes interventions that give significant gains in open model performance on this challenging task


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates multilingual visual reasoning capabilities of proprietary and open models, analyzes where they fall short, and proposes interventions to address challenges related to multilinguality, reasoning complexity, and multimodality, achieving state-of-the-art performance for open models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Evaluating and comparing the multilingual visual reasoning capabilities of proprietary models like GPT-4V and open models like LLaVA, mBLIP, CCLM, etc. on datasets like NLVR2 and MaRVL. The key finding is that GPT-4V significantly outperforms open models.

2) Analyzing the key challenges that make multilingual visual reasoning difficult - multilinguality, complex reasoning, and multimodality. 

3) Proposing three targeted interventions to address these challenges:
(a) Translate-test to tackle multilinguality 
(b) Visual programming to break down complex reasoning
(c) Reasoning with image captions to alleviate multimodal interaction

4) Showing that the proposed interventions, especially reasoning with captions, can significantly boost the performance of open models like LLaVA to achieve new state-of-the-art results for open models on this task. The interventions also slightly improve GPT-4V.

In summary, the main contribution is a rigorous analysis of where models struggle on multilingual visual reasoning, paired with novel interventions that push forward the state-of-the-art for open models on this challenging and inclusive task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using image captioning to improve multimodal reasoning performance. What are the key advantages of using captions over directly reasoning on image pairs? How does this help address the challenges of multimodality, complex reasoning, and multilinguality?

2. When generating captions, the paper first generates targeted instructions based on the statement. How do these instructions ensure that the captions contain the necessary information for reasoning about the statement? What impact did this have on overall performance?

3. The paper experiments with different captioning models like InstructBLIP, PromptCap, GPT-4V, and LLaVA-13B. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these models for this task? Which one worked best and why?

4. For the final reasoning step, which language model was used? What prompted the authors to choose this particular model over other options? How does its chain-of-thought reasoning ability lend itself well to this task?

5. The paper finds that the captioning intervention significantly boosts LLaVA's performance on both NLVR2 and MaRVL. Can you analyze the impact on each dataset individually? What enabled it to generalize well from English to other languages?

6. How does the performance of the captioning pipeline compare to the visual programming intervention? What are the tradeoffs between the two methods in terms of accuracy, complexity, and applicability?

7. The authors find that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance for open models under zero-shot settings. But how does it compare to supervised approaches? Is further training needed to match or exceed the state-of-the-art?

8. For the translate-test intervention, why does GPT-4V exhibit degraded performance when using translated text while other models improve? What does this reveal about GPT-4V's multilingual capabilities?

9. The authors emphasize the value of having high-performing open models alongside proprietary ones like GPT-4V. In what ways can the methods here help continue advancing open models for inclusive and equitable language technology?

10. What limitations remain in the method? What kinds of reasoning tasks, languages, or cultural contexts may it still struggle with? How can future work build on these ideas to create even more general and robust multimodal reasoning?
