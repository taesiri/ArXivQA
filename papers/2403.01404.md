# [What Is Missing in Multilingual Visual Reasoning and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper evaluates multilingual visual reasoning capabilities of both proprietary and open AI models on two datasets - English NLVR2 and multilingual multi-cultural MaRVL across 5 languages. It finds that the proprietary model GPT-4V significantly outperforms open models in zero-shot reasoning on this task. However, there are still gaps compared to human performance. 

Analysis of Model Failures:
The paper analyzes three key challenging aspects that models struggle with:
1) Multilinguality: Models perform worse on non-English languages compared to English.
2) Complex Reasoning: Performance decreases as reasoning complexity/statement length increases.
3) Multimodality: Models are pretrained on single image-text pairs but need to reason over image pairs.

Proposed Solutions:
To address the above challenges, the paper proposes three interventions:
1) Translate-Test: Translate non-English statements to English. Helps most models but hurts GPT-4V.
2) Visual Programming: Break down reasoning into modular programs executed on images. Adopts VisProg approach.
3) Reasoning with Captions: Generate captions conditioned on statements for each image, then reason over captions. 

Results:
The captioning intervention gives best improvements - boosts open model LLaVA's MaRVL accuracy by 13.4% to achieve SOTA for open models. Also minorly improves GPT-4V. Translation helps other open models.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluation and analysis of multilingual visual reasoning
- Showcases superior performance but also need for improvements in open models compared to GPT-4V
- Proposes interventions that give significant gains in open model performance on this challenging task
