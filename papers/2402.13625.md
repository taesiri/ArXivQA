# [MORE: Multi-mOdal REtrieval Augmented Generative Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Commonsense knowledge is inherently difficult for language models (LMs) to learn sufficiently from just modeling text generation due to the reporting bias, i.e. commonsense is significantly less frequently recorded than its existence. 
- Although retrieving text snippets as supplementary information has been shown effective to enhance LMs' commonsense ability, little effort has been made to effectively utilize images, which also contain commonsense knowledge inherently.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel Multi-mOdal REtrieval (MORE) augmentation framework to leverage both text and images to enhance LMs' commonsense ability.
- MORE consists of four components: 
   1) A retriever to retrieve relevant text snippets and images based on the input concept words.
   2) An encoder to represent the multimodal retrieved results.
   3) An integrator to extract and condense useful information from the encoded representations into a fixed-length prompt.
   4) The LM backbone to generate text based on the retrieval-augmented prompt and input concepts.
- Two challenges are addressed: 1) Enable LMs to effectively extract knowledge from multimodal retrieved results; 2) Ensure LMs do not ignore or blindly trust the retrieved results.
- Solutions: Adopt a cross-attention based integrator; Introduce query dropout and noisy retrieval input during training.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel framework that incorporates both text and images as retrieval augmentation to enhance commonsense reasoning ability of LMs.
- Demonstrate efficacy of MORE in significantly improving performance of both single modal and multimodal LMs on the generative commonsense reasoning task CommonGen.
- Outperform representative retrieval augmentation baselines and large LMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. 
- Provide comprehensive analysis and case studies to validate the rationality and effectiveness of MORE.
