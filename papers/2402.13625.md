# [MORE: Multi-mOdal REtrieval Augmented Generative Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Commonsense knowledge is inherently difficult for language models (LMs) to learn sufficiently from just modeling text generation due to the reporting bias, i.e. commonsense is significantly less frequently recorded than its existence. 
- Although retrieving text snippets as supplementary information has been shown effective to enhance LMs' commonsense ability, little effort has been made to effectively utilize images, which also contain commonsense knowledge inherently.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel Multi-mOdal REtrieval (MORE) augmentation framework to leverage both text and images to enhance LMs' commonsense ability.
- MORE consists of four components: 
   1) A retriever to retrieve relevant text snippets and images based on the input concept words.
   2) An encoder to represent the multimodal retrieved results.
   3) An integrator to extract and condense useful information from the encoded representations into a fixed-length prompt.
   4) The LM backbone to generate text based on the retrieval-augmented prompt and input concepts.
- Two challenges are addressed: 1) Enable LMs to effectively extract knowledge from multimodal retrieved results; 2) Ensure LMs do not ignore or blindly trust the retrieved results.
- Solutions: Adopt a cross-attention based integrator; Introduce query dropout and noisy retrieval input during training.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel framework that incorporates both text and images as retrieval augmentation to enhance commonsense reasoning ability of LMs.
- Demonstrate efficacy of MORE in significantly improving performance of both single modal and multimodal LMs on the generative commonsense reasoning task CommonGen.
- Outperform representative retrieval augmentation baselines and large LMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. 
- Provide comprehensive analysis and case studies to validate the rationality and effectiveness of MORE.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MORE, a novel multi-modal retrieval augmentation framework that leverages retrieved images and text to enhance the commonsense reasoning ability of language models for text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing MORE, a novel multi-modal retrieval augmented language modeling framework to enhance the commonsense reasoning ability of language models by leveraging both text and images as supplementary information. 

2) Introducing effective components in MORE including a multi-modal encoder, an integrator to extract useful information from retrieval results, and training strategies like query dropout and noisy retrieval input to ensure effective utilization of retrieval results.

3) Conducting extensive experiments on the CommonGen task to demonstrate MORE's ability to significantly improve both single modal and multi-modal pre-trained language models. MORE also outperforms representative retrieval augmentation baselines and large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

4) Providing comprehensive analysis and case studies to illustrate the advantages of MORE and how the supplementary multi-modal information helps language models generate more reasonable sentences.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective framework MORE that incorporates multi-modal retrieval to enhance language models' commonsense reasoning ability, along with extensive verification of its efficacy.

The paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval augmentation framework called MORE to enhance the commonsense reasoning and text generation capabilities of language models. It leverages both text snippets and images retrieved based on the input text to provide additional context and knowledge to guide the language models. Key components include a cross-attention based integrator to extract useful information from the multi-modal retrieval results, query dropout during training to force better utilization of the retrieval, and mechanisms to make the model robust to noisy retrieval. Evaluations are done on the CommonGen generative commonsense reasoning dataset. Overall, the main focus is on improving commonsense reasoning for text generation through multi-modal retrieval augmentation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval framework called MORE to augment language models. Can you explain in detail how the retrieval, encoding, integration, and generation components of MORE work together to enable better text generation? 

2. The paper highlights two major challenges when incorporating multi-modal retrieval results into language models. What are those two challenges and how does MORE attempt to address them?

3. The query concept dropout and noisy retrieval augmented input are two key training strategies proposed in MORE. Can you analyze the motivation and effectiveness of these two strategies? 

4. How does MORE handle variable quality and relevance of the retrieved images and texts to avoid blindly trusting the augmentation inputs? What experiments and analyses were done to demonstrate this capability?

5. What advantages does directly using raw images for augmentation have over first generating image captions as done in prior work? Provide both quantitative results and qualitative examples to support your explanation.  

6. How does the performance of MORE vary with different numbers of retrieved images and texts used for augmentation? What is the optimal configuration and why?

7. Compare and contrast the architectures of the text-based vs multi-modal language models tested with MORE. How does MORE showing consistent benefits across them demonstrate its wide applicability?

8. What experiments were done to validate that MORE's improvements do not simply arise from the additional parameters introduced? Analyze these ablation studies in detail. 

9. Provide some example cases where incorrect or nonsensical generations from language models are corrected by MORE's retrieval augmentation. Explain the role played by the images and texts.

10. What are some promising future directions for improving upon MORE's capability for multi-modal retrieval augmentation of language models?
