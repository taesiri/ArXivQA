# [Tune-A-Video: One-Shot Tuning of Image Diffusion Models for
  Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11565)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can text-to-image (T2I) generative models pretrained on large image datasets be adapted to generate novel text-to-video (T2V) content from a single example video and text prompt?

The key hypothesis is that by fine-tuning the pretrained T2I models with sparse spatio-temporal attention and efficient tuning strategies, they can effectively learn to generate new videos that match edited text prompts while preserving temporal consistency from the example video. 

In essence, the paper is exploring whether the knowledge already learned by powerful T2I models like stable diffusion can be leveraged to enable one-shot video generation from text, eliminating the need to train expensive T2V models from scratch on large video datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Introducing a new setting called "One-Shot Video Tuning" for text-to-video generation, which involves training a T2V generator using only a single text-video pair and pre-trained T2I models. This eliminates the need for training on large-scale video datasets.

- Proposing Tune-A-Video, a framework for text-driven video generation and editing using pre-trained T2I diffusion models. The key components are:

1) Efficient spatio-temporal attention mechanism that models temporal consistency.

2) Tuning strategy that updates only the projection matrices in attention blocks to retain knowledge from pre-trained T2I models. 

3) Inference technique involving DDIM inversion of input video to provide structure guidance for temporally coherent sampling.

- Demonstrating the capability of Tune-A-Video for various applications like object editing, background changes, and style transfer using only a single text-video pair.

- Extensive experiments comparing against state-of-the-art baselines, ablations, and applications across diverse scenarios to highlight the efficacy of the proposed method.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the One-Shot Video Tuning setting and Tune-A-Video framework that can generate and edit videos from a single example, without needing large-scale training. The method is simple yet effective for text-driven video manipulation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Tune-A-Video, a new method for text-to-video generation that can produce novel videos from a single text-video pair by efficiently tuning pretrained text-to-image diffusion models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in text-to-video generation:

- This paper introduces a new setting called "one-shot video tuning" where only a single text-video pair is used to train a text-to-video generator. This is different from most prior work like Make-A-Video, Imagen Video, etc. that require large-scale text-video datasets for training. The one-shot setting makes text-to-video generation more accessible.

- The proposed method builds on top of pre-trained text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion. This allows it to leverage immense amounts of image data that text-to-video models trained from scratch do not have access to. This is a key advantage over methods like CogVideo that train text-to-video models from scratch.

- The model employs sparse spatio-temporal attention and inversion guidance to generate smooth and coherent videos. Other recent video generation works use similar techniques, but this paper shows how to effectively adapt them in the one-shot setting with pre-trained generators.

- Results are very strong considering only a single text-video example is used, and the method enables several creative applications like object/background editing, style transfer, etc. Qualitatively the results look better than CogVideo and more consistent than frame-wise editing methods like Plug-and-Play.

- The approach is not as controllable as methods that rely on large-scale supervised data, but the one-shot setting provides more flexibility. The method is also compatible with personalized models like DreamBooth for more control.

Overall, this paper introduces a practical new setting for text-to-video generation using available pre-trained models, and demonstrates compelling results on this challenging task through efficient tuning strategies. The one-shot approach is an exciting direction that increases the accessibility of text-to-video generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the ability to handle multiple objects and object interactions. The authors note a limitation of their method is that it can produce undesirable results when the input video contains multiple interacting objects. They suggest using additional conditional information like depth maps to help the model differentiate between objects.

- Incorporating motion priors and trajectory modeling. The authors discuss potentially incorporating motion priors or explicit trajectory modeling to further improve the coherence and naturalness of motions in the generated videos.

- Exploring new prompt editing applications. The authors propose their method could enable novel video editing abilities through creative text prompt editing, such as editing the sequence of actions or adding/removing characters. More exploration could be done here.

- Training the full model end-to-end. Currently, the authors pretrain the text-to-image model and then finetune it on the video task. Training the full model end-to-end on both modalities could be investigated.

- Extending to longer video generation. The authors generate up to 32-frame videos in their experiments. Scaling up to synthesize much longer videos is an important direction.

- Integrating other modalities. The current model conditions solely on text prompts. Incorporating other input modalities like audio or user sketches could enable new applications.

In summary, the main future directions are improving multi-object modeling, integrating stronger motion and trajectory priors, exploring new video editing applications, end-to-end training, longer video generation, and conditioning on diverse modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Tune-A-Video, a new method for text-to-video generation that requires only a single text-video pair and leverages pretrained text-to-image models. The key idea is to take advantage of the ability of text-to-image models to generate still images representing verbs and extend them to the temporal domain by generating multiple frames concurrently. The proposed model employs a tailored sparse spatio-temporal attention mechanism and an efficient one-shot tuning strategy to learn continuous motion from the input video. At inference time, denoising diffusion model inversion is used to provide structure guidance for temporally coherent sampling. The method is shown to enable a variety of text-driven video generation and editing applications including object editing, background changes, and style transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach's ability to produce high-quality, temporally consistent videos that accurately reflect edited text prompts using just a single video example, outperforming existing text-to-video and video editing baselines.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Tune-A-Video, a new method for text-to-video generation that requires only a single text-video pair as input. The key idea is to leverage pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and efficiently tune them for video generation. The method makes two key observations about text-to-image models - first, they can generate static images representing verb terms, indicating an ability to model motion. Second, extending their spatial attention to temporal attention produces consistent objects across frames. 

Based on these observations, Tune-A-Video inflates a text-to-image model to the spatio-temporal domain and tunes it on a single input video. To improve temporal consistency, sparse causal attention is used to reduce computation while maintaining object consistency. Structural guidance from the input video is provided through latent space inversion. Experiments demonstrate Tune-A-Video's ability to generate novel videos representing text edits, with consistent objects and smooth motions. Comparisons to recent text-to-video methods show superior coherence and alignment to text. Overall, the work presents an efficient alternative to training on large video datasets, enabling controllable video generation from a single example.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new framework called Tune-A-Video for text-to-video generation using only a single text-video pair as input. The key idea is to leverage pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and efficiently adapt them for text-to-video generation. 

Specifically, the method makes two key observations on pretrained T2I models: 1) they can generate static images representing verb terms, 2) extending their spatial self-attention to spatio-temporal domain surprisingly maintains content consistency across frames. Based on these, the proposed Tune-A-Video method inflates a 2D T2I model to 3D by using pseudo 3D convolutions and adding a sparse spatio-temporal attention mechanism. During training, only the query projections in attention blocks are updated via diffusion model fine-tuning on the input video. During inference, structure guidance from the input video is incorporated through latent space inversion, and novel videos are sampled via DDIM conditioned on edited text prompts. This allows generating temporally coherent videos with smooth motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tune-A-Video's ability for controllable video generation and editing using just a single example video.
