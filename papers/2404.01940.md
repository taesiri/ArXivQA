# [Towards Better Understanding of Cybercrime: The Role of Fine-Tuned LLMs   in Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Translating Russian-language cybercrime communications like hacktivist chat messages into English is challenging but important for cybersecurity defense. 
- Human translation is slow, expensive, scarce, inconsistent, and exposes people to disturbing content.  
- Machine translation like Google Translate struggles with nuances like slang, humor, and cyber jargon.

Solution:
- Collect and manually translate a dataset of chat messages from a Russian hacktivist Telegram channel.
- Compare translations from 8 machine translation models including Google Translate and GPT-3.
- Select the best model (GPT-3.5) and fine-tune it with the curated dataset to better handle nuances.
- Evaluate fine-tuned model against base model and human translators on unseen test data.

Results:
- Fine-tuned model preferred by human evaluators 64% over 36% for base GPT-3.5.
- Fine-tuned model faster, cheaper (430-23,000x less than human), more consistent than human translation.  
- Handles nuances like slang, URLs, emoji better than Google Translate.
- Enables cheaper, scalable, timely analysis of hacktivist communications.

Main Contributions:
- Curated Russian-English hacktivist chat translation dataset
- Methodology for fine-tuning LLMs to translate cybercrime text
- Analysis showing fine-tuned LLM advantages over other methods
- Open-source tools for collecting and translating hacktivist messages

The paper demonstrates that proper fine-tuning allows LLMs to overcome limitations of traditional machine translation and human translation for analyzing underground cybercrime communications.
