# [CoMo: Controllable Motion Generation through Language Guided Pose Code   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing text-to-motion models lack fine-grained control over the motion generation process. They struggle to modify subtle postures within a motion or insert new actions at specific moments. This limits their applicability in diverse scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CoMo, a Controllable Motion generation model that can accurately generate and edit motions by leveraging large language models (LLMs). CoMo has three key components:

1. Motion Encoder-Decoder: It decomposes motions into discrete, semantically meaningful "pose codes", with each code encapsulating the state of a body part (e.g. "left knee slightly bent"). A decoder maps the codes back into full motions. 

2. Motion Generator: A transformer model that takes a text description and generates pose codes autoregressively. It also uses an LLM to produce fine-grained body part keywords to enhance text-to-motion consistency.

3. Motion Editor: Uses an LLM to directly modify the pose codes based on natural language editing instructions, ensuring motion consistency.

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes interpretable pose code representation that factorizes motions across space and time. Enables intuitive and fine-grained control.

2. Presented a transformer architecture to generate pose codes conditioned on high-level text and fine-grained LLM-generated keywords. Achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion generation.  

3. Demonstrated the capability to leverage pose codes for LLM-based zero-shot motion editing. Outperforms previous works in human studies. Enables interactive editing.

The proposed CoMo framework enables controlling subtle aspects of motions using natural language by mapping text to an intermediate interpretable pose code representation. Evaluations showed competitive generation performance and superior editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
