# [Towards Non-Adversarial Algorithmic Recourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Non-Adversarial Algorithmic Recourse":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of distinguishing between adversarial examples and counterfactual explanations in algorithmic recourse. It argues that in high-stakes decision scenarios with human experts in the loop, counterfactuals should not only change the model's prediction but also the true label (called "non-adversarial recourse"). This is a critical real-world requirement lacking connection in prior conceptual work trying to disentangle counterfactuals and adversarials.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formally defines non-adversarial algorithmic recourse and studies how different factors like the ML model, cost function, and optimization routine practically impact its realization. Through a theoretical analysis, the paper shows how feature relevance estimates can be used to derive optimal cost functions that encourage non-adversarial directions of change.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduction of a novel recourse problem with human experts in the loop that require non-adversarial recourse in line with regulations like GDPR.
2) Formal definition and promotion of non-adversarial algorithmic recourse - counterfactuals that change both the model's prediction and the true label.
3) Theoretical analysis of how task-relevant features can be identified and leveraged to compute recourse costs that foster non-adversarial directions of change.
4) An empirical study across datasets and methods that finds the choice of an accurate and robust ML model to be more critical than the cost function or optimization routine for non-adversarial recourse generation.
5) Valuable practical insights into components that can steer counterfactual search procedures towards non-adversarial recourse critical for real-world deployment.

In summary, the paper introduces the concept of non-adversarial algorithmic recourse, studies what influences its realization in practice, and provides valuable insights into achieving counterfactuals that change the ground truth. This lays an important foundation for developing reliable recourse methods suited for real-world decision systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of non-adversarial algorithmic recourse, which refers to counterfactual explanations that change both the model's prediction and the true label, as opposed to adversarial examples which only change the model's prediction while being misclassified relative to the ground truth; the paper argues such recourse is needed in realistic decision-making scenarios with human oversight and empirically analyzes different factors like model accuracy versus cost functions that determine whether recourse exhibits adversarial properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of a novel recourse problem that addresses real-world decision systems where human experts play a pivotal role in making case-based decisions, while also considering input from a machine learning model. 

2. Proposing non-adversarial algorithmic recourse as a solution to the realistic recourse problem. This aligns the academic discourse on distinguishing adversarial examples from counterfactual explanations with practical decision-making.

3. Promoting non-adversarial recourse theoretically by deriving optimal cost functions that encourage less "adversarial" recourse. The analysis shows how feature attributions can identify task-relevant features.

4. Empirical insights on several key components practitioners can manipulate to foster non-adversarial algorithmic recourse, including improving the robustness and accuracy of the machine learning model. The paper finds that changes in the model are often more significant than the choice of cost function for reducing adversarialness.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the concept of non-adversarial algorithmic recourse for realistic decision systems involving both machine learning models and human experts, and providing guidance on how to implement it in practice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Counterfactual explanations - Explanations that aim to show how an input would need to be changed to produce a different, more desirable output from a model.

- Adversarial examples - Inputs to a model that are intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake, while being perceptually similar to correctly handled inputs. 

- Non-adversarial algorithmic recourse - A specific type of counterfactual explanation that not only flips the model's prediction, but also aligns with the true label or decision that would be made in the real-world scenario.

- High-stakes decision scenarios - Settings like loan application decisions where counterfactuals need to produce outcomes that match real expert decisions, not just trick the model.

- Cost functions - Functions used to constrain counterfactual search and determine how close edits are to the original input. The choice impacts adversarialness.

- Machine learning models - More accurate and robust models are shown to produce less adversarial counterfactual explanations.

So in summary, key terms revolve around counterfactuals, adversarials, their differences, ensuring counterfactuals match real decisions, and factors like models and costs that impact getting non-adversarial recourse.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "non-adversarial algorithmic recourse." How is this concept defined and how does it differ from standard counterfactual explanations or adversarial examples? What are the key properties that distinguish it?

2. The paper argues that in many real-world scenarios, decisions are made by human experts who may override or recalibrate the predictions from a machine learning model. How does this impact the notion of counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples? Why does this make generating reliable recourse more challenging?

3. The paper theoretically analyzes different factors that could potentially make recourse less adversarial, including the machine learning model, the distance function, and the optimization routine. Which factor or factors does the empirical analysis suggest have the most significant impact? Why? 

4. How does the paper formally model the role of human experts in the decision-making pipeline? What assumptions are made about the ground truth labels provided by the experts? How are these used to evaluate whether recourse examples are non-adversarial?

5. The paper derives optimal cost functions for linear models that aim to maximize the use of discriminative features when generating recourse. How are these cost functions derived? What do the different norms try to achieve in weighting features differently?

6. Across different datasets, what general trends does the paper find regarding the ability of standard adversarial attack methods to generate non-adversarial recourse? How do they compare to specialized counterfactual explanation methods?

7. What implications does the concept of non-adversarial recourse have on strategies like improving model robustness or requiring counterfactuals to remain in-distribution? Could these be interpreted as ways to make recourse less adversarial?

8. How exactly does the paper evaluate the “adversarialness” of different recourse methods? What metrics are used to quantify the number of retries needed to change the presumed ground truth?

9. What overall conclusions or insights does the paper provide regarding reliable strategies to generate counterfactual explanations that avoid adversarial properties? Which factors seem most or least important empirically?

10. How might the notion of non-adversarial recourse change for more complex modalities like images or text? Would the relative importance of factors like model accuracy or distance functions change significantly?
