# [Agent-Aware Training for Agent-Agnostic Action Advising in Deep   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16807)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Agent-Aware Training yet Agent-Agnostic Action Advising (A7) to address the sampling inefficiency problem in deep reinforcement learning. A7 combines the strengths of both agent-specific and agent-agnostic action advising methods for determining when to request expert guidance. It employs contrastive learning through an action-BYOL model to extract robust and discriminative state features. The similarity of these features is then used as an indicator to decide if advice should be solicited in a given state, making the process agent-agnostic. Additionally, a behavior cloning-based reuse model provides pseudo-advice, and intrinsic rewards further incentivize exploitation of the guidance. Experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that A7 significantly accelerates agent training and outperforms existing approaches. Key innovations include the proxy feature extractor for similarity-based advice evaluation and the reuse model paired with intrinsic rewards for enhanced utilization of the limited teacher budget. Overall, A7 offers an effective solution to improve sampling efficiency in reinforcement learning through prudent integration of external guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework called A7 that combines agent-aware training and agent-agnostic action advising to effectively leverage limited expert guidance and accelerate agent learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called "Agent-Aware trAining yet Agent-Agnostic Action Advising" (A7) for action advising in deep reinforcement learning. The key ideas and contributions include:

1) A7 strikes a balance between agent-specific and agent-agnostic action advising methods. It utilizes state feature similarity for determining when to seek action advice, where the features are extracted by a proxy model trained in a self-supervised, agent-aware manner. But the similarity calculation for advice seeking is agent-agnostic. 

2) A7 introduces an action-BYOL method to train the proxy feature extractor. This contrasts the current state representation with the representation of the subsequent state reached after taking the agent's action. The loss aims to make these representations similar.

3) The paper proposes an intrinsic reward generator to encourage exploitation of the obtained advice. This includes training a behavior cloning model on state-action pairs from the teacher and assigning intrinsic rewards to states where this model's advice is reused.

4) Experiments across a range of environments demonstrate that A7 accelerates learning and achieves better final performance compared to prior agent-specific and agent-agnostic techniques. Ablations verify the individual benefits of the main components of A7.

In summary, the key contribution is the overall A7 framework and specific techniques to balance agent-aware feature learning with agent-agnostic similarity-based action advising in an effective manner.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Action advising - The framework of seeking expert action guidance to improve reinforcement learning agents.

- Sampling inefficiency - The problem in deep reinforcement learning where agents require many environment interactions to learn good policies. 

- Agent-specific methods - Action advising approaches that rely on the agent's uncertainty to determine when to request advice.

- Agent-agnostic methods - Action advising approaches that evaluate the novelty of a state to decide when to seek advice, irrespective of the agent policy.

- Contrastive learning - A self-supervised representation learning approach that trains models by contrasting augmented views of the same data sample.

- Action-BYOL - A contrastive learning method proposed in the paper that utilizes consecutive states and actions experienced by the agent for representation learning.

- Intrinsic rewards - Additional rewards provided to the agent for reuse advice samples to incentivize exploiting teacher guidance.

- Behavior cloning - Supervised learning to imitate expert actions, used in the paper to train a reuse model.

In summary, the key themes of the paper revolve around action advising, contrastive representation learning, and improving sampling efficiency in reinforcement learning.
