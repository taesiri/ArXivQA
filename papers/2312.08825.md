# [Guided Diffusion from Self-Supervised Diffusion Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08825)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework to enable diffusion models to leverage their own inherent discriminative capabilities as a guidance signal, eliminating the need for external annotation or self-supervised models. Specifically, they introduce an online optimal transport-based clustering algorithm that assigns images to learnable prototypes during training, allowing the model to cultivate its own conditional generative process. This self-guidance through bootstrap learning is shown to surpass unconditional diffusion and approach the performance of class-conditioned models on ImageNet and LSUN datasets. Additionally, by formulating the diffusion process as an ODE rather than traditionally used SDEs, they are able to strike an improved balance between sampling efficiency and fidelity. The proposed online self-guidance framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming related baseline comparisons on high-resolution image datasets. Key benefits include eliminating data annotations, enabling flexible semantic control, and achieving state-of-the-art sampling quality. Through online optimal transport assignment and innovations in diffusion modeling, this work opens promising research directions in self-supervised conditional generation.
