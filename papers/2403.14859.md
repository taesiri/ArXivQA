# [Comparing Plausibility Estimates in Base and Instruction-Tuned Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14859)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into everyday applications, it's important to reliably assess their capabilities, including their general world knowledge. One way to evaluate this is through sentence plausibility judgments. 
- Recently, instruction-tuned LLMs that can be explicitly queried via prompts have become popular. However, it's unclear if prompting actually provides a better estimate of an LLM's internal knowledge compared to implicit measures like log-likelihoods.

Methods:
- The authors test LLM plausibility judgments using both log-likelihood scores and various prompting strategies across two experiments:
    - Experiment 1 evaluates judgments of single sentence event plausibility across 3 LLM families, comparing base vs instruct versions.
    - Experiment 2 looks at context-dependent plausibility judgments using a dataset of human plausibility ratings.

Key Findings:  
- Log-likelihoods are a more reliable indicator of plausibility than prompting approaches which can underestimate model knowledge.
- Instruction-tuning actually worsens log-likelihood alignment with human judgments relative to base versions. 
- Target word log-likelihoods effectively capture human contextual plausibility patterns, but global sentence scores are less modulated.
- No single prompting strategy reliably extracts plausibility knowledge across models.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive comparison of implicit (log-likelihood) vs explicit (prompting) plausibility evaluation.
- Demonstrates limitations of prompt-based methods for reliability and consistency.
- Shows that instruction-tuning, while useful for alignment in some areas, does not improve behavioral-level alignment with human plausibility judgments.
- Establishes log-likelihoods as a strong baseline for estimating sentence plausibility in LLMs.

In summary, the paper clearly highlights the continued utility of log-likelihoods for probing LLM knowledge, the difficulties of prompt evaluation, and that instruction-tuning has tradeoffs depending on the capability being assessed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares implicit (log likelihood scores) and explicit (prompting) plausibility judgments in base and instruction-tuned language models, finding that log likelihoods are a more reliable metric that generally outperforms prompting, though still falls short of human performance, and that instruction tuning often worsens log likelihood alignment with human judgments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive study comparing different methods for evaluating semantic plausibility in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper compares:

1) Explicit prompting methods where LLMs are directly queried about the plausibility of sentences via natural language prompts.

2) Implicit methods that examine the log likelihood scores LLMs assign to plausible versus implausible sentences. 

3) Performance of base LLMs versus LLMs that have been instruction-tuned.

4) Plausibility judgments for isolated sentences versus sentences presented with licensing/non-licensing context. 

The key findings are:

(1) Log likelihood scores are a more reliable indicator of an LLM's internal assessment of plausibility compared to prompting approaches. 

(2) Instruction-tuning often makes log likelihood scores align worse with human judgments. 

(3) Log likelihoods can effectively model contextual effects on plausibility judgments and replicate patterns found in human data.

Overall, the paper shows log likelihoods remain the best current estimate of LLM plausibility knowledge, outperforming prompting methods. The paper also characterizes strengths and limitations of different LLMs in modeling plausibility.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Plausibility estimates
- Log likelihood (LL) scores 
- Prompting
- Instruction tuning
- Event knowledge
- Sentence plausibility
- Contextual plausibility
- Minimal sentence pairs
- Human plausibility judgments

The paper compares different methods for evaluating plausibility estimates in large language models, including log likelihood scores and prompting queries. It looks at plausibility for both single sentences and sentences in context. The paper also examines the impact of instruction tuning on the alignment of LLM plausibility estimates with human judgments. Key findings show log likelihood scores are more reliable than prompting for assessing plausibility, and that instruction tuning can negatively impact alignment with humans.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares explicit (prompt-based) and implicit (log likelihood score based) plausibility judgments. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach? Under what conditions might one be preferred over the other?

2. The paper finds that log likelihood scores are a more reliable indicator of plausibility knowledge than prompt-based approaches. Why might this be the case? What factors could contribute to the poorer performance of prompting?

3. The paper shows that instruction tuning often worsens log likelihood score alignment with human plausibility judgments. Why might instruction tuning have this detrimental effect? What modifications could be made to instruction tuning procedures to improve alignment? 

4. The paper demonstrates context effects on plausibility judgments using a dataset from language neuroscience. What are some other rich datasets from psychology/neuroscience that could be leveraged to further probe contextual effects?

5. The target word log likelihoods showed better context sensitivity than sentence log likelihoods in Experiment 2. What mechanisms might account for this discrepancy? How could models be improved to better propagate context effects?  

6. While log likelihoods capture substantial plausibility knowledge, model performance still falls short of humans. What interventions could help close this gap? Are there fundamental constraints on what can be learned from language model pretraining alone?

7. The paper focuses on English language models and datasets. How well might we expect the conclusions to generalize to other languages? What properties of a language might impact results?

8. The prompting setup differs in key ways from how humans encounter these tasks (e.g. lack of broader experimental context). How could prompting scenarios be made more naturalistic? Would this impact conclusions?

9. The model scale (up to 7B parameters) is far below the state-of-the-art in 2023. How might performance evolve with model scale? Would qualitative conclusions hold?

10. The paper highlights the difficulty of reliably extracting knowledge via prompting. What innovations could make prompting more robust? Can we characterize the situations when prompting does/doesn't work?
