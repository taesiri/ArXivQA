## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Dense 3D reconstruction of urban driving scenes is challenging due to issues like odometry errors, presence of dynamic objects, and fine structural details. 
- Traditional methods using LiDAR point clouds or structure from motion on images have limitations in terms of sparsity, noise or difficulty in scaling.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a framework combining neural implicit surfaces and radiance fields for multimodal 3D reconstruction.
- Decompose scene into foreground (road, buildings etc.) and background (sky, landscapes), and fit separate models.  
- Foreground model predicts signed distance field and view-dependent color using neural network.
- Filter dynamic objects on-the-fly during sampling using 3D detection models.
- Apply "divide and conquer" for large scale scenes by dividing into subsequences.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate high quality 3D reconstruction of urban driving scenes using proposed framework.
- Show improved quantitative results by incorporating LiDAR data along with camera images.
- Successfully filter movable objects like vehicles using 3D detections.
- Show ability to scale to large environments by training on divided subsequences.
- Various applications like automated annotation, data augmentation and benchmarking.

In summary, the paper presents a novel neural rendering based approach for multimodal urban scene 3D reconstruction that is dense, accurate, handles dynamic objects and scales to large environments. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the robustness of the proposed methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for large-scale urban scene reconstruction by combining neural radiance fields and neural implicit surfaces, leveraging LiDAR and camera data, filtering dynamic objects using 3D detections, and enabling scalability through a divide-and-conquer approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a method for dense 3D reconstruction of urban driving scenes using a framework that combines neural implicit surfaces and radiance fields. Specifically:

- They propose a scene decomposition into foreground (street scene) and background (sky, landscapes), with separate neural rendering models fitted to each. 

- They utilize 3D object detections to filter out dynamic objects on the fly during neural rendering. This allows reconstructing only the static scene elements.

- They demonstrate how incorporating LiDAR measurements during training leads to more detailed and accurate geometry reconstruction compared to using only monocular depth estimation.

- They introduce a "divide and conquer" approach to scale the reconstruction to large driving sequences by dividing them into smaller subsequences and merging the results.

In summary, the key contribution is a full pipeline for implicit neural reconstruction of static elements in complex urban driving video, which can handle large sequences, leverage multiple modalities, and filter movable objects. The method is shown to reconstruct geometry and appearance with high quality.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions decomposing the scene into foreground and background models. What are the key differences in the network architectures and loss functions used for the foreground and background models? What motivated this design choice?

2. Dynamic object filtering is performed using 3D object detection models. What specific signals from the detection models are used to determine if an object is dynamic or not? Why is pose refinement better posed without dynamic objects?

3. The method converts predicted signed distance values to density values using a Laplace distribution CDF. What is the intuition behind using a Laplace distribution here versus a Gaussian or other distribution? How do the parameters α and β affect the converted density values?

4. For supervision, geometric loss is calculated by projecting LiDAR points onto the camera frame. What are some challenges or sources of noise that could occur during this projection process? How could the system be made more robust to such issues?

5. The large-scale support is achieved using a "divide and conquer" approach on the input sequence. What determined the size of each subsequence? What would happen if the subsequences had too much or too little overlap spatially?

6. The paper mentions extracting a mesh from the implicit surface. What algorithm is used for mesh extraction and what post-processing such as occlusion culling is applied? What quality metrics are used to evaluate the reconstructed mesh?

7. What changes would be needed to adapt the model to handle video input instead of discrete frames? What consistency losses could be added to enforce temporal smoothness?

8. How does the hash encoding used in Instant-NGP provide memory and speed benefits over a standard MLP architecture like the original NeRF model? What hyperparameters control the capacity?

9. The method relies on offline 3D object detection models. How difficult would it be to update the dynamic object filtering online based on a streaming detection model? What challenges need to be addressed?

10. What ideas from other recent works could be incorporated to help address remaining artifacts issues such as shadows from dynamic objects or surface noise from sparse LiDAR supervision?
