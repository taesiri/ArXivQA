## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm for resource allocation that bridges diffusion models and edge computing systems while considering quality of service. Specifically, the algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between offloading decisions for computational tasks and the utility or effectiveness of AI-generated content (AIGC) diffusion models. It accounts for factors like average error rate, computation time, and energy consumption. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization, then converted into a tractable form using successive convex approximation techniques. The solution entails analyzing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to obtain optimal reverse diffusion steps and offloading decisions. Experiments demonstrate the algorithm enhances system efficiency. Overall, the paper pioneers an implementation for resource allocation of diffusion models in edge computing that ensures quality of AIGC while balancing latency and energy limitations of mobile devices.
