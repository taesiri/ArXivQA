This paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm for resource allocation that bridges diffusion models and edge computing systems while considering quality of service. Specifically, the algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between offloading decisions for computational tasks and the utility or effectiveness of AI-generated content (AIGC) diffusion models. It accounts for factors like average error rate, computation time, and energy consumption. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization, then converted into a tractable form using successive convex approximation techniques. The solution entails analyzing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to obtain optimal reverse diffusion steps and offloading decisions. Experiments demonstrate the algorithm enhances system efficiency.

Problem:
- AI-generated content (AIGC) services, such as text-to-image and image-to-image generation using diffusion models, are gaining popularity. However, deploying large AIGC models on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm to determine the offloading decisions and the number of reverse diffusion steps for each mobile user's computational task. 
- The objective is to minimize a weighted sum of: (1) computation time, (2) average error rate of results (for quality), and (3) energy consumption, while maximizing the utility gained from the reverse diffusion steps.

Key Contributions:
- Converts the integer programming problem into a tractable form using continuous relaxation techniques like successive convex approximation.

- Jointly optimizes the tradeoff between offloading decisions, number of diffusion steps, computation time, result quality, energy consumption and utility. 
- Experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in enhancing system efficiency compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper pioneers an algorithm for resource allocation in diffusion model-based AIGC services hosted on edge computing systems, while considering various factors like latency, quality, energy use and utility. The joint optimization technique outperforms baselines, making AIGC on edge devices more efficient.
