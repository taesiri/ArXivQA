# [Leveraging SE(3) Equivariance for Learning 3D Geometric Shape Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06810)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we leverage SE(3) equivariance to learn 3D geometric shape assembly from fractured parts?Specifically, the paper proposes to use SE(3)-equivariant representations to disentangle the shape and pose of fractured parts, in order to better predict how to assemble the parts into a complete 3D shape. This allows the model to focus on the geometric properties of the parts rather than being confused by arbitrary poses. The key ideas and contributions are:- Using SE(3)-equivariant networks to extract equivariant and invariant features for each individual part. This provides consistency and stability in the representations.- Introducing a correlation module to compute correlations between the equivariant features of a part and invariant features of other parts. This allows incorporating information about part relationships while maintaining equivariance. - Leveraging both equivariant and invariant features to obtain part representations that are equivariant to the part's pose but invariant to other parts' poses.- Applying the approach to both two-part geometric mating and multi-part assembly datasets and showing improved performance over baselines.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that SE(3) equivariance can help disentangle shape and pose for better 3D geometric shape assembly, especially when using correlations between equivariant/invariant features of multiple parts. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose to leverage SE(3) equivariance that disentangles shapes and poses of fractured parts for geometric shape assembly. 2. They utilize both SE(3)-equivariant and -invariant representations to learn SE(3)-equivariant part representations with part correlations for multi-part assembly.3. They demonstrate the effectiveness of SE(3) equivariance and their proposed method through experiments on representative benchmarks for both two-part and multi-part 3D geometric shape assembly.In summary, the key ideas are using SE(3) equivariance to disentangle shape and pose for geometric shape assembly, and extending this idea to learn part representations considering correlations between multiple parts. Experiments show this approach works better than methods without SE(3)-equivariant representations on geometric shape assembly tasks.
