# [Extreme Parkour with Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14341)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning approach can enable low-cost quadruped robots with imprecise actuation and sensing to perform extreme parkour behaviors directly from raw sensor inputs, without relying on explicit mapping or motion planning. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that a single neural network policy operating on depth images from an egocentric camera can produce precise control for challenging parkour skills like long jumps, high jumps, and walking on two legs.The key research questions addressed are:1) Can a unified reward function and terrain curriculum enable a single policy network to learn diverse parkour skills like high jumps, long jumps, ramp traversal, and handstands? 2) Can distilling a policy that relies on privileged information like scan dots and waypoint directions produce a deployable policy that operates only on onboard depth images and chooses its own heading based on terrain?3) Can such a policy overcome imprecise actuation and perception to produce precise control on a real low-cost quadruped robot for extreme parkour behaviors like 2x body length long jumps and 2x body height high jumps?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that end-to-end deep RL can unlock extreme parkour on low-cost legged robots despite imprecise sensing and actuation, by learning adaptive policies that map raw sensor inputs to precise motor commands. The key questions address learning diverse skills with a unified framework, distilling deployable policies, and sim-to-real transfer of these policies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a method for a legged robot to perform extreme parkour behaviors directly from raw sensor inputs, without explicit mapping or planning. Specifically:- They train a single neural network policy end-to-end using reinforcement learning in simulation to generate agile and precise motor commands directly from depth images captured by an onboard camera. - They propose a novel dual distillation approach to transfer the policy to the real robot. In the first phase, the policy is trained with privileged information like scandots and heading directions. In the second phase, it is distilled into a policy that operates only from onboard depth images and predicts its own heading directions.- They design simple yet effective inner product based reward functions that lead to the emergence of diverse parkour skills like high jumps, long jumps, handstand walking, and traversing titled ramps within a single policy.- They demonstrate a quadruped robot performing very challenging behaviors like high jumps over obstacles 2x its height, long jumps over gaps 2x its length, and walking on just its front legs. This pushes low-cost legged robots to new limits.In summary, the key contribution is showing that an end-to-end learned approach can achieve precise and extreme parkour on imprecise robots by learning to map raw inputs to outputs, without needing explicit planning or mapping. The simple and unified formulation leads to more impressive emergent behaviors than engineered policies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

This paper presents an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to train a quadruped robot to perform extreme parkour maneuvers directly from raw depth images, without relying on explicit mapping or planning. The key ideas are a unified inner-product reward formulation to acquire diverse skills, dual distillation to predict optimal heading directions, and automatic terrain curriculum to aid exploration in RL. The robot can perform long jumps across gaps 2x its length, high jumps over obstacles 2x its height, walk on two legs, and traverse ramps, using a single neural network policy operating on images from an imprecise onboard camera.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper focuses on robotic parkour behaviors, which is a relatively new and challenging area compared to more established locomotion tasks like walking and running. There have been some prior works on robotic parkour, but this paper pushes the capabilities further.- The paper uses a low-cost quadruped (Unitree A1) as the robot platform. Other recent parkour works have used higher-end industry quadrupeds like Anymal or Vision60. Using a low-cost platform poses additional challenges due to imprecise actuation and sensing.- The key technical approach is training an end-to-end neural network policy using reinforcement learning in simulation. This differs from classical approaches that decompose the problem into separate perception, planning, and control modules. Other RL papers on legged locomotion have used end-to-end policies, but this paper tailors the approach to parkour.- The behaviors demonstrated include high jumps over tall obstacles, long jumps over wide gaps, walking on tilted ramps, and handstands. These capabilities surpass previous robotic parkour results in terms of relative jump heights and lengths compared to the robot's dimensions.- The work proposes some modifications to prior end-to-end RL methods like a two-phase distillation approach for control and heading direction, and a general inner-product based reward formulation. These contributions aim to address challenges specific to learning parkour skills.- Concurrent to this work, a few other papers have also demonstrated quadruped parkour skills using alternative approaches. But this work achieves more dynamic behaviors on a low-cost platform.In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in robotic parkour through innovations in training methodology and by demonstrating extremely dynamic behaviors on a budget platform. The end-to-end learned control approach contrasts with classical modular designs.
