# [Understanding Long Videos in One Multimodal Language Model Pass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding complex video content requires awareness of objects, their movements, and interactions over time. 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on video tasks but it's unclear if this is due to actual video understanding or just leveraging of world knowledge.
- There is a need for efficient video understanding frameworks that fuse multimodal information.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first proposes "Likelihood Selection", an efficient technique to enable LLMs to solve multiple choice tasks in one forward pass instead of costly iterative sampling.
- Two constrained LLM variants are introduced - one with no video input, and one with a single frame - to study the effect of world knowledge vs video input. Surprisingly, these achieve strong accuracy, indicating spurious correlation in some benchmarks.
- A full framework called Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) is then proposed to fuse object-centric multimodal video information (global objects, spatial locations, motion trajectories) extracted using off-the-shelf models and represented in natural language.

Main Contributions:
- Likelihood Selection for efficient LLM-based choice selection
- Uncovering strong performance of modality constrained baselines, challenging notions of video understanding in some benchmarks
- MVU framework achieving SOTA on multiple long-video QA datasets by fusing multimodal information through language  

The key idea is to leverage the world knowledge and language understanding strengths of LLMs while explicitly injecting additional video-specific modalities interpretably using language as a fusion mechanism. Both the efficiency and strong performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated through extensive experiments.
