# [Understanding Long Videos in One Multimodal Language Model Pass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding complex video content requires awareness of objects, their movements, and interactions over time. 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on video tasks but it's unclear if this is due to actual video understanding or just leveraging of world knowledge.
- There is a need for efficient video understanding frameworks that fuse multimodal information.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first proposes "Likelihood Selection", an efficient technique to enable LLMs to solve multiple choice tasks in one forward pass instead of costly iterative sampling.
- Two constrained LLM variants are introduced - one with no video input, and one with a single frame - to study the effect of world knowledge vs video input. Surprisingly, these achieve strong accuracy, indicating spurious correlation in some benchmarks.
- A full framework called Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) is then proposed to fuse object-centric multimodal video information (global objects, spatial locations, motion trajectories) extracted using off-the-shelf models and represented in natural language.

Main Contributions:
- Likelihood Selection for efficient LLM-based choice selection
- Uncovering strong performance of modality constrained baselines, challenging notions of video understanding in some benchmarks
- MVU framework achieving SOTA on multiple long-video QA datasets by fusing multimodal information through language  

The key idea is to leverage the world knowledge and language understanding strengths of LLMs while explicitly injecting additional video-specific modalities interpretably using language as a fusion mechanism. Both the efficiency and strong performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated through extensive experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a multimodal video understanding framework, MVU, that fuses object-centric information from videos using language to achieve state-of-the-art performance on long-video question answering benchmarks under zero-shot operation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Likelihood Selection: An efficient technique for LLM-based choice selection in a single forward pass.

2. Uncovering surprisingly strong performance on complex video-language tasks by resulting modality-constrained baselines. 

3. Proposing the MVU framework for language-based fusion of video-specific modalities extracted using off-the-shelf models. The MVU framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on long video understanding benchmarks.

So in summary, the paper proposes an efficient video understanding framework called MVU that fuses multimodal video information using language and demonstrates its effectiveness on complex video QA tasks compared to modality-constrained baselines. The key ideas are likelihood selection for faster LLM inference and language-based fusion of additional video modalities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes extracting three forms of object-centric information from videos - global object information, object spatial locations, and object motion trajectories. How are each of these modalities represented and integrated into the framework using natural language? What are the benefits and limitations of using language as the fusion medium?

2. The paper introduces a technique called "likelihood selection" to enable efficient answer selection from an autoregressive language model with a single forward pass. How does this method work? What objective function is optimized and how is it approximated from the network logits? 

3. The paper evaluates two modality-constrained baseline variants - Vid-LLM using only language, and Vid-VLM using an additional single frame. What insights did the surprisingly strong performance of these baselines provide about the amount of video-specific understanding required for solving existing video QA benchmarks?

4. How exactly does the proposed framework perform frame selection? What is the motivation behind formulating it as a likelihood selection problem? Does this provide any benefits over standard frame sampling techniques?

5. What are the key differences between the object spatial locations and object motion trajectories extracted in the framework? How may encoding explicit motion information lead to better video understanding?

6. How does the paper formulate video action recognition as a question answering problem to evaluate on the Robotics domain datasets? What adaptations were made and why was this investigation important?

7. What models and datasets were used for evaluating the approach? Were the models re-trained in any manner or used off-the-shelf? What compute resources were utilized?

8. The paper ablation studies the contribution of different components like frame selection, individual modalities etc. What key conclusions can be drawn from these results about the framework design?

9. How exactly does the paper establish the efficiency gains and accuracy improvements from using likelihood selection over traditional autoregressive decoding? What factors contribute to these benefits?

10. The paper argues language provides interpretability for information fusion while also serving as an integration medium. What examples support these claims? Could the object-centric modalities instead be fused visually or is language superior?
