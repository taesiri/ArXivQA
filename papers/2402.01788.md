# [LitLLM: A Toolkit for Scientific Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents LitLLM, a toolkit to help scientists write literature reviews or related work sections for their research papers. The key problem it aims to solve is that conducting literature reviews is a tedious and time-consuming task. Existing systems that automatically generate such reviews using large language models (LLMs) have significant limitations - they tend to hallucinate non-factual information and ignore latest research. 

To address these limitations, LitLLM operates on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) principles to ground the generated text in factual content. The system takes a user's draft abstract as input. It first summarizes this into keywords to retrieve potentially relevant papers. Users can provide additional papers or keywords to supplement retrieval. Retrieved papers are re-ranked based on relevance to the input draft abstract. Finally, the top ranked papers are used as context to generate the related work section. 

The system also incorporates sentence-based planning for more controllable generation. By specifying a plan structure indicating what to cite where, the output can be tailored to author preferences.

The main contributions of the paper are:
1) A modular pipeline system to conduct literature review from a draft abstract based on RAG to reduce hallucinations
2) Incorporation of multiple search techniques including paper recommendations to allow user customization  
3) Sentence-level planning for controllable text generation

The open-source toolkit aims to substantially reduce the time and effort required for literature review. The paper demonstrates the system's utility via a user study and provides sample output. Future work includes ingesting full papers and exploring multi-database search.
