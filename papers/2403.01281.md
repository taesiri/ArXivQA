# [Fast Low-parameter Video Activity Localization in Collaborative Learning   Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01281)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Standard activity recognition methods focus on short videos of distinct actions by individuals. They do not address challenges like associating activities with a person over long videos, detecting subtle activities performed simultaneously by multiple people in close proximity, and working with limited training data.

- This paper aims to develop a system to detect typing and writing activities in long real-world classroom videos featuring groups of students working collaboratively. These activities are subtle, lack clear start/end points, involve occlusion, and transition rapidly between one another.

Proposed Solution: 
- A modular activity detection pipeline is proposed, comprised of:
   1) Fast object tracking to generate activity region proposals
   2) Separate low-parameter 3D CNN classifiers to detect typing and writing activities
   3) Interactive web-based visualization of detected activities

- Tracking keyboards with brief re-detection and projection-based filtering of hand detections are used to propose regions potentially containing typing/writing.

- A family of efficient dyadic 3D CNNs optimized for depth and frame rate are employed as separate typing and writing classifiers.

Main Contributions:
- Very fast, separable, low-parameter, and memory-efficient 3D CNN models for typing/writing classification, using 18.7K parameters and running at 4,620 FPS

- Modular pipeline enabling replacement of components and leveraging limited training data

- Optimization techniques for model depth, input frame rate and batch size enabling real-time performance

- Interactive web-based visualization associating detected activities with students over long durations

- Combining tracking, projection, and detection to generate activity proposals for subtle simultaneous actions in complex real-world videos

In summary, the paper presents an innovative activity detection system uniquely equipped to handle the challenges of analyzing collaborative classroom videos, with both technical and practical contributions.
