# [Rethinking E-Commerce Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- E-commerce search faces challenges in understanding user queries and matching them to products, which requires real-world knowledge. 
- Traditional approaches convert unstructured data like reviews into structured catalogs, which is costly and low quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Convert structured catalog data into text descriptions with embedded product IDs.
- Train large language models (LLMs) on this text combined with other corpora.
- Use the fine-tuned LLM for search - it understands queries and can refer to products by their IDs.

Main Contributions:
- A new architecture that combines databases with LLM instead of replacing databases. LLM acts as the search interface.
- Methods to convert structured data into "annotated text" with entity IDs for LLM training. Both manual and LLM-generated templates. 
- Approach to generate text from database content as well as aggregate queries. Conveys information like commonly purchased products.
- Discusses model training, inference, latency optimizations, personalization, catastrophic forgetting.

In summary, the paper proposes an architecture that leverages the understanding capacity of LLMs and couples it with real-time databases for facts. This amalgamates the strengths of both to overcome key limitations of current e-commerce search systems.
