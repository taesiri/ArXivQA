## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new architecture for e-commerce search that integrates databases and large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to convert structured product data like catalogs and taxonomies into natural language text, embed product IDs into the text, and use this to train or fine-tune an LLM. During search, the LLM generates text containing relevant product IDs in response to queries. Then the product IDs are used to retrieve up-to-date information from the database. This leverages LLMs' strength in query understanding and world knowledge while still connecting to real-time product data. Compared to traditional approaches of converting all information to structured data, it simplifies the system architecture. Research challenges include latency optimization, personalization, avoiding catastrophic forgetting as data changes, and more. Overall, the vision is an end-to-end LLM + database solution for e-commerce search that outperforms existing systems.
