## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fuzzing JavaScript (JS) engines is challenging due to their strict grammar requirements. Recently, researchers have adopted language models (LLMs) for context-aware mutation to address this. However, existing LLM-based fuzzers perform mutations in a black-box manner without utilizing coverage information. The paper shows that simply replacing AFL's mutator with an LLM reduces errors but struggles to increase coverage, sometimes even below random fuzzing. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new technique called CovRL (Coverage-guided Reinforcement Learning) that combines LLMs with reinforcement learning from coverage feedback to enable more effective JS engine fuzzing. 

The key idea is to integrate coverage information directly into the LLM-based mutator using a coverage-weighted reward calculated with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). This coverage-weighted map assigns weights based on the inverse frequency of coverage occurrences, incentivizing the discovery of new coverage. The coverage-weighted reward is applied to the LLM-based mutator via reinforcement learning.

Main Contributions:

1. Introduces CovRL, a novel technique that combines LLMs with reinforcement learning from coverage feedback using TF-IDF to construct a coverage-weighted map. This enables advanced coverage-guided fuzzing by directly integrating coverage information into the LLM.

2. Implements CovRL-Fuzz focused on JS engine fuzzing. Evaluation shows it outperforms existing fuzzers in coverage and bug-finding, without needing extra post-processing.

3. CovRL-Fuzz identified 48 real-world bugs in latest JS engines, including 39 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 11 CVEs.

In summary, the paper pioneers effectively integrating LLM-based mutators into coverage-guided fuzzing through a coverage-weighted reward mechanism. CovRL outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers, finding a substantial number of bugs.
