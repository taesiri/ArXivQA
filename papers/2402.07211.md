# [Towards Fast Stochastic Sampling in Diffusion Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Diffusion models can generate high-quality samples but suffer from slow sampling speed during inference. Recent progress has focused on accelerating deterministic samplers, but stochastic samplers can achieve better sample quality. 

- Most efforts have focused on diffusions purely in data space. Augmented diffusions that couple data variables with auxiliary momentum variables can improve sample quality and likelihood but improving sampling efficiency for such models is still underexplored.

- The paper aims to develop efficient stochastic samplers applicable to broader diffusion models like augmented diffusions, that can achieve high sample fidelity even with greatly reduced network function evaluation (NFE) budgets e.g. from 1000 to 100 or 50.

Methodology:
- The paper proposes using splitting integrators from molecular dynamics that split the dynamics into separate components solved independently. This exploits the separation of data and momentum variables in augmented diffusions.

- Three naive stochastic splitting schemes based on different compositions (OBA, BAO, OBAB) are proposed. These outperform baseline stochastic sampler but still have room for improvement at very low NFEs.

- To address this, several modifications are made: (1) Score function reuse between consecutive position and momentum updates; (2) Modified timestep conditioning for half-steps; (3) Controlling noise injection. 

- The resulting reduced splitting integrators significantly improve over naive versions. The best performing reduced OBA sampler is denoted SPS.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on sampling from a pre-trained PSLD model on CIFAR-10. SPS achieves a sample FID of 2.36 in only 100 NFE, compared to 2.63 for best baselines.

- Further experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA show SPS outperforms recent competing stochastic samplers on both datasets given the same NFE budgets.

Contributions:
- First application of splitting integrators for efficient stochastic sampling in diffusion models. Identify need for modifications over naive application.

- Propose several principled improvements to form reduced splitting integrators that outperform prior stochastic sampling methods under low NFE constraints.
