# [Synthetic Prompting: Generating Chain-of-Thought Demonstrations for   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00618)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper introduces a method called "Synthetic prompting" to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models when given only a few examples. The key ideas are:

- Use a few seed examples to prompt the language model to synthesize more demonstrative examples itself, by alternating between a backward process (generate question from reasoning chain) and forward process (generate reasoning chain for question). 

- Select the most effective demonstrations from the synthesized set using a scheme based on in-cluster complexity, to maximize diversity and complexity.

- Prompt the model with selected synthetic demonstrations during inference to elicit better reasoning compared to just using the limited seed examples.

So the main hypothesis is that prompting the model to synthesize its own demonstrations and selecting good ones can significantly improve its reasoning performance with few examples, compared to existing prompting techniques. The method aims to address the limitation that manually creating many high-quality demonstrations is costly and tedious.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Synthetic prompting to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models when given limited examples. The key ideas are:

- Using a few seed examples to prompt the language model to generate more examples by itself through an alternating backward-forward process. 

- The backward process generates a question that matches a sampled reasoning chain, making the question solvable. 

- The forward process produces a more detailed reasoning chain for the question.

- Selecting effective demonstrations from the augmented set of examples using a scheme based on in-cluster complexity, which aims to maximize diversity and informativeness.

- Prompting the language model with the selected demonstrations results in better reasoning performance compared to using the original limited examples.

So in summary, the core novelty is using the language model's own generative capabilities to synthesize more demonstrations and selecting good ones to improve its reasoning, rather than just using the original limited examples. The method is evaluated on numerical, symbolic and algorithmic reasoning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract, this paper introduces a novel method called Synthetic Prompting for eliciting better reasoning from large language models using limited demonstrations. Here are a few key points of comparison to other related work:

1. Relationship to in-context few-shot learning:

- This work is related to in-context few-shot learning, where large language models (LLMs) perform reasoning tasks by mimicking demonstrations in the prompt context. 

- However, rather than directly using the limited demonstrations for inference, this method uses them as seeds to synthesize more examples via prompting. It then selects effective examples from the augmented set to prompt the LLM.

2. Comparison to prompting techniques:

- This extends prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and PAL prompting that guide LLMs to reason step-by-step.

- The key difference is it leverages model-generated demonstrations rather than relying solely on provided examples. The synthetic prompting elicits better reasoning compared to using the original examples.

3. Relationship to knowledge distillation from LLMs:

- Prior work has distilled knowledge like examples and rules from LLMs, often for further training. 

- This work is novel in distilling examples specifically to improve the LLM's own reasoning when given limited demonstrations, without additional training.

4. Demonstration selection schemes:

- This introduces a new selection method based on in-cluster complexity to ensure diversity and complexity.

- It shows improved performance over selection by similarity or complexity alone.

In summary, this paper presents a novel synthesis-based prompting approach that outperforms existing prompting methods on reasoning tasks given limited demonstrations. The idea of leveraging the model's own knowledge to elicit better reasoning is an important advancement in few-shot in-context learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper does not explicitly suggest specific future research directions. However, based on my reading, here are some potential future directions that could be explored:

- Developing more advanced techniques for synthesizing effective demonstrations. The current method relies on simple prompting, so more sophisticated methods could potentially generate higher quality and more diverse examples. This could improve the models' reasoning abilities.

- Exploring different schemes for selecting demonstrations during inference. The in-cluster complexity method works well, but other selection strategies based on complementary reasoning styles or adaptiveness to the test question might further improve performance. 

- Applying the synthetic prompting approach to other reasoning tasks beyond the numerical, symbolic and algorithmic tasks tested. The method may also be effective for commonsense reasoning, causal reasoning, etc.

- Extending synthetic prompting to other model architectures besides the autoregressive LLM used. Testing whether other model types like retrieve-and-refine models can also benefit from synthetic prompting.

- Leveraging synthesized examples for further training/tuning of the models, rather than just prompting. The examples could provide additional training data to improve reasoning skills.

- Developing methods to inject external knowledge into synthetic prompting, to reduce reliance on the model's existing knowledge. This could address cases where the model fails to synthesize high-quality examples due to knowledge gaps.

- Theoretically analyzing the properties of synthetic prompting and providing insight into why it improves reasoning. Formalizing the impact on the model's knowledge representation.

- Combining synthetic prompting with other prompting enhancements like decomposed prompting, self-ask prompting, etc. Exploring complementarity with other recent prompting innovations.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Synthetic Prompting for improving reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) when given only a few examples. Synthetic Prompting uses a small set of seed examples to prompt the LLM to generate additional examples itself through a backward-forward synthesis process. In the backward process, the LLM generates a question conditioned on a topic word, target reasoning complexity, and a self-generated reasoning chain, to ensure the question is solvable. In the forward process, the LLM generates a reasoning chain for the synthesized question to refine and improve it. The process repeats to create a large set of synthetic examples. During inference, a subset of diverse and complex examples are selected from this augmented set to prompt the LLM to reason through a given test question. 

The method is evaluated on numerical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks. Results show Synthetic Prompting significantly outperforms strong baselines like chain-of-thought prompting and PAL prompting that directly use the seed examples, with absolute gains up to 15.6%. This demonstrates that prompting the LLM to synthesize its own examples, and using those to elicit its reasoning abilities, is more effective than just using the limited seed examples themselves. The work provides a promising technique for improving reasoning and generalization in LLMs from small data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Synthetic Prompting, a method to improve few-shot reasoning performance of large language models. The key idea is to use a few examples as seeds to synthesize more demonstrations via the model itself, and then select effective demonstrations from the augmented set to prompt the model during inference. 

Specifically, the method alternates between a backward process and a forward process to generate new examples. In the backward process, the model generates a question conditioned on a sampled reasoning chain, to ensure the question is solvable and well-defined. In the forward process, the model produces a more precise reasoning chain for the question, improving the chain's quality. 

To select demonstrations, examples are clustered and the most complex one from each cluster is chosen, which aims to maximize diversity and informativeness. Experiments on numerical, symbolic and algorithmic reasoning tasks show improved performance over baselines. The key novelty is using the model's own knowledge to synthesize demonstrations and improve its reasoning, instead of solely relying on limited provided examples.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper is introducing a method called "Synthetic prompting" to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models when given only a small number of demonstration examples. The key ideas are:

- Using the limited demonstration examples as "seeds" to prompt the language model to synthesize more examples itself, by alternating between a backward process (generating questions from reasoning chains) and forward process (generating reasoning chains for questions). 

- Selecting the most effective demonstrations from the synthesized set using a scheme based on in-cluster complexity, which aims to maximize diversity and informativeness.

- Prompting the language model with the selected demonstrations during inference to elicit better reasoning, rather than just using the limited seed examples.

The motivation is that creating many high-quality demonstration examples by hand is costly and tedious, but existing methods rely heavily on the quality of the examples provided. So this work explores using the model's own generative capabilities to create more examples automatically from limited seeds.

The main evaluation is on numerical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and algorithmic reasoning tasks. Results show the method outperforms existing prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, demonstrating the benefits of using self-synthesized examples to prompt better reasoning from the model.
