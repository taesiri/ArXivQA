# [RankMixup: Ranking-Based Mixup Training for Network Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we improve the confidence calibration of deep neural networks by leveraging ordinal ranking relationships between raw samples and mixup-augmented samples during training?The key hypotheses are:- Networks should give higher confidence predictions for raw samples compared to mixup-augmented samples.- Among multiple mixup-augmented samples, those with larger mixing coefficients (closer to raw samples) should get higher confidence predictions. - Exploiting these ordinal ranking relationships as supervisory signals, instead of just using label mixtures, can improve calibration of network predictions.The authors propose a new mixup-based training framework called RankMixup that implements these ideas through a mixup-based ranking loss (MRL) and M-NDCG loss. The goal is to improve calibration of deep networks by aligning confidence predictions with the expected ranking relationships.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents RankMixup, a novel mixup-based framework for network calibration that alleviates the problem of exploiting label mixtures as supervisory signals. The main contributions are:- Proposes to use ordinal ranking relationships between confidences from raw and augmented samples as supervisory signals instead of label mixtures. This addresses the issue that label mixtures may not accurately represent the distribution of augmented samples. - Introduces two losses - Mixup Ranking Loss (MRL) and M-NDCG loss - to align confidences with the ranking relationships. MRL encourages lower confidences for augmented samples compared to raw ones. M-NDCG aligns orders of confidences and mixup coefficients for multiple augmented samples.- Achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance on CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets compared to other mixup-based methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of using ranking relationships rather than label mixtures.- Shows the approach generalizes well to different network architectures, datasets, and mixup techniques. Also demonstrates improved out-of-distribution detection.In summary, the main contribution is a new mixup-based calibration framework that uses ranking relationships between raw and augmented samples as supervisory signals instead of potentially inaccurate label mixtures to improve calibration performance. The proposed losses effectively implement this idea.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel mixup-based framework called RankMixup for calibrating deep neural network predictions during training. The key ideas and contributions can be summarized as follows:- Motivation: Existing mixup-based calibration methods directly use the interpolated labels of mixup augmented samples as supervision. However, these labels may not accurately represent the distribution of the actual label mixtures. To address this issue, RankMixup proposes to leverage ordinal ranking relationships between confidences as supervision instead of the label mixtures.- Main Idea: RankMixup exploits two types of ranking relationships - (1) between raw and augmented samples, and (2) among multiple augmented samples. It assumes higher confidences are favorable for raw samples compared to augmented ones, and for augmented samples with larger mixup coefficients compared to ones with smaller coefficients. - Technical Contributions:    - Introduces two losses - MRL and M-NDCG to align confidences with the assumed ranking relationships.   - MRL encourages lower confidences for augmented samples compared to raw ones.   - M-NDCG aligns order of confidences with that of mixup coefficients.   - Achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance on CIFAR and TinyImageNet datasets.   - Shows better generalization ability by working with different mixup techniques like CutMix and Manifold Mixup.- Comparisons to prior work:   - Outperforms previous mixup-based calibration methods by avoiding use of inaccurate label mixtures.   - Provides better calibration than ranking-based method CRL by exploiting more complex relationships.   - Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art like MbLS.In summary, RankMixup provides a novel perspective on leveraging mixup for calibration by using ranking relationships instead of label mixtures as supervision. The proposed losses offer better alternatives for training calibrated models. The empirical evaluations demonstrate improved generalization ability and state-of-the-art performances across datasets and network architectures.
