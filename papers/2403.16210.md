# [Frankenstein: Generating Semantic-Compositional 3D Scenes in One   Tri-Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing 3D generative models typically output a single, unified 3D shape. However, downstream applications often require semantically-decomposed 3D shapes (e.g. separate components for a vehicle or avatar model). Although 3D segmentation can be applied, performance is currently unsatisfactory, often leading to incomplete fragments. Therefore, the authors aim to develop a generative AI model that can directly generate semantic-compositional 3D scenes where each component has a complete shape. This is challenging because it requires: 1) A versatile 3D representation to jointly model multiple semantic components; 2) Modeling complex relationships between components including relative positioning and avoiding interpenetration.

Proposed Solution:
The authors present Frankenstein, a tri-plane diffusion-based approach to generate semantic-compositional 3D scenes. Key ideas:

- Representation: Extend tri-plane tensor to represent compositional shapes by decoding multiple SDFs from a single tri-plane. Each SDF contains the shape of a semantic class. Allows modeling multiple complete shapes in one tri-plane.

- Training: 
    1) Tri-plane Fitting: Convert training scenes into tri-planes encoding shape and relationship information 
    2) VAE: Compress tri-planes into more compact latent space
    3) Diffusion: Train model to approximate distribution of latent tri-planes

- Applications: Generate room interiors and human avatars with automatically separated parts. Enables downstream applications like part-wise texturing, object rearrangement, avatar cloth retargeting.

Main Contributions:
- First 3D diffusion model to generate semantic compositional scenes in one tri-plane with a single forward pass
- Robust coarse-to-fine optimization for high-fidelity semantic-compositional tri-planes
- Demonstration of capabilities for generating rooms and avatars with control over individual components

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative tri-plane based diffusion model that can generate complex 3D scenes with semantic decomposition into individual components in a single forward pass. This allows for more control and downstream applications compared to traditional unified 3D generation.
