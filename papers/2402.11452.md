# [AutoPRM: Automating Procedural Supervision for Multi-Step Reasoning via   Controllable Question Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for multi-step reasoning tasks, but their reliance on extensive manual labeling to provide step-by-step feedback remains a major bottleneck. 
- Existing procedural supervision approaches require intensive human effort and can introduce bias.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called AutoPRM to automate procedural supervision for fine-tuning LLMs' reasoning abilities. 
- AutoPRM breaks down complex reasoning problems into more manageable subquestions using a controllable decomposition module. It then sequentially solves the subquestions with a reinforcement learning-optimized question answering module.
- A key insight is training one unified model to handle both question decomposition and answering, so they enhance each other. Context-guided decoding is used to avoid reward tampering and guide the QA model to solve subquestions while progressing towards the final solution.

Main Contributions:  
- AutoPRM significantly improves LLM performance on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with much less need for manual supervision.
- Thorough experiments demonstrate AutoPRM's effectiveness and versatility. The automated question decomposition and RL-optimized answering components are shown to be critical for the gains.
- AutoPRM can be easily integrated with other orthogonal reasoning pipelines for further improvements.

In summary, the key innovation of AutoPRM is using automated question decomposition and reciprocal enhancement of decomposition and answering to provide procedural supervision for fine-tuning LLMs, achieving new state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy.
