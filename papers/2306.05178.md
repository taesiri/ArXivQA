# [SyncDiffusion: Coherent Montage via Synchronized Joint Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05178)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:A novel synchronization module called SyncDiffusion can be incorporated into joint diffusion models to generate panoramic images that are both locally seamless and globally coherent. The key ideas seem to be:1) Existing approaches to generating panoramas via diffusion models, such as sequential extrapolation or naive joint diffusion, often produce unrealistic or incoherent outputs by simply blending images/features across windows.2) A synchronization module based on gradient descent guidance from a perceptual similarity loss computed on predicted denoised images can increase global coherence while maintaining local seamlessness. 3) This module can work in a zero-shot manner by leveraging pretrained diffusion models without retraining.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a specially designed synchronization module can enhance joint diffusion to produce panoramic images that have both seamlessness and coherence, which was lacking in prior work. The paper presents SyncDiffusion as the proposed implementation and provides both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate its effectiveness.
