# [SyncDiffusion: Coherent Montage via Synchronized Joint Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05178)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:A novel synchronization module called SyncDiffusion can be incorporated into joint diffusion models to generate panoramic images that are both locally seamless and globally coherent. The key ideas seem to be:1) Existing approaches to generating panoramas via diffusion models, such as sequential extrapolation or naive joint diffusion, often produce unrealistic or incoherent outputs by simply blending images/features across windows.2) A synchronization module based on gradient descent guidance from a perceptual similarity loss computed on predicted denoised images can increase global coherence while maintaining local seamlessness. 3) This module can work in a zero-shot manner by leveraging pretrained diffusion models without retraining.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a specially designed synchronization module can enhance joint diffusion to produce panoramic images that have both seamlessness and coherence, which was lacking in prior work. The paper presents SyncDiffusion as the proposed implementation and provides both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate its effectiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new method called SyncDiffusion for generating coherent and seamless panorama images using diffusion models. 2. Introducing a synchronization module that guides the reverse diffusion process to achieve global coherence across the panorama image. This module computes a perceptual similarity loss between predicted denoised images and performs gradient descent to synchronize the noisy images across different windows.3. Demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that SyncDiffusion can generate panoramas that are more coherent compared to prior methods like Blended Latent Diffusion and MultiDiffusion. 4. Conducting experiments using Stable Diffusion 2.0 to generate panoramas and showing improved coherence measured by metrics like LPIPS and Style Loss while maintaining fidelity and compatibility with the input text prompt.5. Performing a user study that confirms the coherence of panoramas generated by SyncDiffusion is preferred by humans over 66% compared to a baseline.In summary, the key contribution is proposing SyncDiffusion, a novel synchronization module that can be integrated with existing joint diffusion frameworks to improve the global coherence of generated panorama images in a zero-shot manner without retraining diffusion models. The effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative metrics and human evaluations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:The paper proposes SyncDiffusion, a new plug-and-play module that synchronizes multiple image diffusions to generate coherent and seamless panorama montages, by using gradient descent guidance from a perceptual similarity loss measured on the predicted denoised images at each diffusion step.
