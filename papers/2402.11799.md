# [Decentralized Multi-Robot Navigation for Autonomous Surface Vehicles   with Distributional Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) face challenges safely navigating congested marine environments with unknown static obstacles and strong currents, especially when following traditional maritime "rules of the road" (COLREGs) which can cause conflicting actions. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a decentralized multi-ASV collision avoidance policy based on Distributional Reinforcement Learning (Distributional RL) which considers interactions between ASVs as well as static obstacles and currents. 

- The policy network encodes relations between ego ASV, static obstacles, and other ASVs. Training agents share this network to induce coordinated collision avoidance. 

- Distributional RL captures return distributions rather than only expected returns as in traditional RL. This enables risk-sensitive policies by distorting distributions.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluation in simulation compares proposed Distributional RL policy against traditional RL, Artificial Potential Fields, and Velocity Obstacles in environments with increasing complexity.

- Distributional RL achieves highest success rate across complexity levels, with nearly minimal travel time and energy cost. Safety further improves with automatic risk adaptation.

- Approach is decentralized, learns via trial-and-error without reliance on COLREGS, and handles complex interactions between multiple ASVs, static obstacles, and currents.

- Significantly advances state-of-the-art in safe, efficient multi-ASV navigation in realistically congested environments.

In summary, the paper proposes a Distributional RL solution for decentralized, coordinated collision avoidance among multiple marine vehicles handling complex interactions with the environment and each other. Key advantages over other methods are demonstrated through simulations.
