# [GLeaD: Improving GANs with A Generator-Leading Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03752)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve GAN training by establishing a fairer competition between the generator and discriminator? 

The key hypothesis is that assigning the discriminator an additional "generator-leading" task, where it must reconstruct images using features that align with the generator's view, will force the discriminator to learn more useful representations instead of freely discriminating. This in turn will alleviate the unfairness between the generator and discriminator in standard GAN training.

In summary, the paper proposes a new adversarial training paradigm that gives the generator more influence over the discriminator by having it assign an image reconstruction task. This is hypothesized to make GAN training more equitable and improve synthesis performance.
