# [SPAD : Spatially Aware Multiview Diffusers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-quality and 3D consistent novel views of objects given an image or text description is an important problem. However, prior works have limitations in consistency across views, accurate camera control, visual quality, and generalization to unseen objects. 

Solution:
The paper proposes Spatially Aware Diffusion Models (SPAD) to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1) Fine-tune a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model on multi-view rendered images to enable cross-view feature interactions. However, vanilla self-attention leads to issues like content copying between views. 

2) Introduce Epipolar Attention to constrain cross-view interactions based on epipolar geometry. This allows better camera control.

3) Further enhance consistency by using Plücker ray coordinates as positional encodings in self-attention. This helps spatially close views attend to each other while preventing flipped view predictions.

Together, these modifications make the diffusion model spatially aware and suitable for novel view synthesis.

Contributions:
- Propose modifications like Epipolar Attention and Plücker Embeddings to make diffusion models spatially aware and suitable for multi-view generation
- Achieve state-of-the-art image-conditioned novel view synthesis results on Objaverse and Google Scanned Objects datasets
- Enable high quality text-to-3D generation using proposed model via Score Distillation Sampling or feedforward triplane prediction network
- Extensive ablation studies demonstrating usefulness of each component 

Overall, the paper presents a novel way to adapt powerful 2D diffusion models for multi-view 3D tasks through geometric constraints. The proposed SPAD model sets new state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis.
