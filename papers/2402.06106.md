# [CLR-Face: Conditional Latent Refinement for Blind Face Restoration Using   Score-Based Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Blind face restoration aims to recover a high-quality facial image from a degraded low-quality input, without knowning the exact type and amount of degradation. Most existing approaches struggle to balance between preserving identity and restoration quality. Methods relying on highly compressed latent spaces prioritize visual quality but often fail to preserve intricate identity-related facial details. On the other hand, using more expressive latent spaces makes optimization extremely difficult with existing techniques.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a iterative latent space refinement technique using a conditional diffusion prior to address the trade-off. The key ideas are:

1) Use a VQVAE backbone with mild compression (f=4 instead of 32) for an expressive latent space to enable better fidelity. Model the complexity of this space using a multi-step iterative refinement strategy with diffusion priors instead of direct one-step prediction.

2) Deploy a separate Identity Recovery Network (IRN) focused on reconstructing identity-specific features from the degraded input, which is used to initialize and steer the iterative refinement to prevent deviation from ground truth identity.

3) Introduce a learnable latent mask to constrain the identity-preserving gradient updates only to the subset of latents corresponding to identity, instead of blindly enforcing it on the entire latent. This prevents deterioration of perceptual quality.

Main Contributions:

- Novel framework combining VQVAE and iterative latent refinement with diffusion priors for blind face restoration

- Using more expressive latent space (milder compression) than prior arts and handling the complexity through multi-step diffusion

- Separate IRN for identity recovery along with learnable latent masking strategy to balance identity and perceptual quality  

- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world blind face restoration datasets, in terms of restoration quality as well as identity preservation and downstream face recognition tasks.
