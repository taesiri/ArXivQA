# [Pre-registration for Predictive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18807)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

Amid concerns about the replicability of results in machine learning research, the authors propose adapting the practice of pre-registration from explanatory modeling fields like psychology and medicine. Pre-registration involves declaring the details of an analysis plan before conducting it, which helps reduce data-dependent decision-making that can invalidate results. The authors present a two-phase lightweight pre-registration protocol tailored to predictive modeling work, covering problem definition and modeling choices. They report on a qualitative study observing PhD students using the protocol, where they saw indications it could curb overfitting and test set reuse, provided adherence. Participants saw value in how pre-registration encourages intentionality and separates confirmatory from exploratory work, though they noted practical challenges to adoption. The authors discuss strengths and limitations of pre-registration for improving the reliability of predictive modeling research, cautioning that it depends on proper application and is not a blanket solution for broader issues with reproducibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes adapting pre-registration practices from explanatory modeling to predictive modeling in order to improve the reliability and reproducibility of results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a two-phase pre-registration protocol for predictive modeling research. Specifically:

1) The authors adapt the concept of pre-registration from explanatory modeling research to the context of predictive modeling. They provide a lightweight template (Table 1) with questions for researchers to complete prior to model training (Phase A) and prior to model testing (Phase B).

2) Through a qualitative study, they observe 6 PhD students applying the pre-registration protocol to a predictive modeling task. They find evidence that using the protocol can prevent biased performance estimates and test set overuse, provided researchers adhere to their pre-registered plans.

3) They discuss situations where pre-registration is most likely to improve research practices in predictive modeling (e.g. lack of new test data, many researcher degrees of freedom) versus limitations of what problems it can solve (e.g. construct validity, distribution shift).

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and initial evaluation of a pre-registration protocol aimed at improving research practices and results in predictive modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Pre-registration - Adapting the practice of pre-registering analysis plans from explanatory modeling/experimental sciences to predictive modeling in order to improve reliability and replicability.

- Predictive modeling - Building models to directly forecast outcomes rather than estimate causal effects. Concerns exist around reproducibility despite advances.

- Replication crisis - Failures to replicate published research findings, originally more associated with explanatory modeling but concerns raised for predictive modeling as well. 

- Researcher degrees of freedom - Flexibility in data analysis choices that allow tuning results to expectations, a key factor in replication failures.

- Data leakage - Unintentional transfer of information from test data to training data, causing overfitting.

- Test set reuse - Repeatedly accessing the test set to evaluate models, leading to inflated performance estimates. 

- Contextual factors - Details like computational budgets and random seeds that can substantially impact results but often go unreported.

- Operationalization - Translating a high-level research question into a concrete predictive modeling exercise, with many researcher degrees of freedom.

- Two phase protocol - The proposed pre-registration procedure adapted for predictive modeling - Phase A before any modeling, Phase B after validation before testing.

- Qualitative study - Interviews with machine learning PhDs using the pre-registration protocol showing benefits but also adoption challenges.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes adapting pre-registration practices from explanatory modeling to predictive modeling. What are some key differences between explanatory and predictive modeling that make this adaptation non-trivial? For instance, what common practices or assumptions in predictive modeling might conflict with the goals of pre-registration?

2. The paper outlines a two-phase pre-registration protocol. What is the motivation behind having two phases rather than a single pre-registration? What are the key elements that the authors believe should be pre-specified in each phase?

3. One critique of pre-registration is that it places too many constraints on exploratory analyses. How does the paper's two-phase protocol aim to balance pre-specification with flexibility for researchers? Are there ways this balance could be improved?

4. Could the requirements for pre-registering certain details (e.g. data transformations, metrics, etc.) actually discourage researchers from being transparent about these choices in their final papers? Why or why not?

5. The qualitative study explores how machine learning PhD students interact with and perceive the pre-registration protocol. What were some of the key benefits and drawbacks they identified? How might the protocol be refined to address some of the drawbacks?

6. Under what conditions do the authors believe pre-registration will be most impactful for improving the validity of predictive modeling research? When might pre-registration provide fewer guarantees or benefits?

7. The paper argues pre-registration will help address problems like data leakage and multiple test set access. However, what are some examples of threats to validity and generalizability that pre-registration does NOT address?

8. How does the concept of pre-registration for predictive modeling compare to other related reform initiatives like reporting checklists for machine learning or registered reports? What unique benefits might pre-registration provide?

9. What are some practical next steps the authors propose for actually implementing pre-registration more widely in the machine learning community? What infrastructural or cultural changes would need to take place?

10. The paper focuses specifically on pre-registration, but are there other practices from explanatory modeling and social science that you believe could be usefully adapted to predictive modeling as well? Why or why not?
