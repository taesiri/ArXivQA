# [Bayesian causal discovery from unknown general interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00509)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a Bayesian methodology for causal discovery from interventional data generated under a general framework that allows modifications of the parent sets of unknown intervention targets. The authors first establish identifiability results, providing graphical criteria to characterize interventional Markov equivalence classes of DAGs and interventions. They then construct a Bayesian model which leverages these theoretical results to enable compatible parameter prior elicitation and score equivalence of indistinguishable DAGs. An effective MCMC scheme for posterior computation and inference is also introduced. The methodology is specialized to Gaussian DAGs and empirically evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating superior performance over methods designed for more restrictive interventions. An application to protein expression data from leukemia patients reveals targeted interventions and structural modifications associated with disease subtypes. Overall, this work makes important theoretical and methodological contributions for causal discovery under flexible assumptions regarding the effects of unknown interventions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a Bayesian methodology for causal discovery from multivariate interventional data allowing for unknown general interventions which modify the parent sets of intervened nodes; it establishes identifiability results, provides graphical characterizations, develops compatible priors leading to closed-form marginal likelihoods that guarantee score equivalence, and constructs an MCMC scheme for posterior inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Bayesian methodology for causal discovery from general interventions, which allow modifications of the parent sets of unknown intervention targets. This is more flexible than existing methods that assume interventions either destroy or only alter parent-child relations without changing parent sets.

2. It provides graphical characterizations and identifiability results for DAGs and general interventions, introducing notions like interventional Markov equivalence classes. 

3. It develops a framework for parameter prior elicitation that leads to closed-form DAG marginal likelihoods and guarantees score equivalence for indistinguishable DAG structures.

4. It devises an MCMC scheme to sample from the posterior distribution over DAGs, intervention targets and modified parent sets, allowing for Bayesian inference on these quantities. 

5. It evaluates the proposed methodology on simulated Gaussian data and real protein expression data, demonstrating its applicability.

In summary, the paper develops a comprehensive Bayesian approach for causal discovery that relaxes assumptions about the nature of interventions and allows learning complex effects of unknown interventions from a combination of observational and experimental data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the notion of a general intervention that allows for modifications of the parent sets of the target nodes compare to traditional definitions of hard and soft interventions? What additional flexibility does it provide? 

2. Explain the concept of I-Markov equivalence introduced in the paper. How does it differ from standard Markov equivalence and what does it imply about the limits of causal DAG identifiability under general interventions?

3. The paper assumes I-faithfulness. What is the justification for this assumption and what would be the implications if it were violated? Could violations provide insights into the causal mechanisms?

4. The paper develops a Bayesian methodology. What is the motivation for taking a Bayesian approach as opposed to a frequentist one? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages in this context?  

5. Explain how the concept of simultaneously covered edges extends previous definitions of covered edges to the context of general interventions across multiple experimental settings. Why is this concept important?

6. The method involves first learning differences between experimental contexts and then inferring the specific intervention targets. What is the rationale behind this strategy? What are the potential limitations?

7. Discuss the motivation behind using the Median Probability Model for estimating DAG structures from the posterior. How does this relate to aims of predictive accuracy?

8. What assumptions are made about the likelihoods and priors? When might they be violated in practice and what would be the implications?  

9. The method has only been evaluated in simulation studies and on a single protein expression dataset. What steps would need to be taken to more thoroughly validate its real-world performance?

10. How might the method be extended to allow for latent confounders or feedback cycles? What theoretical and computational challenges would this introduce?
