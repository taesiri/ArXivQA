# [Bayesian causal discovery from unknown general interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00509)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a Bayesian methodology for causal discovery from interventional data generated under a general framework that allows modifications of the parent sets of unknown intervention targets. The authors first establish identifiability results, providing graphical criteria to characterize interventional Markov equivalence classes of DAGs and interventions. They then construct a Bayesian model which leverages these theoretical results to enable compatible parameter prior elicitation and score equivalence of indistinguishable DAGs. An effective MCMC scheme for posterior computation and inference is also introduced. The methodology is specialized to Gaussian DAGs and empirically evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating superior performance over methods designed for more restrictive interventions. An application to protein expression data from leukemia patients reveals targeted interventions and structural modifications associated with disease subtypes. Overall, this work makes important theoretical and methodological contributions for causal discovery under flexible assumptions regarding the effects of unknown interventions.
