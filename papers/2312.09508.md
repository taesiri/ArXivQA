# [IndicIRSuite: Multilingual Dataset and Neural Information Models for   Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of large-scale datasets and models for monolingual neural information retrieval (IR) in Indian languages. Existing datasets like FIRE are small and domain-specific. This limits the development of neural IR systems for Indian languages. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce IndicIRSuite which contains two main components:
  1) INDIC-MARCO: A multilingual dataset for 11 Indian languages created by machine translating the MSMARCO dataset. It contains 39 million training examples per language.
  2) Indic-ColBERT: A set of 11 monolingual neural IR models, one for each language trained on INDIC-MARCO. It is based on ColBERTv2 architecture with mBERT encoder.

Key Contributions:
- INDIC-MARCO is the first large-scale dataset for training neural IR systems in 11 major Indian languages. 
- Indic-ColBERT achieves 47.47% higher MRR@10 over INDIC-MARCO baselines across languages (except Oriya).
- 20% improvement in MRR@100 over baseline on Bengali test set of Mr. Tydi dataset. 
- 19.29% higher NDCG@10 score over baselines on Bengali test set of MIRACL dataset.

Conclusion:
- IndicIRSuite advances the state-of-the-art in neural IR for Indian languages by providing datasets and models across 11 languages. Experiments show significant gains over competitive baselines. Future work includes extending it for cross-lingual and multilingual IR.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces IndicIRSuite, a multilingual dataset of 11 Indian languages and corresponding neural information retrieval models, to advance monolingual and cross-lingual IR research for Indian languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of IndicIRSuite, which includes:

1) INDIC-MARCO: A large-scale multilingual dataset for training neural information retrieval (IR) models in 11 widely spoken Indian languages - Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. This dataset contains over 39 million training triplets.

2) Indic-ColBERT: A collection of 11 distinct monolingual neural IR models, each trained on the INDIC-MARCO dataset for one of the 11 Indian languages. Experiments show Indic-ColBERT outperforms baselines on several IR benchmark datasets. 

In summary, the authors have created the first large-scale neural IR dataset and models for 11 Indian languages to advance monolingual IR research for these languages. This represents the main contribution of the paper.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using the int-8 quantized version of the NLLB-1.3B-Distilled Model for machine translation. What are the advantages of using the int-8 quantized version over the non-quantized version? How does quantization enable faster inference?

2. When translating the MSMARCO passages, the paper splits them into sentences before translation. Why is it important to sentence split passages before translating them? How does this impact translation quality and computational efficiency? 

3. The method trains 11 separate Indic-ColBERT models, one for each Indian language. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of training language-specific models compared to a single multilingual model?

4. When training the Indic-ColBERT models, only the first 6.4 million triplets are used. What motivated this design choice? Would using the full training set yield better performance? What are the tradeoffs?

5. How exactly does the max-sim function in Indic-ColBERT compute relevance between encoded query and document representations? What makes this an effective scoring function?

6. When testing on the Mr.Tydi dataset, why does Indic-ColBERT substantially outperform baselines for Bengali but not for Telugu? What differences between the languages could explain this?

7. For the Assamese language, the paper notes a significant improvement over baselines likely due to similarity with Bengali. What techniques could help improve performance for languages that are dissimilar from others in the training set?

8. The conclusion mentions extending IndicIRSuite for cross-lingual IR. What modifications would need to be made to the model architecture and training to support cross-lingual retrieval?

9. What additional experiments could be conducted to better analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the Indic-ColBERT model on different language families (Indo-Aryan vs Dravidian) and on various domains?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on text retrieval. How could techniques like Indic-ColBERT be extended to other modalities like speech and images to support multimodal search in Indian languages?
