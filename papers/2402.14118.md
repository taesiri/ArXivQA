# [Masked Matrix Multiplication for Emergent Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emergent sparsity is occurring in AI workloads, especially in transformer models, where computations exhibit selective sparse access to dense data. 
- This sparsity is inefficient to compute on hardware optimized for dense linear algebra. 
- Existing sparse computation techniques also do not map well due to finer-grained sparse access patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Masked Matrix Multiplication (MMM) technique that eliminates unnecessary computations based on runtime evaluation of sparsity patterns.
- MMM encodes sparse access patterns in the matrices using masks rather than converting to explicit sparse data structures.
- It relies on random fine-grained sparsity in one matrix and aligned block sparsity in the second matrix.
- MMM uses dynamic code lookup to select optimized compute kernels matching the block sparsity patterns. 
- It also preprocesses sparsity bitmaps to minimize runtime branching.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates performance gains from exploiting dual-sided sparsity in matrix multiplication, which maps poorly to existing techniques.
- Introduces optimizations including dynamic code lookup, precomputation of sparsity, and vectorization to map sparse patterns to dense hardware.  
- Quantifies benefits across a range of sparsity levels and matrix sizes, showing up to 2x speedups over standard libraries.
- Analyzes emergent sparsity in transformer models and shows benefits on matrices extracted from Deja Vu system.
- Performance gains indicate potential for specialized hardware support for dual-sided sparse matrix multiplication.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel MMM technique to map emergent sparsity onto dense hardware using dynamic adaptation and preprocessing, demonstrating performance improvements on transformer model matrices.
