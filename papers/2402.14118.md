# [Masked Matrix Multiplication for Emergent Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emergent sparsity is occurring in AI workloads, especially in transformer models, where computations exhibit selective sparse access to dense data. 
- This sparsity is inefficient to compute on hardware optimized for dense linear algebra. 
- Existing sparse computation techniques also do not map well due to finer-grained sparse access patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Masked Matrix Multiplication (MMM) technique that eliminates unnecessary computations based on runtime evaluation of sparsity patterns.
- MMM encodes sparse access patterns in the matrices using masks rather than converting to explicit sparse data structures.
- It relies on random fine-grained sparsity in one matrix and aligned block sparsity in the second matrix.
- MMM uses dynamic code lookup to select optimized compute kernels matching the block sparsity patterns. 
- It also preprocesses sparsity bitmaps to minimize runtime branching.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates performance gains from exploiting dual-sided sparsity in matrix multiplication, which maps poorly to existing techniques.
- Introduces optimizations including dynamic code lookup, precomputation of sparsity, and vectorization to map sparse patterns to dense hardware.  
- Quantifies benefits across a range of sparsity levels and matrix sizes, showing up to 2x speedups over standard libraries.
- Analyzes emergent sparsity in transformer models and shows benefits on matrices extracted from Deja Vu system.
- Performance gains indicate potential for specialized hardware support for dual-sided sparse matrix multiplication.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel MMM technique to map emergent sparsity onto dense hardware using dynamic adaptation and preprocessing, demonstrating performance improvements on transformer model matrices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a matrix multiplication system called Masked Matrix Multiplication (MMM) that eliminates unnecessary computations and avoids branches when multiplying matrices with emergent sparsity patterns commonly found in transformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new matrix multiplication system called Masked Matrix Multiplication (MMM) that is optimized to efficiently handle the emergent sparsity observed in artificial intelligence workloads like transformer models. Specifically:

- MMM eliminates unnecessary computations at runtime by detecting zero values, while avoiding extra branches/overhead typically incurred when mapping sparse computations to dense hardware primitives.

- It uses a combination of dynamic code lookup to adapt to the sparsity patterns in one matrix (B), along with preprocessing the sparsity maps of the input matrices (A and B) to move conditional branches out of the inner loops.

- Evaluations show MMM can outperform Intel MKL's dense and sparse matrix multiplication routines across a wide range of sparsity levels (60-95% zeros), providing up to 2x speedups and 4x fewer instructions executed.

- The paper demonstrates the performance benefits on synthetic randomized sparse matrices as well as real matrix data from transformer model inference.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a new sparse matrix multiplication algorithm and system optimized for the dual-sided sparsity common in emerging AI workloads, providing performance improvements over existing dense and sparse matrix multiplication approaches.

The paper introduces the concept of Masked Matrix Multiplication (MMM) to better leverage emergent sparsity that arises in transformer models and AI workloads at runtime. MMM uses techniques like dynamic code lookup, preprocessing of sparsity maps, and leveraging block sparsity patterns to avoid unnecessary computations on zeros. It shows benefits over standard dense and sparse matrix multiplication approaches from Intel MKL for intermediate sparsity levels. The key ideas focus on adapting to sparse access patterns in matrices at runtime to reduce instructions and improve performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the masked matrix multiplication (MMM) method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that MMM works best when there is randomness bit sparsity in matrix A and block random sparsity in matrix B. What are some ways the performance of MMM could be improved for other sparsity patterns in A and B?

2. Preprocessing seems to be a key aspect of MMM to encode sparsity patterns and build lookup tables. How much does the preprocessing overhead limit the size of matrices for which MMM is beneficial? Could any optimizations help reduce this overhead?

3. The paper demonstrates MMM benefits on up to 8 cores. What types of optimizations or changes would be needed to show strong scaling to much larger CPU or GPU parallelism? 

4. How does the choice of pattern size for building the code lookup table affect performance? What are the tradeoffs in terms of table size, preprocessing, and ability to capture finer-grained sparsity?

5. Could a just-in-time compilation approach be used instead of preprocessing to build the optimized code tables? What might be the tradeoffs of that approach?

6. How well could the MMM approach extend to other sparse computations beyond matrix multiplication, such as convolutional neural networks? What would need to change?

7. The paper mentions MMM could be implemented on GPUs. What changes would be needed to effectively handle GPU warp behavior and synchronization? 

8. How does the performance of MMM compare when using different vector instruction widths (AVX2 vs AVX512)? What optimization opportunities exist?

9. What types of hardware support could improve the performance of MMM's approach? Are there ideas from sparse accelerators that could help?

10. How do the performance benefits of MMM change when looking at power efficiency or energy usage rather than just runtime? Would the savings increase?
