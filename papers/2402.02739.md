# [DisDet: Exploring Detectability of Backdoor Attack on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative AI technique and are widely used for content generation and editing. However, their vulnerability against backdoor attacks is still under-explored.
- Recent works have shown the feasibility of backdoor attacks on diffusion models by adding a predefined trigger pattern to the input noise. However, the detectability of such attacks, a critical metric affecting overall attack performance, is not studied.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper first analyzes the properties of existing trigger patterns and discovers the distribution discrepancy of noise input can be used to detect poisoned inputs. A distribution-based detection method is proposed.
- The paper then studies the problem from the attack side by proposing a strategy to learn an unnoticeable trigger that can evade the detection scheme. This is done by:
1) Optimizing the trigger to minimize distribution discrepancy between poisoned and clean noise.
2) Incorporating noise consistency loss to facilitate predicting noise in poisoned inputs.
3) Performing end-to-end learning of stealthy trigger and backdoored diffusion model.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first distribution discrepancy-based detection method for backdoored diffusion models, which effectively detects existing attack triggers.
- Develops a novel backdoor attack strategy to learn stealthy triggers that can evade the proposed detection scheme with high attack success rate.
- Performs in-depth experiments across various datasets and models to demonstrate effectiveness of proposed detection and attack methods.

The paper provides important insights into the vulnerability of diffusion models against backdoor attacks from both defender and attacker perspectives. The proposed solutions advance understanding of security issues with this emerging generative AI technique.
