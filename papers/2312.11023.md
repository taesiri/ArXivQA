# [Frequency Spectrum is More Effective for Multimodal Representation and   Fusion: A Multimodal Spectrum Rumor Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal content mixing text and images poses challenges for rumor detection in social media. 
- Existing approaches suffer from less discriminative representation within each modality and vulnerability to intricate location dependencies when fusing multimodal features across modalities.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion Network (FSRU) for multimodal rumor detection. 
- FSRU transforms spatial features into the frequency domain using Fourier Transform. The resulting frequency spectrum provides a sparse and global representation to obtain highly discriminative unimodal features and effectively fuse multimodal features.

Key Components of FSRU:
- Text and image embedding modules to obtain unimodal embeddings
- Frequency spectrum representation and fusion module, involving:
   - Discrete Fourier Transform to convert spatial features to frequency domain  
   - Unimodal spectrum compression to extract informative components
   - Cross-modal spectrum co-selection to emphasize relevant and suppress irrelevant frequency components
   - Inverse Fourier Transform to convert back to spatial domain
- Rumor detection module with distribution similarity measurement and contrastive learning objectives

Main Contributions:
- Novel multimodal rumor detection method operating in the frequency domain, providing a new perspective compared to existing spatial/sequential domain techniques
- Frequency spectrum representation and fusion module to obtain discriminative unimodal representations and fuse multimodal evidence effectively
- Superior performance over existing methods on two real-world datasets while being architecturally simple and computationally efficient

In summary, the key innovation is the use of frequency spectrum to achieve effective yet efficient multimodal representation and fusion for rumor detection in social media.
