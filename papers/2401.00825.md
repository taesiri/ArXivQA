# [Sharp-NeRF: Grid-based Fast Deblurring Neural Radiance Fields Using   Sharpness Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) can render high-quality novel views of a scene. However, the input images often contain defects like blurring which hurts NeRF's performance. Specifically, defocus blur is common in images captured with regular cameras.
- Existing deblurring NeRF methods use MLPs to model scene properties and generate blur kernels. This leads to very long training times. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Sharp-NeRF, a fast grid-based deblurring NeRF framework. 
- It uses discrete learnable kernels directly optimized on grids, removing the need for kernel-generating MLPs. This allows spatially-varying blur to be modeled efficiently.

- A sharpness prior based on a defocus map is introduced. It measures sharpness levels of pixels and assigns them to groups. Discrete kernels are learned for each group.  

- Random patch sampling is used instead of ray sampling. patches share neighboring rays, reducing redundant computations.

Main Contributions:
- Grid-based learnable blur kernels that can be optimized directly without extra networks
- Incorporation of a sharpness prior to reliably measure spatial variation of blur
- Adoption of patch sampling to limit computations and accelerate training

- Experiments show the method renders sharp novel views comparable or better than state-of-the-art deblurring NeRFs, in under 30 minutes of training. It also outperforms prior arts in no-reference metrics like Niqe and Brisque.

In summary, the paper presents a fast grid-based deblurring NeRF approach incorporating discrete learnable kernels and sharpness priors. It achieves an excellent trade-off between speed and quality.
