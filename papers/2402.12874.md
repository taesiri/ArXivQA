# [Skill or Luck? Return Decomposition via Advantage Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In reinforcement learning (RL), the return (cumulative reward) of a trajectory depends on both the agent's actions (skill) and the environment's randomness (luck). It is important for the agent to properly attribute the return to skill versus luck in order to learn effectively. This is known as the credit assignment problem.

- Existing RL algorithms like Monte Carlo methods and temporal difference learning utilize trajectories inefficiently and fail to disentangle skill versus luck. 

- Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE) was recently proposed to estimate the advantage function (the causal effect of an action on the return) more efficiently in the on-policy setting, but it cannot handle off-policy data.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a method to decompose the return into skill and luck components by treating the environment's randomness as actions from an imaginary "nature" agent.

- They show mathematically that the return can be decomposed into the value function (expected return), the advantage function (skill), and a new "nature advantage" function (luck).

- This decomposition allows them to naturally extend DAE to the off-policy setting (Off-policy DAE). The method minimizes the squared error between the decomposed return and actual returns using off-policy data, subject to constraints.

- They relate Off-policy DAE to prior methods:
   - It better utilizes trajectories compared to Monte Carlo methods
   - The commonly used uncorrected estimator is a special case of Off-policy DAE that ignores skill and luck

- Experiments in MinAtar show that modeling skill and luck is crucial for good performance, and Off-policy DAE outperforms prior off-policy methods.

Main Contributions:
- Mathematical decomposition of returns into value, skill (advantage), and luck components
- Extension of Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE) to off-policy settings
- Demonstrating the importance of disentangling skill and luck for off-policy learning both theoretically and empirically
- Relating Off-policy DAE to prior multi-step RL algorithms
