# [Robot Learning with Sensorimotor Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10007)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can we learn good representations for robotics from sensorimotor trajectories alone using self-supervised pre-training? Specifically, the authors propose and investigate a self-supervised sensorimotor pre-training approach where the model is trained to predict masked-out content from sequences of camera images, robot states, and actions. Their key hypothesis is that if the robot can predict the missing sensorimotor content, it has acquired a good model of the physical world that can enable it to act. The paper presents experiments analyzing the effectiveness of this pre-training approach on real-world robotic tasks.In summary, the main research question is whether self-supervised pre-training on sensorimotor trajectories alone, without any other supervision, can learn useful representations that transfer to downstream robotic tasks. The authors aim to demonstrate the viability of this approach.
