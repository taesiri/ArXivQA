# [RetMIL: Retentive Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathological Whole   Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis using deep learning is an important research area, but faces challenges due to the gigapixel-level resolution and lack of pixel-level annotations. 
- Existing transformer-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods for WSI suffer from high memory consumption, slow inference speed, and sometimes suboptimal performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new MIL method called RetMIL (Retentive MIL) which processes WSIs hierarchically using a retention mechanism instead of self-attention.
- At the local level, the WSI patch sequence is split into subsequences. Each subsequence is updated in parallel via a linear retention layer and aggregated using attention.  
- At the global level, the subsequences are aggregated into a global sequence, updated via another retention layer, and finally pooled to obtain a slide-level representation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a computationally cheaper linear retention mechanism to replace self-attention for modeling inter-patch correlations.
- Proposes a hierarchical feature propagation architecture to integrate multi-scale information in WSIs.
- Evaluated on 3 public histopathology datasets - CAMELYON, BRACS, and LUNG. RetMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while having lower memory cost and higher throughput compared to transformer-based MIL techniques.
- RetMIL also demonstrates good visualization and interpretability showing it can accurately focus on cancerous regions.

In summary, the paper introduces RetMIL, a new retentive MIL approach for histopathology WSI analysis that is faster, more memory-efficient and shows strong performance compared to existing MIL techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes RetMIL, a retentive multiple instance learning approach for histopathological whole slide image classification that uses linear retention mechanisms in a hierarchical architecture to reduce computational overhead while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new multiple instance learning (MIL) method called RetMIL for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Specifically:

1) RetMIL uses a linear retention mechanism to replace the commonly used non-linear self-attention in Transformer-based MIL methods. This helps reduce memory consumption and improve inference speed while still being able to model inter-patch correlations. 

2) RetMIL has a hierarchical architecture that processes WSI sequences at both local subsequence level and global sequence level to comprehensively characterize features at different scales in WSIs.

3) Extensive experiments on three public histopathology datasets demonstrate that RetMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational overhead compared to existing MIL methods. It works well for both balanced/imbalanced datasets and binary/multi-class classification tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is a new computationally efficient MIL approach RetMIL that pushes state-of-the-art performance on histopathology WSI analysis while having practical advantages of reduced memory consumption and improved throughput during inference.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical retentive aggregation architecture. Can you explain in more detail how the local and global sequences are updated and aggregated? What is the motivation behind this hierarchical design?

2. The retention mechanism in RetMIL replaces the self-attention mechanism commonly used in Transformers. Can you explain how the retention mechanism works and why it helps reduce computational overhead compared to self-attention? 

3. The paper claims that RetMIL has better performance for long sequences compared to Transformer-based methods. Why do you think the retention mechanism handles long sequences better? Can you analyze the complexity difference?

4. Attention pooling is used in RetMIL after both the local and global retention mechanisms. Explain the attention pooling layer and how the gate mechanism works to assign importance scores. 

5. The visualization results show that RetMIL can accurately highlight cancer regions. Analyze the attention score calculation, and discuss what factors contribute to the good visualization and interpretability.

6. How does RetMIL handle the varying number of patches between WSIs? Explain the patching splitting and concatenation used to create uniform-length subsequences.

7. The distance decay matrix Dh plays a key role in the retention mechanism. Explain how Dh is defined and why the relative distance between tokens matters. 

8. What motivated the design of RetMIL? What challenges with existing Transformer-based MIL methods is it aiming to address? Analyze the comparative results.

9. The pretrained feature extractor ViT-S/16 is fixed during RetMIL training. What is the motivation behind using a pretrained backbone? Should the backbone weights be fine-tuned?

10. How suitable do you think RetMIL would be for deployment in a clinical setting? Analyze the memory, speed, accuracy and other requirements for real-world histopathology analysis.
