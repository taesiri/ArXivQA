# [On Sensitivity of Learning with Limited Labelled Data to the Effects of   Randomness: Impact of Interactions and Systematic Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Approaches for learning with limited labelled data (e.g. in-context learning, fine-tuning, meta-learning) are sensitive to uncontrolled randomness introduced by various "randomness factors". This negatively impacts their stability and reproducibility. 
- Previous works have studied effects of randomness factors but there are inconsistencies due to disregarding interactions between the factors. Also, impact of systematic choices (e.g. number of classes, shots, prompt format) on randomness factors is not thoroughly explored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel investigation method that explicitly considers interactions between randomness factors. It measures the "contributed deviation" of each factor while mitigating others.
- Importance score is defined - the portion of overall deviation (from a "golden model") contributed by the factor over other factors. Factors with positive importance are considered significant.
- The method is used to study 5 factors on 7 text classification datasets using 4 in-context learning models, fine-tuning on BERT/RoBERTa and 3 meta-learning approaches.

Main Contributions:  
- Confirms that interactions cause incorrect attribution of effects between factors. Even sophisticated sample selection doesn't remove in-context learning's sensitivity to sample order.
- Sample choice is most important for in-context, while label selection and data split are important for both in-context and fine-tuning.
- Increased number of classes raises importance of sample order for in-context and reduces importance of sample order/initialization for fine-tuning.
- More shots reduces importance of sample choice but not sample order. Prompt format significantly impacts importance.

The paper proposes a novel systematic methodology to investigate the effects of different sources of randomness in learning with limited labelled data. It provides several new insights into the factors that impact stability of popular approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to investigate the effects of randomness factors on performance of approaches for learning with limited labeled data that explicitly considers interactions between factors and measures the importance of their effects, then applies this method to analyze 5 factors across in-context learning, fine-tuning, and meta-learning, finding sample choice most important for in-context learning while data order/model initialization importance depends on the approach, dataset classes, etc.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new method for investigating the effects of randomness factors that takes into account the interactions between different factors. The method mitigates the effects of non-investigated factors and measures the relative importance of investigated factors.

2. Using the proposed method, the paper investigates 5 randomness factors and their effects on in-context learning, fine-tuning, and meta-learning approaches across several text classification datasets. The results show that:

(a) Not taking interactions into account can lead to incorrect attribution of effects to different randomness factors. For example, in-context learning is not consistently sensitive to sample order when selections are random.

(b) The importance of factors like sample order depends not only on interactions, but also on systematic choices like number of classes, shots per class, and prompt format.

3. The paper provides an analysis of how factors like number of classes, shots per class, and prompt format impact the importance of different randomness factors for in-context learning.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed investigation method itself and the new insights it provides into the effects and importance of different randomness factors under different conditions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Randomness factors - refers to non-deterministic decisions in the training process that introduce uncontrolled randomness, such as sample order, model initialization, etc.

- Interactions between randomness factors - the paper investigates how interactions between different randomness factors can lead to incorrect attribution of effects to different factors.

- In-context learning - one of the main approaches analyzed, where a language model is prompted using a few examples and task instructions to make predictions.

- Fine-tuning - another approach analyzed, where a pre-trained language model is trained on a downstream task. 

- Meta-learning - the third learning approach analyzed, where the model learns to quickly adapt to new tasks.

- Stability - a key concept, referring to the sensitivity of a model's performance to small changes in parameters or data due to randomness factors.

- Importance score - a metric proposed to quantify the contribution of a randomness factor to overall variance relative to other factors.

- Prompt engineering/format - analyzed as a more systematic choice affecting importance of randomness factors.

So in summary, key terms cover the approaches analyzed, the concept of randomness factors, interactions between them, stability, and ways to quantify importance and effects.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel method to investigate the effects of randomness factors while taking interactions into account. Can you explain in detail the key steps of this proposed method and how it allows to mitigate the effects of non-investigated factors?

2. The concept of a "golden model" is introduced in the paper to estimate the overall performance deviation. What is this golden model, how is it constructed and what role does it play in determining the importance score of investigated factors? 

3. The paper argues that disregarding interactions between randomness factors can lead to incorrect attribution of their effects in existing works. Can you provide some examples from the paper that demonstrate this and explain why taking interactions into account helps address this issue?

4. The importance score represents the fraction of overall deviation a factor contributes over non-investigated ones. Walk me through how exactly this importance score is calculated step-by-step based on the proposed method. 

5. The number of investigation and mitigation runs is a key hyperparameter in the proposed method. What is the rationale behind the constraints provided in the paper for choosing suitable values of N and M? Discuss the reliability vs feasibility trade-off.  

6. What are some key differences between the "Random" and "Fixed" baseline investigation strategies discussed in the paper versus the proposed "Interactions" method? What are limitations of the baselines?

7. One conclusion from the experiments is that sample order is not consistently important for in-context learning when using random selection. Does this contradict or align with findings from previous works? Explain why.

8. How exactly does the choice of prompt format for in-context learning affect the importance of different randomness factors based on experiments in the paper? Compare between models.

9. The paper studies impact of number of classes and shots on sensitivity of factors. Summarize key observations from these experiments and discuss possible reasons behind them. 

10. The proposed method estimates the fraction of variance contributed by each factor. This could allow creating a ranking of factors by importance. Discuss how this could help guide further research on mitigation strategies.
