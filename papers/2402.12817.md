# [On Sensitivity of Learning with Limited Labelled Data to the Effects of   Randomness: Impact of Interactions and Systematic Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Approaches for learning with limited labelled data (e.g. in-context learning, fine-tuning, meta-learning) are sensitive to uncontrolled randomness introduced by various "randomness factors". This negatively impacts their stability and reproducibility. 
- Previous works have studied effects of randomness factors but there are inconsistencies due to disregarding interactions between the factors. Also, impact of systematic choices (e.g. number of classes, shots, prompt format) on randomness factors is not thoroughly explored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel investigation method that explicitly considers interactions between randomness factors. It measures the "contributed deviation" of each factor while mitigating others.
- Importance score is defined - the portion of overall deviation (from a "golden model") contributed by the factor over other factors. Factors with positive importance are considered significant.
- The method is used to study 5 factors on 7 text classification datasets using 4 in-context learning models, fine-tuning on BERT/RoBERTa and 3 meta-learning approaches.

Main Contributions:  
- Confirms that interactions cause incorrect attribution of effects between factors. Even sophisticated sample selection doesn't remove in-context learning's sensitivity to sample order.
- Sample choice is most important for in-context, while label selection and data split are important for both in-context and fine-tuning.
- Increased number of classes raises importance of sample order for in-context and reduces importance of sample order/initialization for fine-tuning.
- More shots reduces importance of sample choice but not sample order. Prompt format significantly impacts importance.

The paper proposes a novel systematic methodology to investigate the effects of different sources of randomness in learning with limited labelled data. It provides several new insights into the factors that impact stability of popular approaches.
