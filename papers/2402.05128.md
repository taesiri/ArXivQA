# [Enhancing Textbook Question Answering Task with Large Language Models   and Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenging task of textbook question answering (TQA). TQA requires complex reasoning and understanding of lengthy, multimodal contexts comprised of text and diagrams from science textbooks in order to accurately answer questions. Key challenges include handling long contexts (average 1,800 words), scarce training data (15k samples), and the "out-of-domain" problem where concepts are scattered across lessons. Prior works have shown limited reasoning abilities and inability to effectively leverage context.  

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes an architecture that utilizes the Large Language Model (LLM) Llama-2, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Llama-2 provides strong language understanding and generation capabilities. RAG enhances Llama-2 by retrieving relevant contexts across lessons to address out-of-domain concepts. SFT adapts Llama-2 to the textbook QA domain. The complete lesson is provided as context to handle long texts. Parameter efficient fine-tuning is used to update only a small subset of parameters to prevent catastrophic forgetting.  

Main Contributions:
1) Leveraging Llama-2 to comprehend full textbook lessons and questions within its context window.
2) Enhancing reasoning by fine-tuning Llama-2 on the TQA dataset.  
3) Implementing RAG to improve context relevance and handle out-of-domain concepts scattered across lessons.

The proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming prior works by 4.12% on the validation set and 9.84% on the test set for textual multiple choice questions. This demonstrates the impact of RAG and fine-tuning LLMs for advancing the TQA task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes enhancing textbook question answering performance by fine-tuning the large language model Llama-2 and incorporating retrieval augmented generation to improve reasoning abilities and handle lengthy contextual information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like Llama-2 to handle complete lessons and questions from the textbook QA (TQA) dataset within the model's context window. 

2. Enhancing the reasoning abilities necessary for answering complex questions in TQA by fine-tuning the pretrained LLM Llama-2 on domain-specific data from the TQA dataset (CK12-QA).

3. Implementing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) strategies to improve the quality and relevance of context generated by the LLM, addressing the "out-of-domain" problem where concepts are spread across different lessons.

So in summary, the key contribution is using Llama-2 fine-tuning and RAG to enhance reasoning and handle long context in the TQA task, leading to improved accuracy.

 Based on my review of the paper, the main keywords or key terms that summarize the main ideas and contributions are:

Natural language processing, textbook question answering, retrieval augmented generation, large language models, Llama-2, supervised fine-tuning, accuracy improvement.

To elaborate:
- The paper focuses on the task of textbook question answering (TQA), which requires natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. 
- It utilizes large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama-2, as the foundation, and incorporates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the model's context.
- Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Llama-2 on a TQA dataset, the model is adapted and optimized for the task.
- RAG and SFT together aim to improve the accuracy of the model on the TQA dataset. 
- Comparisons are made to previous state-of-the-art results, with the proposed methodology achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy levels.

So in summary, the key focus areas are natural language processing, TQA, the use of the LLM Llama-2, RAG, SFT, and accuracy improvements on the specific dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to reduce catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Can you explain in more detail how PEFT works and why it is effective at preventing catastrophic forgetting? 

2. The paper utilizes low-rank adaptation (LORA) as its PEFT technique. What are the advantages of using LORA over other PEFT methods? How does introducing trainable rank decomposition matrices help adapt the model while minimizing updated parameters?

3. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is used in this architecture to improve the model's input. Can you explain the full pipeline for how RAG functions, starting from embedding the textbook context to retrieving relevant passages? 

4. What similarity metric and vectorizer does the paper use for retrieving relevant passages in the RAG component? How are the choice of similarity metric and vectorizer optimized for a textbook QA task?

5. The incorporation of a re-ranking mechanism for RAG is mentioned. What is the purpose of having a re-ranking stage and how might it further improve results? What factors need to be considered in designing an effective re-ranking mechanism?

6. Ablation studies in the paper analyze the impact of various context window sizes and RAG configurations. Can you summarize the key insights from these studies? How do they demonstrate the tradeoffs with larger context sizes?

7. The paper analyzes the percentage of questions that require inferring answers from lessons other than the one they belong to. Why is handling this "out-of-domain" issue critical for the textbook QA task? How does RAG specifically address this challenge?

8. Can you explain the prompt engineering process used to format the CK12-QA data for fine-tuning Llama-2? What adjustments were made to the default auto-regressive objective and why?

9. The paper leaves integrating diagrams and other visual information for future work. What unique challenges arise when extending the method to handle visual QA? What modifications would be required?

10. What steps could be taken to further improve the reasoning and comprehension capabilities of the model? Are there other state-of-the-art methods or architectures you would recommend exploring?
