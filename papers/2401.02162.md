# [Frequency Domain Nuances Mining for Visible-Infrared Person   Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) mainly focus on designing complex networks or loss functions to extract modality-invariant features from the spatial domain. However, they neglect the discriminative frequency information which is crucial for reducing the modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images. 

Method:
This paper proposes a novel Frequency Domain Nuances Mining (FDNM) method to explore the cross-modality frequency domain information to minimize the modality discrepancy for VIReID. The key components are:

1) Amplitude Guided Phase (AGP) Module: Utilizes the key amplitude component information to guide the learning of the phase component, enabling the model to reduce modality discrepancy and learn robust cross-modality representations.

2) Amplitude Nuances Mining (ANM) Module: Mines diverse cross-modality nuances in the amplitude component using two convolutional branches, which promotes the learning of the AGP module. A center-guided nuances mining loss is proposed to preserve identity information while discovering diverse nuances.

3) Multi-Loss Optimization: Combines cross-entropy loss, triplet loss and the proposed center-guided nuances mining loss to jointly optimize the whole framework.

Main Contributions:

- First work to exploit frequency domain information for VIReID task. The proposed FDNM can effectively reduce modality discrepancy by mining frequency nuances.

- Novel AGP module to utilize amplitude information to guide phase component learning and extract robust cross-modality features.

- ANM module along with center-guided loss to mine diverse nuances while preserving identity information.

- Superior performance over state-of-the-arts on three datasets. Effectiveness is also validated on visible-infrared face recognition.

In summary, this paper explores an underexplored perspective of modeling frequency domain for VIReID task. The proposed FDNM provides an effective way to minimize the modality discrepancy by jointly modeling the amplitude and phase components in the frequency domain.
