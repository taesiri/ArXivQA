# [Perceptual Video Quality Assessment: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on perceptual video quality assessment (VQA) research. The key problem addressed is how to develop effective objective VQA models that can accurately predict the perceptual quality of videos as percieved by human viewers. 

The paper first reviews subjective VQA methodologies suggested by ITU-R for conducting human studies to collect quality ratings, covering aspects like test environment, stimuli preparation, subject selection, experiment process and data analysis. Several widely used subjective VQA databases for general and specific video applications are then summarized.

Next, the paper systematically reviews objective VQA models. Based on reference requirement, these models are divided into full-reference (FR), reduced-reference (RR) and no-reference (NR) metrics. FR metrics compare distorted videos to pristine references and popular algorithms are discussed based on handcrafted features vs learned representations. RR methods only require partial reference information while NR models predict quality in a blind manner. The paper further surveys objective quality models designed for specialized applications like VR videos, gaming videos etc. A performance comparison shows that learned approaches generally outperform traditional handcrafted feature based techniques.  

The paper also outlines promising future research directions which include better incorporating properties of human visual perception, exploring large multi-modality models for VQA, assessing quality of emerging media types and AI generated content, evaluating volumetric and light-weight green learning models for VQA.

In summary, this paper presents a holistic overview of the VQA field, covering historical progress as well as state-of-the-art. It can serve as an excellent reference for researchers to get an overview of the field and identify open challenges to explore further. By discussing a wide variety of VQA datasets, algorithms and applications, this survey can benefit advanced studies across multiple disciplines related to perceptual video processing, delivery and consumption.
