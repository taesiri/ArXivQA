# [ProPainter: Improving Propagation and Transformer for Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03897)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on improving video inpainting performance through enhancements to two key components: propagation and Transformer. Specifically, the paper proposes:

- Dual-domain propagation that combines global image propagation and local feature propagation to exploit long-range correspondences more reliably and effectively. This addresses limitations of previous works that perform propagation in only one domain.

- An efficient mask-guided sparse video Transformer that reduces unnecessary computations and memory usage. This aims to overcome the high computational and memory costs of standard video Transformers. 

The central hypothesis is that by improving these two core components - propagation and Transformer - through the proposed techniques, video inpainting performance can be significantly enhanced while maintaining efficiency. The dual-domain propagation provides more reliable and precise propagation, while the sparse Transformer reduces redundancy. Together, these improvements allow the model to generate higher quality inpainting results.

Experiments validate that the proposed model ("ProPainter") outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, achieving a 1.46 dB gain in PSNR over prior arts. This supports the hypothesis that the propagation and Transformer enhancements lead to improved video inpainting capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework named ProPainter for video inpainting, which consists of several key components:

- Recurrent Flow Completion (RFC): An efficient recurrent network to complete corrupted optical flow fields. This provides reliable flows to guide propagation.

- Dual-Domain Propagation (DDP): Performs propagation in both image and feature domains to combine global and local information. Image propagation uses completed flows for pixel warping. Feature propagation employs flow-guided deformable alignment for precise feature alignment. 

- Mask-Guided Sparse Video Transformer (MSVT): An efficient Transformer that discards unnecessary tokens using the inpainting mask as guidance. This reduces complexity while maintaining performance.

The main contributions are:

- Proposing dual-domain propagation to reliably aggregate both global correspondence from image warping and local contextual information from feature alignment.

- Designing a highly efficient recurrent flow completion network and mask-guided sparse Transformer to improve efficiency.

- Achieving state-of-the-art video inpainting performance with appealing efficiency. The method improves PSNR by 1.46dB over prior arts.

In summary, the key novelty is using enhanced propagation and an efficient Transformer tailored for video inpainting. This results in superior performance while maintaining high efficiency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in video inpainting:

- It combines both image and feature domain propagation. Most prior work uses propagation in only one domain. Using both allows exploiting global correspondence from image propagation and learnable refinement from feature propagation.

- It proposes an efficient recurrent network for flow completion. This is much faster than prior flow completion networks while maintaining accuracy. Fast flow completion enables longer-range propagation. 

- It introduces a mask-guided sparse Transformer to reduce computation and memory. Prior Transformers for video inpainting are computationally expensive. The masking strategy allows focusing attention only on key regions.

- Experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin (1.46dB PSNR), demonstrating the benefits of the proposed techniques.

- The dual propagation and sparse Transformer make the approach efficient. It can process high resolution 480p videos in real-time, while many other methods cannot due to memory limitations.

Overall, the key novelties are the dual domain propagation design and sparse Transformer to improve accuracy and efficiency. The paper provides useful insights into propagation and Transformer techniques for video inpainting through systematic analysis and evaluations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced flow completion networks that are more accurate and efficient. The authors note that flow completion is still a challenging problem and better flow estimates could enhance the propagation modules.

- Exploring longer-range temporal attention and propagation. The current methods are limited in the temporal range they can effectively model due to memory and computational constraints. Finding ways to enable attention across more distant frames could be beneficial.

- Applying the methods to higher-resolution videos. The experiments in the paper focus on relatively low resolutions around 480p. Scaling up the techniques to high-resolution videos is noted as an important research direction. 

- Extending the techniques to other video editing tasks beyond inpainting, such as video extrapolation, interpolation, etc. The dual-domain propagation and efficient Transformer could potentially benefit these related tasks as well.

- Improving the model efficiency and speed further to enable real-time video editing applications. Though the method is efficient relative to prior arts, further optimization of the models could enable real-time performance.

- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised training methods that do not require paired training data. The current model relies on paired video data which can be laborious to collect. Removing this requirement could make training more practical.

In summary, the main future directions aim to improve the core technical components, scale the methods to more challenging data, and extend the application domains. There is also interest in reducing the training data requirements and latency to make the techniques more practical.

The paper proposes a novel framework called ProPainter for video inpainting. The framework involves two key components - enhanced propagation and an efficient transformer - to achieve improved performance. 

First, ProPainter introduces dual-domain propagation that combines global image propagation and local feature propagation. Image propagation uses optical flow warping to fill in missing regions from distant frames. Feature propagation employs deformable alignment to complement image propagation using learnable offsets.
