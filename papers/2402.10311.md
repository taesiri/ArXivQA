# [The optimal placement of the head in the noun phrase. The case of   demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
The paper examines two competing principles that shape word order: syntactic dependency distance minimization, which predicts heads should be placed centrally, and surprisal/predictability maximization, which predicts heads should be placed initially or finally. The paper tests which principle dominates in short noun phrases consisting of a demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun.

Theoretical Predictions:
The paper argues that when sequences are short and words are short, predictability maximization should outweigh dependency distance minimization. This means the noun should tend to occur initially or finally in the noun phrase, forming a "bouquet" structure. The paper predicts this based on (a) fewer words placing less strain on memory limitations and (b) shorter words keeping overall dependency lengths manageable.

Empirical Analysis: 
The paper analyzes preferred orders of the noun phrase quadruplet across 576 languages. It finds the noun is placed initially or finally in 64% of languages - significantly more than chance. This confirms the prediction. Further analysis shows average dependency lengths are longer than chance, indicating predictability is dominating over dependency distance minimization. The effect is robust across different measurements of abundance over languages.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretically grounds and empirically confirms predictability maximization winning over dependency distance minimization when sequences are short and words are short
- Provides evidence against the noun phrase being optimally "balanced" with the noun centrally placed
- Supports the proposed set of sufficient conditions for predictability maximization overriding dependency distance minimization in word order preferences
- Adds to the evidence base on competing pressures shaping the structure of language
