## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is important for cancer diagnosis and grading. However, existing supervised methods rely heavily on large amounts of pixel-level annotations, which are labor-intensive to obtain. Semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to reduce dependency on manual annotations, but they struggle with pathological images due to subtle color differences between nuclei and tissues, as well as significant morphological variation of nuclei. Consequently, generated pseudo-labels often contain significant noise, especially at nuclei boundaries.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a boundary-aware contrastive learning network called BASS for semi-supervised nuclei segmentation. BASS has two key components:

1) Low-Resolution Denoising (LRD) Module: Employs low-resolution pseudo-labels as supervision to promote boundary smoothness. Also uses a low-weight loss on boundary regions to reduce impact of uncertain boundaries during training.

2) Cross-RoI Contrastive Learning (CRC) Module: Partitions nuclei regions into internal, external and boundary areas. Contrastive learning on features from these areas enhances discrimination between nuclei and background regions while addressing boundary noise.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces boundary-aware denoising methods to address the problem of boundary noise in pseudo-labels for semi-supervised nuclei segmentation.
- Proposes a coarse-to-fine strategy with LRD module for initial contour smoothing followed by CRC module for finely enhancing boundary discrimination.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two nuclei segmentation datasets, demonstrating effectiveness for pathological images.

In summary, this paper presents a novel approach to handle noisy pseudo-label boundaries in semi-supervised nuclei segmentation using boundary-aware contrastive learning. Both coarse and fine-grained strategies are employed to smooth contours and enhance discrimination of boundary regions.
