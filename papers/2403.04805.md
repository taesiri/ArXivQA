# [Not all tickets are equal and we know it: Guiding pruning with   domain-specific knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks are powerful models but suffer from lack of interpretability due to their high complexity and overparameterization. This limits their usefulness for scientific discovery.
- Neural network pruning methods aim to induce sparsity for efficiency and interpretability, but face difficulty in identifying truly sparse, meaningful architectures. They lack guidance from problem-specific structure and knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DASH, a domain-aware sparsity heuristic to guide neural network pruning using available domain knowledge and structural constraints. 
- DASH scores parameters based on alignment with prior knowledge, allowing control over the influence of priors vs learned weights. It finds optimally sparse architectures aligned with the data and domain constraints.

Contributions:
- Formulates DASH pruning approach for shallow networks, leveraging input-output or inter-variable relationship priors. Discusses potential extension to deeper networks.
- Applies DASH for inferring sparse, interpretable gene regulatory dynamics with Neural ODEs. Compares to baselines and state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real biological datasets.
- Shows DASH recovers much sparser (90%+), yet biologically meaningful and predictive models. Better reconstructs ground truth networks and known biology vs. competitors.
- Analysis shows DASH identifies disease-relevant pathways in cancer data missed by other methods. Uncovers differentiating blood cell biology better than existing techniques.
- Concludes domain-specific guidance is key for finding good sparse architectures aligned with true underlying systems. DASH serves as blueprint for informative structured pruning.
