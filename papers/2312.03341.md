## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GeMap, a novel framework for online vectorized high-definition (HD) map construction from camera images. GeMap introduces a geometric representation called G-Representation that captures the shapes of individual map instances (e.g. lanes, crossings) and the relations between instances (e.g. parallel lanes, perpendicular intersections) using displacement vectors between polyline points. This representation is invariant to translation and rotation. Based on G-Representation, the paper presents Euclidean shape and relation losses to supervise the learning of geometry. It also proposes a Geometry-Decoupled Attention mechanism in the decoder to focus on geometry within and across instances. Experiments on NuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, GeMap surpasses 70% mAP on Argoverse 2 for the first time. The results showcase that incorporating geometry in terms of G-Representation, losses, and attention brings notable improvements in perception and robustness for online HD map construction. Key strengths are the elegant translation/rotation invariance and the ability to model complex road system geometry like shapes and relations in an end-to-end learnable framework.
