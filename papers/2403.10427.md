# [SWAG: Splatting in the Wild images with Appearance-conditioned Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Implicit neural representation methods like NeRF have shown impressive results in novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured photo collections. However, they are limited by the large computational cost of volumetric rendering which constrains their application in practical scenarios requiring real-time rendering. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerged as a faster alternative but still suffers from poor performance on unstructured in-the-wild image collections containing varying lighting/weather conditions and transient objects like tourists.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SWAG, the first in-the-wild extension of 3DGS. It expands the capabilities of 3DGS and improves its robustness for unstructured photo collections in two ways:

1) Handles appearance variations by learning an image-dependent color for each Gaussian using an MLP that takes as input the Gaussian's color, spatial encoding of its center, and an image embedding. 

2) Handles transient objects through a learnable image-dependent opacity variation for each Gaussian. This is sampled from a concrete distribution to encourage opacity values to be either 0 or 1 during training. At test time, transient Gaussians can be identified and removed.

Main Contributions:

- First work to extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to unstructured in-the-wild image collections with varying lighting and transient objects
- Achieves state-of-the-art NVS results on Phototourism and NeRF-OSR datasets while having over 10x faster training and real-time rendering
- Enables controllable appearance generation and unsupervised transient object removal from captured scenes
- Demonstrates smooth interpolations between learned appearances and capability to render novel views with the visual appearance of any training image

In summary, the paper proposes a novel adaptation of 3DGS using image-dependent appearance and opacity modeling to achieve superior performance on in-the-wild image collections while retaining the efficiency benefits of splatting-based representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

SWAG extends 3D Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis from unstructured photo collections by modeling appearance variations with image embeddings and handling transient objects through learnable per-image Gaussian opacity modulation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing SWAG, the first method to extend 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to handle unconstrained photo collections with varying appearances and transient objects. 

2. Proposing to model appearance variation by conditioning the Gaussians' colors on per-image embeddings and an MLP. This allows capturing local appearance changes within each image.

3. Introducing a learnable image-dependent opacity variation for each Gaussian to identify and exclude transient/dynamic elements in the scene in an unsupervised manner. This also enables transient object removal at test time.

4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art neural rendering quality and efficiency on challenging outdoor landmarks datasets with varying lighting and containing transient occluders. The method achieves faster training and real-time rendering compared to previous implicit neural rendering techniques for such scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting the first work to extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to unconstrained photo collections through novel appearance and transient modeling, outperforming previous methods in terms of quality and efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this work include:

- 3D Gaussian Splatting: The paper builds upon and extends the 3D Gaussian Splatting method for novel view synthesis. This is a key technique that the paper focuses on.

- In-the-wild photo collections: The paper aims to adapt 3D Gaussian Splatting to handle unconstrained, in-the-wild image datasets with varying conditions.

- Appearance modeling: The paper models the appearance variations across images through per-image embeddings and an MLP that predicts image-dependent Gaussian colors. 

- Transient object handling: The paper introduces transient Gaussians with image-dependent opacity variations to handle occluders and enable transient object removal.

- Novel view synthesis: The overall goal is high-quality novel view synthesis from unstructured photo collections.

- Real-time rendering: The method achieves significantly faster training and inference compared to prior in-the-wild neural rendering techniques.

Some other potential terms: implicit neural representation, differentiable rendering, outdoor landmarks, varying lighting, changing conditions. But the keywords above seem to be the most essential to describing the key focus and contributions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does SWAG model the appearance variation in images? What are the inputs to the MLP used for appearance modeling and what does it output? How does this help handle appearance changes?

2. Explain the concrete distribution and temperature parameter used for sampling the opacity variation. Why is a binary concrete distribution suitable for this task compared to a simple Bernoulli distribution? 

3. The paper mentions using both global and local appearance modeling techniques. What were these techniques and why was the final solution using an MLP preferred over them?

4. Explain the complete workflow for rendering an image using SWAG. How does it differ from the original 3D Gaussian Splatting method?

5. What are transient Gaussians in SWAG? How are they identified during training and inference? Explain with an example scenario.  

6. How does modeling transient Gaussians help improve reconstruction of the static parts of a scene? What artifacts can occur if transient objects are not handled properly?

7. What are the major limitations of SWAG discussed in the paper? How do the authors suggest some of these could be addressed in future work?

8. Why can directly predicting per-Gaussian colors and opacities conditioned on viewpoint be intractable? How does SWAG get around this limitation?

9. Compare and contrast SWAG qualitative and quantitative performance with state-of-the-art neural rendering methods for novel view synthesis. What are its main advantages?

10. The hash grid encoder is used to encode the Gaussiansâ€™ centers. Explain its purpose and discuss the hyperparameters used to configure it in this work. How does it help enable local appearance modeling?
