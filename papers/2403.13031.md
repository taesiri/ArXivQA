 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "RigorLLM: Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models against Undesired Content":

Problem:
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities but also the potential to generate harmful and biased content, especially when exposed to malicious inputs. Existing mitigation strategies like instruction fine-tuning are expensive and still vulnerable to attacks. Thus, there is a need for efficient, robust guardrails to moderate both inputs and outputs of LLMs.  

Proposed Solution - RigorLLM:
This paper proposes RigorLLM, a novel framework with resilient guardrails to moderate harmful LLM inputs and outputs. The key components are:

1. Energy-based training data generation using constraints and Langevin dynamics to improve coverage of real-world harmful content.

2. Minimax optimization to append a safe suffix to inputs, enhancing resilience against jailbreaking attacks. 

3. Fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs using prompt augmentation to leverage strengths of both for detection.

Main Contributions:

1. Novel constrained optimization for data generation using similarity and fluency constraints based on Langevin dynamics. Uniquely bounds distribution shift between generated and real data.

2. Introduction of safe suffix optimization via minimax technique to improve LLM guardrail resilience against attacks.

3. Analysis and incorporation of KNN robustness properties into LLMs through a fusion-based guardrail approach with prompt augmentation.

4. Extensive experiments show RigorLLM outperforms SOTA baselines like OpenAI/Perspective APIs and LlamaGuard for moderation, and exhibits superior attack resilience, setting new standards for reliable LLM guardrails.

In summary, RigorLLM establishes a strong foundation for building more secure, resilient LLM guardrails against evolving threats through its multi-faceted defense approach.
