# [EmoWear: Exploring Emotional Teasers for Voice Message Interaction on   Smartwatches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Voice messages are increasingly used for communication, but prevent receivers from gauging the emotional tone without accessing the audio content. This hinders shared emotional experiences at the pre-retrieval stage.
- There is little research on providing "Emotional Teasers" - pre-retrieval cues offering a glimpse of an awaiting voice message's emotional undertone without revealing content.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents EmoWear, a smartwatch system for sending/receiving voice messages with animated "emotional teasers" on message bubbles to reflect emotions.  
- It uses 30 animations spanning 6 emotions (happiness, sadness, calmness, fear, surprise, anger).
- The interface prioritizes probable emotions using semantic/acoustic analysis to ease sender's selection while offering diverse options.

Contributions:  
- A novel smartwatch system, EmoWear, that enables emotional teasers for voice messaging using animated message bubbles.
- An empirical understanding of user experiences with such emotional teasers, through a 24-participant study comparing EmoWear with a color-coded baseline system.
- Key findings that animated teasers enhanced emotional communication experience, outperforming the baseline system on most metrics from the perspectives of both senders and receivers.
- Summarization of desirable qualities of emotional teasers and relevant contextual opportunities to inform future HCI research and design of such features.
- Discussion of implications like expanding emotion options, incorporating biosignals, and improving accessibility to make emotional teasers more inclusive.

In summary, the paper makes both system-level and empirical contributions towards the novel concept of emotional teasers for voice messaging, providing promising future research directions.
