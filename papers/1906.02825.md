# XRAI: Better Attributions Through Regions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces a new attribution method called XRAI and evaluates it against other popular attribution methods. The key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:- Can a region-based attribution method like XRAI improve on pixel-based methods like Integrated Gradients? The authors hypothesize that considering attributions at a region level rather than pixel level will produce better saliency maps.- How can attribution methods be reliably evaluated, given the lack of ground truth? The authors propose perturbation-based sanity checks as well as new evaluation metrics like Accuracy Information Curves and Softmax Information Curves.- How does XRAI compare to other attribution methods like Integrated Gradients, GradCAM, etc. on metrics like AUC and visual inspection? The authors hypothesize XRAI will outperform these other methods.So in summary, the main research questions relate to introducing a new region-based attribution method called XRAI, proposing better ways to evaluate attribution methods, and comparing XRAI against existing methods to demonstrate its superior performance. The key hypothesis is that XRAI will produce better saliency maps and outperform other attribution techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A new region-based attribution method called XRAI that builds on Integrated Gradients. XRAI iteratively tests the importance of image segments, coalescing smaller regions into larger salient areas based on attribution scores. Through examples and results, the authors show XRAI produces higher quality attributions compared to existing methods.2. A perturbation-based sanity check that can be used to test the reliability of attribution methods. The authors find some popular methods like Gradients and Integrated Gradients can sometimes fail this sanity check.3. Two new metrics for empirically evaluating attribution methods called Accuracy Information Curves (AIC) and Softmax Information Curves (SIC). These measure model accuracy and softmax scores as a function of the information content in an image where salient regions are sequentially focused. The authors demonstrate these align with visual analysis and standard localization metrics.In summary, the main contributions are a new attribution method XRAI, a sanity check for testing attribution methods, and two new empirical evaluation metrics for comparing attribution techniques. Through experiments on ImageNet, the authors demonstrate XRAI produces improved attributions over existing approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new region-based attribution method called XRAI that improves on Integrated Gradients, introduces a perturbation-based sanity check to validate attribution methods, and proposes two new metrics called Accuracy Information Curves and Softmax Information Curves to empirically evaluate and compare the quality of different attribution methods on image datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several notable contributions to the field of interpreting and evaluating neural network models through attribution methods:- It introduces a new attribution method called XRAI that builds on Integrated Gradients, but generates attributions at the region level rather than pixel level. This helps address some reliability issues with pixel-level attributions.- It proposes a perturbation-based sanity check to help validate if an attribution method is properly assigning importance to input features that actually influence the model output. The authors find some popular methods like Gradients and Integrated Gradients can fail this sanity check.- It introduces two new quantitative evaluation methods called Accuracy Information Curves (AIC) and Softmax Information Curves (SIC) to compare attribution methods. These are inspired by gradually revealing important regions and measuring how model performance changes.- Through experiments on ImageNet, the paper shows XRAI produces better attributions than methods like Integrated Gradients, GradCAM, and simple gradients according to the proposed evaluation metrics and qualitative inspection.Some key related works in this field include:- Other region/segmentation-based attribution methods like Meaningful Perturbations (MP) [1] and Extremal Perturbations (EP) [2]. This paper demonstrates XRAI outperforming MP empirically.- Sanity checks proposed in [3] that aim to verify if a method produces meaningful attributions correlated with the model parameters. The perturbation sanity check here provides another way to validate methods.- Evaluation frameworks like Sensitivity-n [4] and metrics based on smallest sufficient regions [5]. The AIC/SIC evaluation is a new way to quantitatively compare methods.So in summary, this paper advances the field through its proposed attribution algorithm, sanity check, and evaluation methods. The experiments also provide one of the more extensive empirical comparisons between methods to date.[1] Fong, Fong, Vedaldi (2017)  [2] Fong, Vedaldi (2017)[3] Adebayo et al.
