# [Neural Scene Chronology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07970)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing time-varying 3D models of landmarks from Internet photos, with the goals of being able to render photo-realistic novel views with independent control of viewpoint, illumination, and time. The core hypotheses are:1. Different types of temporal changes in Internet photo collections, like illumination variation vs. changes to the underlying scene, are entangled together but need to be disentangled. 2. Scene-level changes tend to be discrete and sporadic over time rather than continuous.To address these challenges, the main technical contributions are:- A scene representation using a neural radiance field conditioned on per-image illumination embeddings and encoded time inputs. This disentangles illumination from scene changes.- A novel temporal encoding method based on step functions that can model abrupt, sporadic changes over time without overfitting to noise.So in summary, the paper aims to achieve high-quality view synthesis results for landmarks that change substantially over time, while disentangling different factors of variation like illumination and discrete scene changes. The core technical novelty is the step function encoding method for time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new method for chronology reconstruction, which aims to reconstruct a time-varying 3D model from internet photos of a landmark that has changed significantly over time. The model can render photo-realistic images with independent control of viewpoint, illumination, and time.2. It introduces a novel temporal encoding method based on step functions that can effectively model abrupt, sporadic scene content changes over time without overfitting to transient per-image factors like illumination.3. It collects a new dataset of four scenes with timestamped internet photos exhibiting various temporal changes, including billboards, graffiti art, and banners. This facilitates research on chronology reconstruction.4. Experiments demonstrate the method achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis results on the collected scenes and outperforms extensions of prior work. Detailed ablations validate the proposed step function encoding.In summary, the key contribution is a new neural scene representation and fitting procedure that can disentangle illumination and transient scene factors from longer-term content changes in internet photo collections. This enables high-quality rendering of scenes with independently controllable time and lighting. The step function encoding is critical to avoiding overfitting and enabling this disentanglement.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new 4D scene representation and temporal encoding method that can reconstruct photo-realistic time-varying 3D models from Internet photos, with independent control over viewpoint, time, and illumination.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents an innovative method for reconstructing time-varying 3D models from internet photos of large-scale landmarks. Here are some key ways it compares to other research in this field:- Most prior work focuses on reconstructing static 3D models from internet photos or video. This paper tackles the more challenging problem of modeling scenes with significant appearance changes over time.- The previous state-of-the-art method, Scene Chronology, could only reconstruct planar scene elements, limiting photo-realism. This paper achieves photo-realistic rendering of complex geometry.- This is the first method that can disentangle illumination variation and scene content changes and control them independently at render time. Other methods tend to blend content changes over time.- The proposed step function time encoding is novel and handles abrupt, sporadic scene changes better than alternatives like positional encoding.- The method scales to large outdoor scenes with complex geometry. Prior video-based techniques were limited to smaller scale indoor scenes. - A new dataset of internet photo collections with ground truth timestamps is introduced to benchmark chronology reconstruction.In summary, this paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art in modeling and rendering highly dynamic outdoor scenes in both quality and scalability. The novel time encoding technique is a key contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring how to simultaneously predict timestamps for internet photos that do not have timestamps, to allow them to be utilized for training the model. The current method relies on having accurate timestamps as input. - Handling scenes like Times Square that have billboards displaying videos (not just still images). The high frequency temporal changes in video content are difficult for the current method to reconstruct well, since it relies on support from other images in the collection.- Collecting datasets spanning more recent years, since Flickr has become less popular. The authors suggest considering other social platforms that may have more recent photos to expand the time range that can be modeled.- Extending the method to also allow dynamic geometry in addition to appearance changes, not just static geometry as currently assumed.- Generalizing the framework to handle other types of temporal changes beyond discrete/sporadic changes, like cyclical or progressive changes over time.- Exploring other potential applications of the step function encoding, which helps disentangle abrupt scene-level changes from transient image-level effects.So in summary, the main future directions are around expanding the types of input data and scenes that can be handled, generalizing the modeling of temporal changes, and further applications of the core encoding method proposed. Collecting more diverse datasets spanning longer time periods is also highlighted as an important direction to enable further progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper aims to reconstruct a time-varying 3D model of a landmark scene from Internet photos that can render photo-realistic images with controllable viewpoint, lighting, and time. The challenges are that different temporal changes like lighting and scene content are entangled in the photos, and scene content changes tend to be abrupt rather than continuous. To address this, the authors propose representing the scene as a 4D radiance field conditioned on per-image illumination codes to disentangle lighting changes. They introduce a novel temporal encoding method using learned step functions that can model abrupt, sporadic scene content changes over time. They collect a dataset of Internet photos of landmarks with temporal changes like billboards and graffiti art. Experiments demonstrate their method achieves better view synthesis quality and temporal stability than extensions of prior work, and allows controllable rendering of the scenes over time. The encoding method is analyzed through ablations. Limitations include reliance on accurate timestamps and inability to model high-frequency changes like videos.
