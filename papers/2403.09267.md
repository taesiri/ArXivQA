## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper explores the predictability of mid-price changes in the limit order book (LOB) for different stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange using deep learning models. 

The authors first collect high-quality LOB data for 15 liquid large- and mega-cap stocks from different sectors over 2017-2019. They classify these stocks into small-, medium- and large-tick stocks based on the relationship between the average bid-ask spread and tick size. Small-tick stocks have a spread much larger than the tick size, medium-tick stocks have a spread approximately 1.5-3 times the tick size, while large-tick stocks have a spread less than 1.5 times the tick size.

Several microstructural properties of the stocks are analyzed, including spread distribution, volume distribution at the best quotes, and spatial homogeneity of price levels in the LOB. The authors find distinct clustering behaviors for the different tick size groups. For instance, large-tick stocks have tighter spreads, higher volumes at the best quotes indicating greater liquidity, and more homogeneous price level structure in the LOB compared to small-tick stocks.

To forecast mid-price changes, the DeepLOB model, a convolutional-LSTM neural network, is utilized. The data is split into train, validation and test sets over the 3-year period. The model is tasked with predicting the direction of mid-price movements (up/down/stable) over 10, 50 and 100 LOB updates into the future. 

The forecasting accuracy is evaluated using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), which accounts for class imbalance. The authors find large-tick stocks consistently achieve higher MCC across all horizons compared to small- and medium-tick stocks, indicating greater predictability. The predictions also become more accurate at higher confidence threshold levels, at the expense of having less data.

Finally, the authors propose an innovative operational framework to evaluate the practical usefulness of the predictions for trading by estimating the probability of accurately forecasting complete transactions. The results demonstrate large-tick stocks provide the highest probability of correctly executing trades based on the predicted price movements.  

In conclusion, the paper provides strong evidence that microstructural properties have a significant influence on the efficacy of deep learning methods for LOB forecasting. The presented framework also allows assessing model predictions from a strategy-oriented perspective beyond just forecasting metrics.
