# [Self-Consistent Reasoning-based Aspect-Sentiment Quad Prediction with   Extract-Then-Assign Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00354)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict aspect term, opinion term, aspect category and sentiment polarity for a given input text. 
- Existing generative methods for ASQP suffer from imprecise predictions and limited interpretability due to data scarcity and inadequate modeling of the quadruplet composition process.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called Self-Consistent Reasoning-based Aspect-sentiment quad Prediction (SCRAP).
- SCRAP introduces an "Extract-Then-Assign" (ETA) reasoning strategy that first extracts aspect and opinion terms, then assigns category and polarity to each pair. This mimics human cognition.  
- SCRAP uses large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse ETA reasoning paths via chain-of-thought prompting.
- The model is trained to generate reasoning paths followed by quad predictions as targets. This helps capture reasoning-quad relationships.
- During inference, SCRAP samples multiple outputs and aggregates them via consistency voting to filter noise.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an interpretable ETA reasoning strategy for ASQP that mimics human cognition
- Integrates LLM-based diverse reasoning path generation via chain-of-thought prompting
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on ASQP benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods
- Reasoning process enhances model interpretability and helps diagnose prediction errors
- Consistency voting aggregates multiple outputs to improve prediction accuracy

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable extract-then-assign reasoning process for aspect sentiment quad prediction that leverages large language model capabilities and consistency voting to achieve superior performance. The reasoning-based approach also improves model interpretability.
