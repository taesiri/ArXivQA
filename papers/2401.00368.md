# [Improving Text Embeddings with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for learning text embeddings often rely on complex multi-stage training pipelines, limited labeled datasets, and small BERT-style encoder models. This leads to issues with engineering complexity, task/language coverage, and model capacity. 

Method:
- Propose a novel single-stage method using large language models (LLMs) and synthetic data generation.
- Use GPT-4 to generate diverse synthetic training data covering hundreds of thousands of text embedding tasks across 93 languages. 
- Fine-tune open-source LLMs like Mistral-7B on synthetic data using contrastive loss.
- Overall simpler pipeline without need for intermediate pre-training stages.

Results:
- When fine-tuned on synthetic data only, model achieves competitive results on BEIR and MTEB benchmarks without using any labeled data.
- When combined with a small amount of labeled data, establishes new SOTA results on BEIR and MTEB, significantly outperforming prior work.  
- Analysis shows pre-training is no longer needed for large LLMs. Model can also handle inputs >32k tokens.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art text embeddings can be learned with a simple single-stage framework leveraging recent advances in LLMs and synthetic data generation.
- Performance competitive with only synthetic data, sets new SOTA results when combined with labels.
- Reduces complexity compared to prior multi-stage approaches that depend on pre-training and limited labeled data.
