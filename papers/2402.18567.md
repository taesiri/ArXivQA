# [Diffusion Language Models Are Versatile Protein Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current protein language models (LMs) have limitations in either their generative capabilities (for masked LMs like ESM) or their representational power (for autoregressive LMs like ProGen). The key requirements for a versatile protein LM that combines both strengths are (1) a strong and scalable generative modeling framework to capture the distribution of massive protein sequences, and (2) a bidirectional context to better model global interactions between amino acids. Continuous diffusion models meet these criteria but struggle with modeling discrete sequence data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel Diffusion Protein Language Model (DPLM) based on a discrete diffusion probabilistic framework that serves as a principled generalization of language modeling to proteins. DPLM is pretrained on evolutionary-scale protein sequences via a self-supervised denoising objective that requires reconstructing the native sequence from varied levels of masking noise. This enables DPLM to capture complex dependencies in amino acid sequences.

Main Contributions:

(1) DPLM combines the scalability of language models and the strong generative capability of diffusion models, serving as a versatile biological foundation model for both generative and predictive tasks.

(2) DPLM generates highly structurally plausible, novel and diverse protein sequences, suggesting it well captures the distribution of protein sequences.

(3) As a superior representation learner, fine-tuned DPLM outperforms models like ESM-2 on various downstream predictive tasks, owing to its better understanding of proteins from the generative pretraining.

(4) DPLM supports various conditioning strategies for conditional generation: (a) on partial sequences, (b) on other modalities like structure, and (c) plug-and-play controllable generation via classifier guidance.

In summary, the proposed discrete diffusion protein LM unifies generative and predictive modeling of proteins in one framework and demonstrates strong capabilities on both fronts. The scaling laws hold for further improvements with larger DPLM variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Diffusion Protein Language Model (DPLM), a versatile protein language model that combines the scalability and expressiveness of language models with the strong generative capabilities of diffusion models, demonstrating impressive performance on both unconditional and conditional protein sequence generation as well as on a variety of downstream predictive tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing DPLM, a versatile protein language model under discrete diffusion framework, pre-trained on evolutionary-scale protein sequences. DPLM combines the strengths of language models (scalability and expressiveness) and diffusion models (strong generative capabilities).

2. Demonstrating that DPLM can generate highly structurally plausible, novel and diverse protein sequences. This suggests DPLM has learned to capture the distribution of proteins well. 

3. Showing that DPLM serves as a superior representation learner for various downstream predictive tasks, outperforming models like ESM-2. This indicates DPLM better understands proteins thanks to its generative pre-training.

4. Developing several conditioning strategies to enable conditional generation with DPLM for various needs: (a) conditioning on partial sequences; (b) incorporating other modalities as conditions through adapter tuning; (c) plug-and-play controllable generation by integrating classifier guidance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DPLM, a versatile protein language model with strong generative and predictive capabilities, and demonstrating its prowess on both unconditional and conditional tasks through extensive experiments. The discrete diffusion pre-training is key to making DPLM a versatile foundation model for protein research.
