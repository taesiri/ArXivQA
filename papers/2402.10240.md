# [A Dynamical View of the Question of Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the fundamental philosophical question of discovering causal relationships from raw observational data, especially in complex dynamical systems like robotics, games, economics, medicine, etc. Existing approaches to causality rely on causal graphs or structural equations and interventions, which have limitations - they require extensive domain knowledge, are restricted to static settings, and interventions are often infeasible. The paper argues for a process-based view of causality that examines underlying dynamics over time.  

Solution:
The paper presents a formal theory and computational framework to establish causation between events directly from temporal data without interventions. Key ideas:

- Define events as changes in state/actions over time intervals 
- Introduce "grit" - minimum probability of effect event happening from current state
- Present "Value Lemma": Grit can be computed via reinforcement learning of a value function  
- Provide "Decomposition Lemma": Decompose grit change into contributions of individual state components  
- Formalize causation based on grit change and component contributions 
- Convert to computational methods like g-formula to implement over data

Contributions:  
- New formalized definition of causation based on process theory avoiding interventions
- Fundamental lemmas to reduce causality to reinforcement learning problems
- Ability to compute causal contributions of components from raw data
- Handle causal discovery in complex dynamical systems like robotics, games, medicine etc.
- Experiments on Atari games and medical time series data demonstrate discovering and quantifying causal relationships

The theory enables answering causal questions on why certain events happened from sheer examination of dynamics and learning, without requiring system knowledge or interventions. This moves towards the age-old vision of understanding causality from observational data.
