# [ViTGaze: Gaze Following with Interaction Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ViTGaze: Gaze Following with Interaction Features in Vision Transformers":

Problem:
Gaze following aims to predict where a person is looking in an image, which is useful for human-computer interaction and neuroscience. Existing methods either use multi-modal inputs (e.g. depth, pose) in a two-stage pipeline, or complex decoders with object detections. Both have limitations - multi-modal methods depend on the quality of the first stage, while complex decoders increase model complexity. This paper explores designing a concise single-modal gaze following method using only RGB images.

Method: 
The key idea is that self-attention in Transformers can capture interactions between image patches, which can be transferred to model human-scene interactions for gaze following. Thus, the authors propose ViTGaze - a framework with three components:

1) Multi-level 4D Interaction Encoder: Extracts inter-patch interaction features from the self-attention maps of a pre-trained Vision Transformer at multiple layers and heads. This results in a 4D interaction representation.

2) 2D Spatial Guidance Module: Determines spatial importance weights for each image patch based on the person's head location, to guide aggregation of interaction features.

3) Prediction Heads: Use the aggregated features to predict a gaze heatmap and whether the gaze is inside or outside the image.

Overall ViTGaze focuses on encoding interactions, with a very simple decoder taking up <1% of parameters.

Contributions:
- Proposes a new single-RGB image framework for gaze following based entirely on a pre-trained Vision Transformer encoder and attention maps.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance among single modal methods, and comparable performance to multi-modal techniques, while using 59% fewer parameters.

- Demonstrates the efficacy of modelling human-scene interactions via self-attention in Transformers for the task of gaze following.

In summary, the paper presents ViTGaze, a new high-performance and lightweight gaze following method using only RGB images, by transferring self-attention interactions in Vision Transformers to model human-scene interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes ViTGaze, a single-modality gaze following framework built upon pre-trained vision transformers that achieves state-of-the-art performance by modeling human-scene interactions extracted from transformer self-attention maps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes ViTGaze, a single-modality encoder-only gaze following framework based on pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first gaze following method entirely built upon the pre-training of ViTs, with over 99% of parameters coming from the ViT encoder.

2. It demonstrates the feasibility of extracting human-scene interaction information from the inter-token interactions in the self-attention maps of ViTs. It designs a 4D interaction module guided by a 2D spatial guidance module for this purpose.

3. It evaluates ViTGaze on two major gaze following benchmarks, GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget, achieving state-of-the-art performance among single-modality methods and comparable results to multi-modality methods with 59% fewer parameters.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and efficient gaze following framework based solely on pre-trained Vision Transformers, outperforming prior single-modality approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Gaze following - The main task that the paper focuses on, which is predicting where a person is looking in an image.

- Vision transformers (ViTs) - The paper proposes using a pre-trained plain vision transformer as the basis for the gaze following model.

- Self-attention - The self-attention mechanism in transformers is used to extract 4D interaction features that capture relationships between image patches. 

- Multi-level 4D interaction features - The paper extracts interaction features from multiple layers and heads of the ViT self-attention to capture interactions at different spatial scales.

- 2D spatial guidance - A module that determines spatial weights to aggregate the multi-level 4D features into person-specific interaction features.  

- Single-modality - The proposed method only relies on RGB images as input, unlike many previous multi-modal gaze following techniques.

- Encoder-based - The decoder of the model accounts for less than 1% of parameters, so the method is based almost entirely on the pre-trained ViT encoder.

- State-of-the-art performance - The method achieves top results for single-modality gaze following on two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the key ideas have to do with leveraging a pre-trained vision transformer in a new way to effectively perform gaze following with just RGB image input.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes that the inter-token interactions within self-attention can be transferred to interactions between humans and scenes. Can you elaborate more on why this presumption makes sense and how it is utilized in the proposed framework?

2. The 4D interaction encoder extracts features from multiple transformer layers as well as multiple attention heads. What is the motivation behind using features from different layers and heads? How do they complement each other?  

3. The 2D spatial guidance module is used to guide the aggregation of 4D interaction features. Why is this guidance necessary? What problems may arise if the features are aggregated naively without guidance?

4. An auxiliary head is introduced in the 2D spatial guidance module for predicting whether a patch overlaps with a person's head. What role does this auxiliary head play? How does it benefit the training?

5. The paper shows that self-supervised pre-trained vision transformers perform better than supervised pretrained ones on this task. Why do you think self-supervision helps more in modeling interactions compared to supervision on ImageNet labels?

6. One highlight of the method is the very lightweight decoder design. How does the proposed encoder-focused architecture differ fundamentally from previous decoder-focused architectures for this task?

7. The loss function consists of three terms - gaze heatmap loss, gaze in-out loss and auxiliary head loss. Why is the auxiliary head loss necessary if its target is already implicitly optimized in the aggregation using guidance?  

8. How does the proposed unbiased data processing strategy for generating ground truth heatmaps qualitatively differ from the traditional quantization approach? Why can it improve performance?

9. The visualization shows differences in local vs global interactions captured by lower vs higher transformer layers. How can we determine the optimal combination and integration of features from different layers?

10. The paper compares with multi-modality methods that use depth, temporal signals etc. Do you think incorporating such extra modalities can provide further gains in the proposed framework? How can they be effectively integrated?
