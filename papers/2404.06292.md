# [nEMO: Dataset of Emotional Speech in Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speech emotion recognition is important for applications like healthcare, customer service, and personalization of dialogue systems. However, there is a lack of emotional speech datasets, especially for Slavic languages like Polish.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents nEMO, a new emotional speech corpus for Polish containing over 3 hours of audio samples with portrayals of 6 emotions by 9 actors. The dataset uses a simulated approach with selected linguistic content representing Polish phonetics.

Methodology: 
- Emotions included: anger, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, neutral
- 90 sentences containing uncommon Polish phonemes were created 
- 9 actors (4 female, 5 male) aged 20-30 recorded the sentences portraying each emotion  
- 3 actors were voice professionals, 6 were amateurs 
- Home recording setup used high quality microphone

Dataset Details:
- Final dataset has 4,481 samples after human evaluation to ensure emotion authenticity
- Distribution of emotions provided
- Audio, emotion labels, speaker metadata, original and normalized transcriptions of sentences included
- Freely available under Creative Commons license 

Evaluation:
- Classifiers tested: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- MFCC features extracted from recordings used as input
- Random forest achieved best accuracy of 83.95% in classifying emotions

Conclusions:
- Satisfactory classifier performance proves dataset effectively captures nuances of Polish emotional speech
- Important resource for speech emotion recognition in Polish and other Slavic languages
- Will be publicly shared to enable future research
