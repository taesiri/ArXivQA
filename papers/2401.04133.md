# [SynHIN: Generating Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network for   Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04133)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of public heterogeneous graph datasets, which hinders graph neural network (GNN) research progress. This scarcity is especially pronounced for datasets with ground truth explanations to assess GNN interpretability methods.
- Existing synthetic graph generation methods have limitations such as focusing only on homogeneous graphs, lacking explanatory ground truths, limited diversity in primary motifs, and significant human involvement.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SynHIN, a novel method to automatically generate synthetic heterogeneous graph datasets that mimic real-world graph characteristics. 
- It identifies primary motifs from real datasets to serve as ground truth explanations. These motifs are used to create subgraphs, which are merged iteratively into clusters and then into a full heterogeneous graph.
- Two merge techniques are introduced - In-Cluster Merge to combine subgraphs of the same label, and Out-Cluster Merge to connect different clusters.
- Pruning is used to conform the synthetic graph to constraints of the real dataset. Node features are also generated to match distributions.

Main Contributions:
- First work to create synthetic heterogeneous graphs with explanatory ground truths, providing benchmark datasets for heterogeneous GNN explanation methods.
- Addresses lack of public heterogeneous graphs and ground truths to assess interpretability.
- Multiple modules enable customization to different real-world graph datasets. Merge techniques better emulate connections of heterogeneous networks.
- Experiments demonstrate SynHIN can generate varied graphs and the primary motifs serve as explanations well per fidelity metrics.
- Adaptability is shown on ACM and DBLP datasets. Benchmark facilitates future research on explainable AI for heterogeneous graphs.

In summary, SynHIN automates the generation of heterogeneous graph datasets with explanatory ground truths to enable research on interpretable heterogeneous GNNs, overcoming limitations of prior synthetic graph generation approaches.
