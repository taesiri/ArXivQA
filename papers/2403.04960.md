# [SecGPT: An Execution Isolation Architecture for LLM-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being extended into systems that support third-party applications (apps). These apps interact through natural language interfaces, are given access to user data, and can freely collaborate with each other.
- However, the imprecise nature of natural language interfaces and the lack of isolation between apps poses serious security and privacy risks for users. Malicious apps could exfiltrate user data or alter system behavior.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes \llmsys, an architecture for LLM-based systems that aims to secure the execution of third-party apps through isolation. 
- The key idea is to isolate app execution and mediate their interactions outside of isolation environments through well-defined interfaces. This reduces the attack surface.
- \llmsys consists of a central module called the hub that routes user queries to apps running in isolated environments called spokes. Spokes get dedicated LLMs and memory.
- An inter-spoke communication (ISC) protocol allows spokes to collaborate safely via the hub. The hub screens messages between spokes.

Main Contributions:
- An execution isolation architecture for securing LLM-based systems that support third-party apps. Apps run isolated in spokes and interactions are mediated.
- An implementation of the architecture called \llmsys that demonstrates effectiveness in protecting against attacks while providing the same functionality as non-isolated systems.
- Evaluation shows \llmsys protects against case study attacks that compromise apps, steal data, alter system behavior due to language ambiguity.
- Performance overhead of \llmsys is <0.3x for 75\% of queries compared to a non-isolated baseline system.
