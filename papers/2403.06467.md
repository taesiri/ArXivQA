# [Point Mamba: A Novel Point Cloud Backbone Based on State Space Model   with Octree-Based Ordering Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Point clouds are fundamental 3D representations for many applications like autonomous driving and robotic vision. However, the intrinsic disorder and irregularity of point clouds make it challenging to process them effectively with deep learning methods. Previous methods are mainly based on CNN or transformer backbones. CNN has limited receptive fields while transformer has quadratic complexity. 

Proposed Method:
This paper proposes Point Mamba, a novel backbone for point cloud processing based on the state space model (SSM). To enable SSM for the non-causal point cloud data, the authors design an octree-based ordering scheme to globally sort the points into a z-order sequence that retains spatial proximity. This establishes a causal relationship for SSM while keeping geometric information. 

Specifically, the points are embedded and fed into a series of Point Mamba Blocks, which leverage a bidirectional selective scanning mechanism of SSM to capture both short and long-range dependencies. Residual connections and feature propagation layers are used to obtain hierarchical point features. The features are finally utilized for classification and segmentation tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Propose Point Mamba, the first SSM-based backbone tailored for point cloud tasks. An octree-based ordering is introduced to enable causality.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet40 classification (93.4%) and ScanNet segmentation (75.7% mIoU). 
- Demonstrate superior parameter and GPU efficiency over transformer methods, with linear complexity in computation.

In summary, Point Mamba explores the potential of SSM for point cloud processing with novel ordering designs. Experiments show its effectiveness and efficiency. This helps advance point cloud understanding research.
