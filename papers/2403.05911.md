# [Towards Optimizing Human-Centric Objectives in AI-Assisted   Decision-Making With Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05911)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-assisted decision-making systems typically only aim to optimize for decision accuracy. However, there are other important human-centric objectives that should be considered, such as improving human learning/skills and enjoyment of the task.  
- Providing the same type of AI support (e.g. recommendations + explanations) regardless of context/objectives can lead to issues like over-reliance on AI. Adaptive support is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and use offline reinforcement learning to learn policies that provide adaptive AI support to optimize different objectives.
- Instantiate the approach for two objectives - maximizing immediate decision accuracy and maximizing human learning about the task. 
- Design state space to capture relevant factors like AI uncertainty, human knowledge/competence, need for cognition (NFC).
- Design action space with four types of AI support, including recommendation + explanation, explanation only, on-demand support.
- Learn policies from previously collected interaction dataset. Evaluate via computational analysis and two human studies.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate promise of using offline RL to model human-AI decision making and provide adaptive support for optimizing different objectives.
- Show that accuracy is easier to optimize than human learning. Highlight need for better explanations/interactions.  
- Discover insights like: low NFC participants rarely view on-demand AI suggestions.
- Show over-reliance can occur even with support types that improve learning, challenging assumptions.
- Underscore the importance of considering objectives beyond just accuracy in human-AI collaboration.

In summary, the paper illustrates how offline RL can be used to provide adaptive human-centric AI support and makes both methodological and empirical contributions around optimizing objectives like accuracy and learning in AI-assisted decision making.
