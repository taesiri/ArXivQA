# [Data is Overrated: Perceptual Metrics Can Lead Learning in the Absence   of Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03455)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper demonstrates that perceptual metrics designed to match human perceptual judgments can be effectively used as training objectives for machine learning models, even in the absence of natural training data. The authors train convolutional autoencoders to reconstruct uniform random noise using either a standard MSE loss or perceptual losses based on structural similarity (SSIM) and normalized Laplacian pyramid distance (NLPD). At test time, they find that models trained with perceptual losses generalize better to reconstructing mel-spectrograms of music audio and have reduced perceptual artifacts, despite never having seen natural signals during training. This shows that perceptual metrics inherently capture structural information about natural signals and can guide models to learn better representations, without needing large datasets. The results motivate further research into training generative models directly with perceptual losses to improve output quality and evaluate model performance.
