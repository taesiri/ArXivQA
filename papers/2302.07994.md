# [À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT): Combining Distinct Data Via Composable   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07994)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently build models that can be customized for each user based on their individual data access rights and preferences. 

Specifically, the paper aims to tackle three key challenges concurrently:

1) Updating models with new data in an efficient way, without having to retrain from scratch.

2) Allowing different subsets of the training data to be used by different users (compartmentalization). 

3) Allowing users to customize the data used by their models (model customization).

The paper refers to this as the "\`a-la-carte learning" problem, where users can specify custom subsets of available data to serve their specific needs. The key hypothesis is that this can be achieved efficiently using their proposed method of "À-la-carte Prompt Tuning" (APT).

So in summary, the central research question is how to enable efficient and customizable model training and serving based on arbitrary user-selected data subsets, which they address through the APT approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT) to enable efficient à-la-carte learning. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Introducing the à-la-carte learning problem to concurrently address challenges like continual learning, machine unlearning, and model customization.

2. Proposing APT, which converts datasets into prompts that can be composed at inference time. APT uses a modified attention mechanism to prevent interference between prompts. 

3. Demonstrating that APT achieves accuracy within 5% of models trained on the full data, even when individual prompts use far less data. 

4. Showing that APT with a prompt weighting scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on continual learning benchmarks like Split CIFAR-100 and CORe50.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing APT as an efficient and customizable solution to the à-la-carte learning problem, with strong empirical results on tasks like forgetting, continual learning, and model customization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method called À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT) to construct customized vision models by composing prompts trained separately on different data sources, enabling applications like continual learning, machine unlearning, and model customization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces the concept of "à-la-carte learning", which aims to address several challenges with using large neural network models commercially, including efficiently updating models with new data, allowing custom subsets of data per user, and enabling data removal requests. The key idea is to train individual "prompts" on separate data shards which can then be composed at inference time to construct custom models based on a user's data access rights. 

The proposed APT (À-la-carte Prompt Tuning) method builds on recent work in vision prompt tuning, which adapts pretrained vision transformers to downstream tasks through learned prompt tokens. However, this paper shows that simply concatenating independently trained prompts leads to poor performance, and introduces structured attention to enable effective prompt composition.

Compared to related work in continual learning, forgetting, and model adaptation, this work is novel in tackling all these challenges concurrently within a single framework. The composability of prompts provides inherent benefits for compartmentalization, customization, and satisfying data removal requests. 

The most related works are DyTox for class incremental learning, and Rishabh et al. on machine unlearning which also train models on data shards. However, APT is shown to outperform these approaches while being far more parameter and computationally efficient. The compositional prompt design uniquely enables constructing custom models on-the-fly for each user.

In summary, this work introduces a new learning paradigm to address key challenges in deploying models commercially, with a practical algorithm that advances the state of the art on tasks like continual and incremental learning. The composable prompting approach is a novel way to reconcile customizability, privacy, and performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising future research directions:

1. They highlight that while APT offers one solution to the à-la-carte learning problem, the problem is more general and deserves further study. Developing additional competitive machine learning methods that respect users' data usage and privacy rights is an important direction.

2. Integrating à-la-carte learning with federated learning could be an interesting research avenue. Since federated learning trains a single centralized model via gradient aggregation, it does not fully solve the à-la-carte learning desiderata. Combining insights from the two approaches could lead to useful hybrid techniques.

3. While they demonstrate APT for image classification, exploring its effectiveness for other modalities like text and speech could be impactful. The composability of prompts may lend itself well to multimodal learning across diverse datasets and users.

4. The prompts in APT are fixed after training, but learning to dynamically compose prompts at inference time based on the input sample could improve performance. Exploring meta-learned or reinforcement learning-based prompt composition mechanisms is suggested.

5. Evaluating the robustness of APT models against various threats and attacks would help ensure the privacy and security promises of à-la-carte learning hold in practice. Adversarial attacks tailored to prompts may require new defenses.

6. Deploying à-la-carte learning in real-world applications could reveal new challenges and requirements. Building prototypes for commercial systems using à-la-carte learning and studying what issues arise in practice is highlighted as an important direction.

In summary, the key themes for future work are broadening the applicability of à-la-carte learning, hybridizing it with complementary approaches like federated learning, dynamically composing prompts, ensuring robustness, and real-world piloting and deployment of the paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of À-la-carte Learning, where a model can be assembled at inference time from a menu of distinct data sources based on a user's preferences and access rights. The authors propose À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT) to enable this capability efficiently. APT works by converting each data source into a small learned prompt, which can be composed together at test time along with the input to form predictions. A key contribution is a structured attention mechanism that allows combining prompts while preventing interference between them. Experiments demonstrate APT can achieve accuracy comparable to training on the combined data at a fraction of the cost. APT also achieves state-of-the-art results on continual learning benchmarks, while providing benefits like compartmentalization and the ability to add/remove data sources easily. Overall, the paper presents APT as an efficient and customizable solution for situations where users have varying or evolving data access rights.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the problem of à-la-carte learning, where a model can be customized for each user based on their individual data access rights and preferences. The goal is to build a model that can evolve as new data becomes available without needing to retrain from scratch, while also respecting data removal requests and allowing different users to use custom subsets of the data. To enable this, the authors propose à-la-carte prompt tuning (APT). APT converts each data source into a learned prompt which contains information only about that source. At inference time, prompts can be arbitrarily combined to construct bespoke models for each user. A key contribution is a structured attention mechanism that allows combining independently trained prompts without destructive interference. Experiments demonstrate APT achieves accuracy comparable to training on the combined data sources, while enabling efficient model versioning, forgetting, and continual learning. On class and domain incremental learning benchmarks, APT with a prompt weighting scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In summary, this paper introduces the à-la-carte learning problem to concurrently address challenges like continual learning and model customization. The proposed APT method leverages prompt tuning and structured attention to efficiently construct customizable models from independent prompt components. Experiments validate APT can match performance of models trained on combined data at a fraction of the cost, with state-of-the-art results on incremental learning benchmarks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT) to enable efficient à-la-carte learning. APT leverages vision transformers and prompt tuning. It converts each dataset into a learned prompt, transforming the data pool into a prompt pool. At inference time, given a subset of data sources to use, APT retrieves the corresponding prompts and concatenates them with the input. APT uses a modified attention mechanism that prevents interference between prompts and ensembles the individual outputs. This allows combining prompts trained separately while avoiding destructive interference. The prompts provide comparably accurate predictions to a model trained jointly on their union, while being efficient in training and inference. APT thus enables constructing customized models per user based on their data access rights. It also enables capabilities like continual learning, machine unlearning, and model versioning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing several key challenges that arise when deploying large neural network models in commercial applications:

-Updating models with new data can be prohibitively expensive, even when training time is not an issue. Maintaining previous model versions is important to avoid disrupting downstream workflows.  

-Owners of training data may change sharing preferences at any time. This can lead to datasets shrinking over time (machine unlearning) or different subsets of data being usable by different users (compartmentalization).

-Users may want to use custom subsets of data to better tailor models to their specific use cases (model customization). 

The paper refers to the problem of building a model that can handle these issues concurrently as "à-la-carte learning". The key requirements are:

1) Users specify a custom subset of training data at inference time. 

2) The model output depends only on the user's specified data sources.

3) Model evolution and customization should be efficient without prohibitively expensive retraining.

So in summary, the paper aims to enable efficient "à-la-carte learning" to concurrently address challenges like continual learning, machine unlearning, and model customization for commercial model deployment.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces À-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT), a method that allows composing distinct vision transformer prompts trained on different data sources into a single model. APT converts each dataset into a separate prompt which can be trained in isolation. At inference time, the relevant prompts are concatenated together and fed into the model. A modified attention mechanism prevents interference between prompts and allows scaling to large prompt pools. This enables `a-la-carte learning' where users can select arbitrary subsets of available data sources to construct customized models. Experiments show APT achieves accuracy within 5% of models trained on the combined data, significantly outperforming ensembling prompts naively. APT requires lower training and inference cost than ensembling full models. For continual learning benchmarks like Split CIFAR-100 and CORe50, APT achieves state-of-the-art results. The composability and customizability of APT makes it appealing for decentralized learning, model versioning, forgetting, and other applications requiring flexible access to distinct data sources.
