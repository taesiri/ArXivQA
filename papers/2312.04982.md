# [Boosting Prompt-Based Self-Training With Mapping-Free Automatic   Verbalizer for Multi-Class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04982)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel trainable verbalizer called Mapping-free Automatic Verbalizer (MAV) to enhance prompt-based self-training for multi-class text classification. Unlike previous verbalizers that use limited information from masked language model (MLM) predictions and require manual selection of label words, MAV leverages all available information from MLM predictions to automatically identify useful vocabulary features for distinguishing between classes. MAV consists of two fully connected layers that extract and map key tokens from the MLM prediction vector to the label space, eliminating the need for costly label engineering. Experiments on five multi-class datasets demonstrate that prompt-based self-training with MAV achieves superior performance over baselines, with an average improvement of 12.8\% in self-training efficacy. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of MAV's learned representations indicate its effectiveness in aggregating vocabulary features in a class-discriminative manner for multi-class classification. Overall, the proposed methodology maximizes the benefits of prompt-based self-training without any verbalizer manipulation, highlighted by strong empirical results across diverse multi-class datasets.
