# [Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast for Self-supervised   Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11261)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central hypothesis of this paper is that decomposing the video representation learning task into hierarchical subtasks that emphasize spatial vs temporal features will result in better learned representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods that learn spatial and temporal features entangled together. Specifically, the authors propose a method called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) that:1) Decouples the learning objective into Spatial Contrast and Temporal Contrast subtasks to focus on spatial and temporal features separately.2) Performs the learning hierarchically across multiple scales to capture multi-scale spatial and temporal semantics. The authors hypothesize that by decomposing the problem and learning spatial vs temporal features separately in a hierarchical manner, HDC will be better able to learn rich video representations compared to traditional contrastive learning approaches that learn entangled spatial-temporal features in one shot. The experiments aim to validate whether HDC does indeed outperform other methods on downstream action recognition tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It demonstrates the effectiveness of spatial-temporal feature learning decoupling and hierarchical learning for self-supervised video representation learning. - It shows that augmentations can be manipulated as regularization to guide neural networks to learn desired features in contrastive learning. The paper introduces a new way to separately capture spatial and temporal semantics in videos through this approach.- It proposes an approach to improve hierarchical contrastive learning by modeling the divergent levels of invariance in different layers and using that to weight the loss terms. - It presents a method called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) that outperforms other unsupervised methods on downstream action recognition tasks on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.In summary, the key ideas are using regularization through augmented data to decouple the learning of spatial and temporal features, performing this decoupled learning hierarchically across network layers, and weighting the loss terms appropriately to account for differences in invariance across layers. The combination of these ideas leads to state-of-the-art performance on standard video representation learning benchmarks.
