# [Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast for Self-supervised   Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11261)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central hypothesis of this paper is that decomposing the video representation learning task into hierarchical subtasks that emphasize spatial vs temporal features will result in better learned representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods that learn spatial and temporal features entangled together. 

Specifically, the authors propose a method called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) that:

1) Decouples the learning objective into Spatial Contrast and Temporal Contrast subtasks to focus on spatial and temporal features separately.

2) Performs the learning hierarchically across multiple scales to capture multi-scale spatial and temporal semantics. 

The authors hypothesize that by decomposing the problem and learning spatial vs temporal features separately in a hierarchical manner, HDC will be better able to learn rich video representations compared to traditional contrastive learning approaches that learn entangled spatial-temporal features in one shot. The experiments aim to validate whether HDC does indeed outperform other methods on downstream action recognition tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It demonstrates the effectiveness of spatial-temporal feature learning decoupling and hierarchical learning for self-supervised video representation learning. 

- It shows that augmentations can be manipulated as regularization to guide neural networks to learn desired features in contrastive learning. The paper introduces a new way to separately capture spatial and temporal semantics in videos through this approach.

- It proposes an approach to improve hierarchical contrastive learning by modeling the divergent levels of invariance in different layers and using that to weight the loss terms. 

- It presents a method called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) that outperforms other unsupervised methods on downstream action recognition tasks on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.

In summary, the key ideas are using regularization through augmented data to decouple the learning of spatial and temporal features, performing this decoupled learning hierarchically across network layers, and weighting the loss terms appropriately to account for differences in invariance across layers. The combination of these ideas leads to state-of-the-art performance on standard video representation learning benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new approach for self-supervised video representation learning called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) which decomposes the learning objective into separate subtasks emphasizing spatial and temporal features performed hierarchically to capture rich semantics at multiple scales, achieving state-of-the-art performance on action recognition benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in self-supervised video representation learning:

- The paper introduces a novel framework called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) that decomposes the learning objective into separate subtasks emphasizing spatial and temporal features. Most prior work has focused on learning spatio-temporal features together rather than explicitly decoupling them. The decoupling is a novel idea proposed in this paper.

- The paper also proposes performing the learning hierarchically, capturing features at multiple scales. While some recent work like Yang et al. 2020 also explores hierarchical contrastive learning, this paper applies the idea to spatial-temporal decoupled learning for the first time. 

- The paper shows that augmentations can be manipulated as regularization to guide the network to learn desired semantics in contrastive learning. They introduce a specific way to use augmentations to separately capture spatial and temporal features. This idea of using augmentations for decoupling has not been explored before.

- The paper models the divergent levels of invariance in different layers as different loss weights to improve hierarchical contrastive learning. This is a new approach not present in other hierarchical contrastive learning papers. 

- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance of HDC over other self-supervised methods on downstream action recognition tasks on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks. The gains over directly learning spatio-temporal features together demonstrate the benefits of the proposed decoupling and hierarchical learning.

In summary, the key novelties compared to prior work are the introduction of spatial-temporal decoupling, using augmentations for regularization to enable decoupled learning, hierarchical multi-scale learning applied to the decoupled objectives, and modeling layer invariances - leading to improved performance over prior arts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other ways to manipulate augmentations as regularization to guide networks to learn different semantics. They showed the potential of this idea for decoupling spatial and temporal features, but there may be other semantics that could be disentangled in a similar way.

- Developing better ways to model the significance or invariance at different hierarchical levels. The authors used simple weighting schemes here, but more principled approaches could be developed.

- Applying the ideas of hierarchical decoupled learning to other self-supervised tasks beyond contrastive learning. The authors focused on contrastive learning in this work, but the core ideas could potentially benefit other pretext tasks as well.

- Exploring the impact of different encoders/backbones and more advanced architectures. The results showed benefits from using more advanced backbones, indicating room for further improvements.

- Evaluating the learned representations on additional downstream tasks beyond action recognition. Generality to other video understanding tasks would further demonstrate the usefulness.

- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised methods that incorporate both RGB and optical flow inputs. Adding flow could potentially capture more motion semantics.

- Combining hierarchical decoupled learning with other recent advances like memory banks or momentum encoders. Integrating successful techniques could lead to further gains.

In summary, the core ideas of manipulation of augmentations and hierarchical decoupled learning seem promising for future exploration, both within contrastive learning and potentially beyond. Evaluating on more tasks and integrating with other advances could also be interesting directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel technique called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) for self-supervised video representation learning. HDC decomposes the learning objective into two contrastive subtasks that respectively emphasize spatial and temporal features, and performs the learning hierarchically to capture multi-scale semantics. The spatial and temporal decoupling is achieved by manipulating augmentations to provide shortcuts that guide the network to focus on spatial or temporal features. HDC performs the contrastive learning at multiple hierarchies modeled with different loss weights to account for varying invariance levels across layers. Experiments on action recognition and nearest neighbor retrieval using various backbones show state-of-the-art performance of HDC on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks. The results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed spatial-temporal decoupling, hierarchical learning, and modeling significance of invariance, as well as the potential for further improvement with more advanced architectures.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel technique for self-supervised video representation learning called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC). HDC decomposes the learning objective into two separate subtasks: Spatial Contrast and Temporal Contrast. It then performs learning hierarchically across multiple scales. The key ideas are: 1) Decouple spatial and temporal feature learning into separate subtasks with different augmentations to guide the model to learn desired semantics. 2) Perform the subtasks hierarchically across layers to capture multi-scale features. 3) Model the significance of instance-level invariance at different scales as loss weights to overcome divergent invariance levels across hierarchies. 

Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of HDC on downstream action recognition and nearest neighbor retrieval tasks on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks, using C3D, 3D-ResNet18 and R(2+1)D-10 backbones. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed techniques of decoupled contrast learning, hierarchical learning, and modeling significance of invariance across scales. The results suggest that manipulating augmentations as regularization can guide the model to learn desired spatial vs temporal features, and performing learning hierarchically can capture richer multi-scale semantics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel technique for self-supervised video representation learning called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC). The key ideas are: (1) decouple the learning objective into two contrastive subtasks that respectively emphasize spatial and temporal features, and (2) perform the learning hierarchically across multiple scales. For the decoupling, spatial augmentations are used to provide a shortcut for the Spatial Contrast subtask to focus on spatial features, while temporal cropping plus spatial augmentations encourage the Temporal Contrast subtask to rely more on temporal features. For the hierarchical learning, features from multiple layers are pooled to produce multi-scale embeddings, with two strategies: 3D pooling for Temporal Contrast across clips and 2D pooling for Spatial Contrast within clips. The overall method is trained end-to-end on a compound loss that combines the spatial and temporal contrastive losses across scales. Experiments on action recognition and nearest neighbor retrieval demonstrate the benefits of the proposed spatial-temporal decoupling and hierarchical learning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of unsupervised video representation learning. Specifically, it aims to learn good video representations without relying on manual annotations, so that the learned features can be used to initialize models for downstream tasks like action recognition. 

The key question it tries to tackle is how to design an effective pretext task for self-supervised contrastive learning that is able to capture both rich spatial and temporal semantics from videos at multiple scales. Traditional contrastive learning methods often learn highly entangled spatial-temporal features that may lead to memorization rather than understanding. 

The paper proposes a new approach called Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) to address this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Decouple the learning objective into separate subtasks of Spatial Contrast and Temporal Contrast that emphasize spatial and temporal features respectively.

2) Perform the learning hierarchically at multiple scales to capture multi-scale semantics. 

3) Guide the network to learn desired spatial or temporal features by manipulating augmentations as regularization.

4) Model the divergent levels of invariance in different layers and re-weight the objectives accordingly.

Through this hierarchical decoupling and careful regularization, HDC is able to learn more generalized and disentangled spatial-temporal video representations in a self-supervised manner.
