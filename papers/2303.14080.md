# [Best of Both Worlds: Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Tabular and   Imaging Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14080)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How can we develop an effective self-supervised contrastive learning framework that leverages both tabular data and images to learn useful representations? 

Specifically, the paper proposes a multimodal contrastive learning approach that combines tabular data (such as clinical measurements, questionnaire responses, etc.) and images (such as MRI scans) to pretrain encoders in a self-supervised manner. The key ideas and contributions are:

- This is the first work to propose a contrastive self-supervised framework that jointly leverages both tabular and image data. Prior contrastive learning methods focused primarily on images or text. 

- The approach combines ideas from SimCLR (contrastive learning on images) and SCARF (contrastive learning on tabular data) to develop a multimodal contrastive training framework.

- The method is evaluated on predicting cardiac health from cardiac MRIs and tabular clinical data from 40K subjects in the UK Biobank. It shows improved performance over supervised and self-supervised baselines using images alone.

- Analysis reveals that certain types of tabular features like morphometric measures (size/shape related) are especially useful in the multimodal contrastive learning. 

- A new technique called "label as a feature" is introduced for supervised contrastive learning by simply appending target labels as a tabular feature during training.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that combining tabular and image data in a self-supervised contrastive framework can learn improved feature representations that translate to better downstream task performance compared to using images alone. The results on cardiac health prediction and analysis of feature importance seem to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the first self-supervised contrastive learning framework that combines tabular data (such as clinical measurements) and images. The method is based on SimCLR for images and SCARF for tabular data.

2. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning approach on predicting cardiac health from MR images combined with tabular clinical data from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. The method outperforms purely image-based and tabular-based contrastive learning baselines.

3. Showing the generalizability of the approach by applying it to combine car images and tabular advertisement data from the DVM dataset for predicting car models. Again the multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines.

4. Analyzing the learned representations using attribution methods and finding that morphometric tabular features (describing shape/size) play an outsized role during contrastive pretraining. The inclusion of such features is shown to boost performance.

5. Introducing a simple but effective supervised contrastive learning technique called "label as a feature" (LaaF) where the class label is appended as a tabular feature. This is shown to outperform previous supervised contrastive methods on the tasks considered.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating the first multimodal contrastive learning framework for tabular and image data, with analyses providing insights into why it is effective. The method has potential usefulness for learning from multimodal medical data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal contrastive learning framework that combines imaging data like MRIs with tabular clinical data to improve representation learning, showing benefits especially for small datasets like those found clinically vs large biobank datasets used for pretraining.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper proposes a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework that combines imaging and tabular data for representation learning. Most prior work in self-supervised learning has focused only on images or only on tabular data separately. Jointly learning from multimodal data like images and tables is an emerging area of research.

- The proposed method is based on combining SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive self-supervised methods for images and tabular data respectively. Building on top of established methods is a strength, as it utilizes proven techniques as a starting point.

- The application to medical imaging and electronic health record data is relevant, as medical datasets often contain both images and clinical/demographic information. Applying self-supervised learning to make use of unlabeled medical data is an active research direction.

- The experiments demonstrate strong performance on predicting cardiac health from cardiac MR images and tabular data from 40,000 patients. Comparisons to supervised and single modality self-supervised baselines show the benefits of the multimodal approach.

- Analysis of the model using attribution methods provides interesting insights into how it leverages morphological features that have correlates across modalities during training. Understanding model behavior is an important contribution.

- The proposed "label as a feature" technique for supervised contrastive learning is novel and shows strong performance compared to prior supervised contrastive methods.

Overall, this paper introduces a new approach for self-supervised multimodal learning that pushes forward the state of the art in an important direction. The applications to medical data and model analysis add to the significance of the work. The comparisons to past work are fair and highlight the advances made.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Explore the behavior of the multimodal contrastive framework on additional tasks like segmentation and regression. The authors hypothesize segmentation could benefit if morphometric features like organ/region sizes are included in the tabular data. Regression may also benefit from morphometric tabular features.

- Test the framework with more balanced datasets or explore any propagated biases learned from unbalanced datasets. The current work only used white subjects from the UK Biobank due to underrepresentation of other ethnicities. There are known racial disparities in the prediction tasks that could lead to spurious correlations. 

- Increase the importance/effect of the label during supervised contrastive pretraining for binary classification tasks. The authors found limited gains from their label-as-a-feature approach on the imbalanced binary cardiac tasks and suggest adapting the loss function or strategy to boost the effect of the label.

- Further explore combinations of the label-as-a-feature strategy with other supervised contrastive learning techniques. Initial results showed combining label-as-a-feature with methods like supervised contrastive learning and false negative elimination improves performance. More exploration on optimal combinations is suggested.

- Generalize the label-as-a-feature technique to non-tabular modalities like images and text. The authors currently only append labels as tabular features but suggest this could work for other data types.

- Scale up the framework and evaluate on larger and more diverse datasets. The current work looks at two datasets, so testing on more and larger datasets is recommended.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring the framework's applicability to different tasks and data types, improving label integration, evaluating potential biases, and scaling up the experiments. The core idea of multimodal contrastive learning for tabular and imaging data seems promising based on the initial results.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a multimodal contrastive learning framework that combines tabular data and images for self-supervised pretraining. The method is based on SimCLR and SCARF for images and tabular data respectively. Experiments on predicting myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease risks using cardiac MR images and clinical features from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects show the strength of the approach. The framework also generalizes to natural images using the DVM car advertisement dataset. Through attribution and ablation studies, it is found that morphometric tabular features related to size and shape have an outsized importance during contrastive learning. Finally, a novel form of supervised contrastive learning called label as a feature (LaaF) is introduced where the label is simply appended as a tabular feature. LaaF outperforms standard supervised contrastive strategies and can be combined with them. Overall, the paper demonstrates an effective way to leverage both tabular and imaging data for self-supervised pretraining that learns useful representations for downstream tasks using only one modality. Key strengths are the simplicity, strong performance, interpretability, and ability to incorporate labels into the contrastive process.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents the first contrastive learning framework that combines tabular and imaging data for self-supervised pretraining. The method is motivated by medical datasets like biobanks that contain extensive tabular data with rich clinical information in addition to medical images. However, it is often not feasible to acquire the same diverse and large-scale data in a clinical setting. The proposed solution pretrains on the combined data modalities from large datasets like biobanks, and can then be applied in the clinic using just images as input. 

The framework combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning approaches, to leverage both images and tabular data. It is evaluated on predicting cardiac health from MR images and tabular clinical data from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. The method outperforms supervised and self-supervised baselines. Through attribution analysis, it is found that morphometric tabular features related to size and shape are particularly impactful in the multimodal training process. A new form of supervised contrastive learning called label-as-a-feature is also introduced, where the label is simply appended as a tabular feature. This strategy outperforms other techniques for incorporating labels like supervised contrastive learning and false negative elimination. Overall, the work demonstrates the utility of combining tabular and imaging data in a self-supervised framework for more effective pretrained representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework that utilizes both imaging and tabular data for self-supervised pre-training. The method is based on SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning algorithms. It trains separate encoders for images and tabular data which output embeddings that are projected into a shared latent space. The projections are optimized using a modified CLIP loss that maximizes agreement between projections of the same sample from both modalities, while minimizing agreement between different samples. Image augmentations like flipping and cropping are used, along with tabular corruption of features by sampling from the marginal distribution. This allows the model to learn useful representations by aligning the multimodal projections of the same subjects during pre-training, which can then be used to train classifiers using just one modality. Experiments demonstrate improved performance on cardiac disease prediction from MRI and car model identification from advertisement images when pre-training with both images and tabular data compared to pre-training with images alone.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the challenge of taking advantage of large multimodal medical datasets with both imaging and tabular data during pretraining, in order to improve performance on downstream tasks where less data may be available, potentially only a single modality. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that combines both tabular and imaging data, with the goal of learning useful representations that can then be applied to make predictions using only images or only tabular data. This could be beneficial in clinical settings where extensive multimodal data like in biobanks may not be readily available.

The key contributions seem to be:

- Proposing the first contrastive learning framework that incorporates both images and tabular data for self-supervised pretraining.

- Demonstrating this framework improves performance on downstream tasks using just images or just tabular data, compared to only self-supervised pretraining on one modality.

- Analyzing the framework to show morphometric tabular features related to size/shape are particularly important, as they have correlates in images.

- Introducing a novel supervised contrastive learning approach by appending ground truth labels as tabular features.

So in summary, the paper aims to develop self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning to take advantage of large biobank datasets and improve performance on clinical downstream tasks where less multimodal data may be available.
