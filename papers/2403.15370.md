# [Augmented Reality based Simulated Data (ARSim) with multi-view   consistency for AV perception networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely heavily on perception systems to navigate safely, which requires detecting a diverse range of objects in various driving scenarios. However, real-world data collected often lacks diversity and presents a long-tail distribution, with insufficient data for rarely-seen objects/scenarios like hazards. 

- Using only synthetic data faces challenges like domain gap from reduced realism and high effort for artists to create realistic environments. Existing methods like copy-paste lack multi-view consistency and 3D groundtruth.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents ARSim, an automated framework to enhance real multi-view data with realistic 3D synthetic objects of interest to address long-tail distribution. 

- It integrates domain adaptation and randomization - infers key domain attributes like lighting from real data to reduce domain gap and uses simulation-based randomization for other attributes.

- Estimates HDR lightmap from multi-view images, creates minimal 3D scene using real data, places synthetic assets realistically based on constraints like collision/occlusion. Renders objects across views using real camera parameters for multi-view consistency.

Main Contributions:
- Fully automated pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data by realistically augmenting real drive datasets with synthetic objects to address long-tail distribution.

- Demonstrated capability to maintain multi-view consistency, realistic illumination, proper shadow casting using inferred light distribution and camera parameters.

- Showcased augmented dataset's efficacy in improving performance across 3 key AV tasks - obstacle, freespace and parking perception using only a fraction of generated simulated data.
