# [AEGIS-Net: Attention-guided Multi-Level Feature Aggregation for Indoor   Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09538)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Indoor place recognition is challenging compared to outdoor scenes due to limited sensor coverage resulting in locality of information and structural/appearance similarities between indoor locations. Prior works have shown that using either 2D (RGB) or 3D (point clouds) alone is not sufficient. This paper tackles the problem of large-scale indoor place recognition.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes AEGIS-Net, an attention-guided multi-level feature aggregation network for indoor place recognition. It takes RGB point clouds as input to leverage both color and geometric features. In addition, it extracts implicit semantic features using an encoder pre-trained on a semantic segmentation task. The core of AEGIS-Net is the use of self-attention (SA) layers to select the most relevant local features across multiple levels before aggregating them into a global descriptor using NetVLAD.  

The network has 3 main components:
1) Semantic encoder + decoder (pre-trained on semantic segmentation) 
2) Attention-guided feature embedding (SA layers + NetVLAD)
3) Two-stage training procedure: first train encoder+decoder, then train feature embedding part

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of self-attention to guide selection of important local color, geometry and semantic features for place recognition
- State-of-the-art performance on ScanNetPR dataset, outperforming prior RGB, RGB-D and point cloud based methods
- Ablation studies demonstrate contribution of attention mechanism - improves performance and training efficiency

In summary, the key novelty is the use of self-attention to aggregate multi-level features including semantics while ensuring only the most relevant features are selected to describe the place. This results in a robust and highly discriminative global descriptor for indoor place recognition.
