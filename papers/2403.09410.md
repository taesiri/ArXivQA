# [XCoOp: Explainable Prompt Learning for Computer-Aided Diagnosis via   Concept-guided Context Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing vision-language model (VLM) prompt learning methods result in uninterpretable learned prompts, lacking explainability. This prevents their application in high-stakes domains like healthcare which require trustworthiness and interpretability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes XCoOp, a novel explainable prompt learning framework that introduces medical knowledge by aligning image, learnable prompt and concept-driven prompt semantics at multiple levels. 

It designs disease-specific prompts using medical concepts from datasets with annotations or by eliciting knowledge from language models. A multi-granularity alignment module aligns soft prompts with concept prompts at both token and prompt levels via contrastive learning. This makes each token more informative, guided by concepts.

A global-local image-prompt module aligns images and prompts at global and local levels, mimicking expertsâ€™ use of multi-scale visual cues for diagnosis.

Main Contributions:

(1) First work to address interpretability challenge in prompt learning for explainable AI (XAI). Incorporates concept-based medical knowledge to make prompts interpretable.

(2) Flexibly applies to datasets with or without annotations by eliciting knowledge from foundation models. Alleviates human labeling requirements.

(3) Comprehensive experiments and XAI analysis using faithfulness, understandability and plausibility metrics demonstrate superior performance and interpretability over state-of-the-art. Showcases foundation model-enabled XAI.

In summary, the paper makes prompt learning interpretable for high-stakes healthcare applications by introducing formalized medical knowledge into the optimization process across multiple semantic levels. Explainability is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) It proposes XCoOp, a novel explainable prompt learning framework that leverages concept-based medical knowledge at multiple granularities to make the prompts more explainable. This is the first work to address the lack of interpretability in prompt learning methods.
