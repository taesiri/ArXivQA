# [Content Conditional Debiasing for Fair Text Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Biases in text embeddings generated by pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been identified in several studies. Attaining fairness in text embedding models is crucial to mitigate issues in downstream applications. Recent debiasing techniques either completely remove sensitive information, harming utility, or lack proper training data. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new method called Content Conditional Debiasing (CCD) to learn fair text embeddings. The key ideas are:

1) Achieve conditional independence between sensitive attributes and text embeddings conditioned on the content. This allows using sensitive attributes to predict embeddings but only through content, preventing sensitive attributes from being exploited as a proxy for content.  

2) Enforce that embeddings of texts with different sensitive attributes but same content have equal distance to the embedding of corresponding neutral text. This conditional independence is represented as content-conditioned equal distance.

3) Address lack of training data by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment texts into different sensitive groups. Replaces sensitive words with equivalents from different groups.

Main Contributions:

- Formalizes the notion of content-conditioned equal distance fairness and proves it aligns with conditional independence between sensitive attributes and text embeddings.

- Designs a debiasing loss function to enforce content-conditioned equal distance on embedding space. Additional loss term preserves utility.

- Proposes an LLM-based data augmentation strategy to generate texts linked to the same content but varied in sensitive attributes. Enables debiasing given scarcity of sensitive labeled data.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate improved fairness while preserving utility of embeddings, with state-of-the-art performance on debiasing benchmarks and downstream tasks.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in achieving conditional independence for fair text embeddings via a novel debiasing approach and data augmentation strategy. The method represents an effective way to balance fairness and utility.
