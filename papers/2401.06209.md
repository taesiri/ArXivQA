# [Eyes Wide Shut? Exploring the Visual Shortcomings of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in multimodal models rely heavily on powerful language models paired with the CLIP vision encoder. However, these models still exhibit systematic visual shortcomings on even basic visual questions. 
- The paper investigates where these visual deficiencies originate - is it an issue with the visual modality, language understanding, or their alignment? They hypothesize limitations in CLIP encoders may cascade into downstream multimodal LLMs.

Methodology:  
- Identify "CLIP-blind" image pairs that CLIP embeds similarly but have clear visual differences based on a vision-only SSL model like DINO. Use these to construct the Multimodal Visual Patterns (MMVP) benchmark to evaluate MLLMs.
- Summarize 9 prevalent visual patterns that challenge CLIP, like orientation and counting. Assess if scaling CLIP models in data and size resolves these patterns.
- Propose Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approaches to incorporate SSL vision features into MLLMs to enhance visual grounding. Test additive and interleaved MoF strategies.

Key Findings:
- Leading MLLMs still struggle on MMVP's simple visual questions, while humans answer 95.7% accurately. Shortcomings likely originate from visual encoders.
- 7 out of 9 identified CLIP failure patterns persist despite scaling. CLIP weaknesses directly correlate with MLLM errors.  
- Interleaved MoF improves visual grounding in MLLMs by 10.7% without compromising language understanding compared to just using CLIP.

In summary, the paper provides strong evidence that limitations in prevalent CLIP encoders cascade into multimodal models. Overcoming these systematic vision representation gaps is critical for future progress in multimodal LLMs. The paper introduces valuable analysis and benchmarking for diagnosis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies visual shortcomings in multimodal large language models, proposes benchmarks to systematically evaluate models on basic visual patterns which they struggle with, and explores mixing vision-only and vision-language features to enhance visual grounding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It identifies systematic visual shortcomings in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), even in advanced models like GPT-4V, by constructing a benchmark called Multimodal Visual Patterns (MMVP) using "CLIP-blind" image pairs.

2) It categorizes the visual patterns that challenge CLIP-based vision encoders into 9 types, such as orientation, counting, etc, and shows that these issues persist even with scaling up data and models. 

3) It demonstrates a correlation between the failure patterns in CLIP models and those in downstream MLLMs.

4) It proposes a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach to incorporate self-supervised vision features into MLLMs to enhance their visual grounding capabilities without compromising instruction following abilities.

In summary, the paper identifies and characterizes visual deficiencies in current MLLMs, traces their origins to limitations in prevalent CLIP encoders, and takes initial steps to address these issues via improved visual representations. It suggests continued progress in visual representation learning is important for advancing multimodal AI systems.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs): Models that integrate vision and language modalities, such as GPT-4V, Bard, LLaVA.

- Visual shortcomings: Systematic deficiencies exhibited by MLLMs in processing visual information and answering basic visual questions. 

- CLIP-blind pairs: Image pairs that are encoded similarly by CLIP despite clear visual differences, indicating issues in the CLIP visual encoder. 

- Multimodal Visual Patterns (MVP) benchmark: A diagnostic benchmark constructed using CLIP-blind pairs to evaluate visual capabilities of MLLMs.

- Visual patterns: Nine categories summarizing the types of visual concepts that challenge CLIP and downstream MLLMs, like orientation, counting, color, etc.

- Mixture-of-Features (MoF): Techniques to incorporate both CLIP and standalone vision SSL features to improve MLLM visual grounding.

- Interleaved MoF: Spatially interleaving CLIP and vision SSL token embeddings.

The key focus areas are evaluating and improving the visual capabilities in multimodal LLMs, using systematic benchmarking and mixture-of-features to address limitations arising from over-reliance on CLIP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a Mixture of Features (MoF) approach to improve the visual grounding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). What are some of the key challenges and considerations when determining how to best mix different visual features extracted from multiple models?

2. The Interleaved MoF approach spatially interleaves CLIP and DINOv2 visual tokens. What are some alternative ways to fuse the features that could also maintain both good visual grounding and instruction following abilities? 

3. The paper finds vision-only self-supervised learning (SSL) features from models like DINOv2 are more effective for visual grounding but hurt instruction following. Why might this be the case? What properties make SSL features better for visual tasks but worse for language understanding?

4. Could the types of images used during pre-training of CLIP vs. DINOv2 impact what visual patterns each model struggles with? How might the distribution of pre-training data relate to model failures?

5. The paper studies adding DINOv2 features to CLIP-based MLLMs. How might incorporating other vision SSL methods like MAE, SimCLR, or SwAV compare? What unique advantages might they offer?

6. What modifications could be made to the way CLIP encodes images during pre-training to make it capture more intricate visual details? Can we design better text-image prediction objectives?

7. The paper finds big models still overlook elementary visual details. Besides issues in the vision encoder, what other root causes could contribute to poor visual grounding in large MLLMs? 

8. How suitable are the identified visual patterns for evaluating vision abilities beyond MLLMs? Could the patterns generalize to other vision tasks like detection, segmentation, etc?

9. The paper proposes the \ours{} benchmark constructed from CLIP-blind image pairs. What are some limitations of this methodology? How else might we systematically assess model failures?

10. What might be some real-world implications if deployed MLLMs struggle with basic visual questions as identified in this paper? In what application scenarios could this be highly problematic?
