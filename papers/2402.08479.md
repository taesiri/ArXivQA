# [Plausible Extractive Rationalization through Semi-Supervised Entailment   Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Complex black box models like BERT lack interpretability and it's unclear what parts of the input text they focus on to make predictions. 
- Explainable AI models like extractive rationalization (ETP) models aim to provide explanations by highlighting rationales in the input text. However, they require human annotated rationales which are scarce.  
- Existing supervised and unsupervised methods have limitations in rationale plausibility and model robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a semi-supervised approach with a pre-trained NLI model, finetuned on a small subset (10%) of annotated rationales. 
- Transform the annotations and task labels into entailment labels to provide supervision signals to the explainer via the NLI model.
- Enforce entailment alignment between extracted rationales and task predictions to improve plausibility without full annotation.
- Use the NLI model to verify alignment at inference time to improve robustness.

Main Contributions:
- A simple yet effective semi-supervised approach to improve rationale plausibility and model robustness using limited annotations.
- First work to use an NLI predictor to generate augmented annotation labels for extractive rationalization. 
- Achieves competitive performance to supervised models and significantly outperforms unsupervised methods.
- Has low resource requirements - uses models with <300M parameters and 10% annotated rationales.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to use an NLI predictor to enhance extractive rationalization models with limited supervision through transformed annotation labels and entailment alignment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a semi-supervised approach to improve the plausibility and robustness of extractive rationalization models by leveraging natural language inference signals from a small subset of annotated rationales.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A simple yet effective approach that improves the plausibility and robustness of extracted rationales for explainable AI models, while simultaneously improving task performance. The approach achieves competitive results against supervised models while outperforming unsupervised models by a large margin.

2) The first work to utilize an auxiliary natural language inference (NLI) predictor to generate augmented labels for training the rationale extractor in an explain-then-predict model. The NLI predictor provides useful supervisory signals.

3) The approach has low resource requirements, using models with less than 300 million parameters and only a small subset (10%) of human-annotated rationales for further fine-tuning the NLI predictor.

In summary, the key contribution is a semi-supervised method to optimize for the plausibility of extracted rationales using an NLI predictor, which leads to improvements in both plausibility and robustness of the overall explainable AI model.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Extractive rationalization - The paper focuses on extractive rationalization models, also known as Explain-Then-Predict (ETP) models, which generate highlights from the input text as explanations to support the model's predictions.

- Plausibility - A key goal is improving the plausibility of the extracted rationales, i.e. increasing agreement with human judgments. Plausibility is optimized rather than faithfulness. 

- Semi-supervised learning - The proposed approach uses a small set (10%) of supervised rationales to fine-tune a natural language inference (NLI) model, which then provides training signals to the explainer model in a semi-supervised manner.

- Robustness - The paper analyzes the robustness of different methods by adding adversarial prefaces to the input and measuring differences in performance. The proposed method shows improved robustness.

- Low resource requirements - The approach uses a small set of annotated rationales, models with <300M parameters, and does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for low-resource scenarios.

Other terms that feature prominently: entailment alignment, label transformation, ERASER benchmark datasets (FEVER, MultiRC, BoolQ), information bottleneck.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using an NLI predictor to generate artificial targets for the explainer. Why is an NLI predictor well-suited for this task compared to other auxiliary models? What properties make it useful for improving the plausibility of rationales?

2. The paper transforms the annotated rationales into NLI labels to train the NLI predictor. What assumptions does this transformation make about the relationship between the rationale sentences and the task label (e.g. claim in FEVER)?

3. During training, the NLI predictions are transformed back into rationale targets for the explainer. What could be some potential downsides of relying on the NLI predictor to generate rationale labels? In what cases might it fail?  

4. The inference process involves using the NLI predictor to cross-check the extracted rationales against the task prediction. Why is this helpful? In what scenarios would you expect it to have the most impact?

5. What types of datasets or tasks do you think this semi-supervised approach would be most or least effective for? Explain why.

6. The paper shows lower performance gains on BoolQ. What characteristics of the BoolQ dataset make it more challenging for the proposed approach? How could the method be adapted to better handle such cases?

7. The paper demonstrates improved robustness to adversarial inputs compared to other methods. What properties of the NLI-based training enable more robust rationale extraction?  

8. How does the amount of annotated rationales used for NLI fine-tuning impact performance? Is there a point of diminishing returns as more labelled data is added?

9. Could this approach be extended to abstractive rationalization models? What challenges might arise in that setting compared to extractive models?

10. The paper uses a pipeline setup with separate encoder, explainer and predictor modules. How difficult would it be to adapt this approach to an end-to-end trained model? Would the benefits still hold in that case?
