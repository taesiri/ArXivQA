# [Deal, or no deal (or who knows)? Forecasting Uncertainty in   Conversations using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies how well language models can represent inherent uncertainty about future outcomes in conversations. While even the best human conversationalists cannot perfectly anticipate dialogue trajectories, it's unclear if language models possess even basic capabilities like anticipating outcome certainty. Modeling uncertainty is important for applications like analyzing negotiation strategies, intervening in conversations, and assessing data quality.

Method: 
The paper proposes a new task called Forecasting Uncertainty in Dialogue (FUnDial) to evaluate a model's ability to make probabilistic forecasts of outcomes that account for uncertainty. The task involves giving a model the first part of a negotiation dialogue and asking it to forecast the probability of a specified outcome occurring. Evaluation uses proper scoring rules that account for both calibration and variance of forecasts. The paper explores implicit forecasts based on model confidence and direct textual forecasts. It also proposes fine-tuning strategies to improve calibration.

Experiments:
Experiments are conducted on 8 negotiation datasets spanning distributive and collaborative settings. Models like GPT-4, Llama-2 and Zephyr are evaluated. Results show:
- GPT-4 performs well but tuning can further improve smaller models 
- Implicit forecasts generalize best in-domain while direct forecasts better handle distribution shift
- Exploration during policy learning and using data to set priors improves robustness
- Tuning boosts 7B Llama-2 over its 70B version by 11% in-domain
- Distillation may bias models to underpredict negative affective outcomes 

Contributions:
- New task and evaluation paradigm to assess conversational uncertainty
- Tuning methods to improve calibration of uncertainty estimates 
- Analysis of model scale, tuning strategies and priors on robustness
- Public release of models, code and data to enable further research

The paper delivers valuable insights into modeling uncertainty in dialogues and provides practical algorithms to improve forecast quality. Released resources support continued research in this promising direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes methods to improve language models' ability to represent uncertainty about future outcomes in negotiations, using proper scoring functions and tuning techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Formalizing the conversation uncertainty modeling task, along with proposing evaluation metrics for it (proper scoring functions that account for both calibration and variance of forecasts).

2. Introducing two methods for representing uncertainty about conversational outcomes using language models: implicit forecasts based on yes/no affirmations, and direct forecasts based on probability expressions in the text.

3. Proposing fine-tuning (both supervised and reinforcement learning based) and inference-time strategies for improving these uncertainty representations in language models.

4. Experiments on 8 negotiation tasks demonstrating that the proposed fine-tuning strategies can calibrate smaller open-source language models to compete with pre-trained models 10x their size in representing uncertainty. The experiments also provide insights into the biases of pre-trained models, impact of scale, and generalization capability of different tuning strategies.

In summary, the main contribution is formalizing the conversation uncertainty modeling task, proposing methods to represent uncertainty in language models, and showing their effectiveness via proper scoring functions after specialized tuning. The paper also provides analysis to gain useful insights about modeling uncertainty in conversations with language models.

The paper examines the ability of language models to represent uncertainty about future outcomes in conversations, specifically in the context of negotiations. It proposes methods to evaluate this through proper scoring functions and calibration metrics. The main contributions relate to modeling uncertainty in language model forecasts, using both implicit signals in model scores and direct signals in model textual outputs. Various fine-tuning strategies are explored to improve the calibration of uncertainty estimates from the models, including traditional supervised learning and off-policy reinforcement learning techniques. Experiments are conducted on multiple negotiation dialogue datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two main methods for representing uncertainty about future conversation outcomes using language models: implicit forecasts and direct forecasts. What are the key differences and challenges between these two approaches? How might they complement each other?

2. The paper introduces a new reinforcement learning based fine-tuning approach specifically for improving calibration of direct forecasts from language models. What are the main benefits of using reinforcement learning instead of standard supervised learning in this context? What are some of the potential drawbacks? 

3. One of the key components proposed is the use of an off-policy policy gradient update rule during direct forecast tuning. What is the motivation behind using an off-policy update? What are some of the subtleties involved in correctly implementing and evaluating an off-policy policy gradient method?

4. The paper explores using different off-policy distributions during direct forecast tuning, such as an explorer, exploiter, and quantizer. What might be some of the tradeoffs between on-policy and off-policy tuning in this setting? When might on-policy tuning be preferred?

5. Post-hoc corrections like temperature scaling are explored for both implicit and direct forecasts. The paper unifies these typically disparate lines of work. What might be some of the limitations of post-hoc corrections techniques and when might they fail or provide limited improvements? 

6. The use of natural language priors is studied to provide models initial knowledge about uncertainty. When might providing incorrect or low-quality priors be detrimental versus beneficial for model calibration and uncertainty accuracy?

7. The paper evaluates models under different train/test distribution shifts, ranging from in-domain to pseudo and zero-shot out-of-domain settings. What types of model architectures and tuning procedures are likely to generalize better under such distribution shifts?

8. The study uses proper scoring rules like the Brier score to evaluate model calibration. What are some of the benefits and potential limitations of using proper scoring rules versus other model evaluation metrics in this setting?

9. The paper introduces a new Llama skill score metric. What are the motivations behind this new metric and how does it differ from the standard Brier skill score? What are its advantages and disadvantages?

10. The study focuses primarily on modelling uncertainty for negotiation dialogues. What are some of the unique challenges and opportunities involved with generalization to other dialogue domains and tasks? What adaptations might be required?
