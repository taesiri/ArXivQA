# [Looking Beyond What You See: An Empirical Analysis on Subgroup   Intersectional Fairness for Multi-label Chest X-ray Classification Using   Social Determinants of Racial Health Inequities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for disease diagnosis using chest X-rays have shown good performance but can perpetuate biases against protected groups based on race, gender, etc. 
- Most prior work has focused on single attributes like race or gender rather than intersections of multiple attributes.
- There is limited research on incorporating social determinants of health (SDOH) like income and insurance into evaluating model fairness.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a framework to achieve accuracy and fairness across intersectional groups in multi-label chest X-ray classification. 
- Go beyond traditional protected attributes to complex interactions of race, income (median household income), and insurance (uninsured population percentage).
- Retrain the last classification layer of pre-trained models using a balanced dataset across the 8 intersectional groups.
- Incorporate fairness constraints in the loss function related to false positive rate and false negative rate differences between groups.
- Account for class imbalance by weighting the loss terms.

Key Contributions:
- Consider more granular benchmarking and evaluation of fairness using intersections of race, income, and insurance derived from SDOH datasets.
- Extend prior binary classification and two attribute intersectionality works to multi-label classification with multiple attributes.
- Demonstrate improved equalized odds difference and accuracy-fairness on MIMIC-CXR dataset compared to baselines like empirical risk minimization.
- Provide a simple, practical and effective framework to enhance model fairness for real-world clinical applications.
