# Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the   capabilities of language models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question it seeks to address is: how do the capabilities and limitations of large language models change as the models are scaled up in size?Some more details:- The paper discusses how increasing the scale (size) of language models leads to qualitative improvements in capabilities. However, these new capabilities are not yet well characterized or understood. - The goal is to benchmark a diverse set of language tasks that are currently beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art models. By evaluating models across a range of scales on these tasks, the aim is to better understand the present and near-future abilities of language models.- Specifically, the paper introduces the "Beyond the Imitation Game" benchmark (BIG-bench) consisting of over 200 difficult language tasks. Models ranging from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters are evaluated on BIG-bench.- The results are analyzed not just to evaluate current models, but to try to predict and extrapolate how performance will improve with future increases in scale.In summary, the key research question is understanding and quantifying how the capabilities of language models change with scale, as measured by performance on a new diverse benchmark of difficult language tasks. The goal is to anticipate future abilities as models continue to grow in size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and other information provided, it seems this paper introduces a new benchmark called BIG-bench for evaluating large language models. The key features and contributions of BIG-bench appear to be:- It consists of over 200 diverse language tasks covering a wide range of topics beyond what current benchmarks test, such as linguistics, math, social bias, etc.- The benchmark focuses on tasks that are difficult and not fully solvable by current language models. This is meant to help characterize capabilities and limitations of models across scales.- It provides human evaluator baseline scores on the tasks to allow comparison to model performance.- It evaluates performance of various language models ranging from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters on the benchmark. - It introduces a subset called BIG-bench Lite with 24 tasks for faster evaluation.- The benchmark tasks and API are open source to allow community contributions.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be the introduction of this large, diverse benchmark focused on challenging tasks as a way to better understand language model capabilities across scales and predict future progress and limitations. The open source and collaborative nature of the benchmark also appears to be a key contribution.
