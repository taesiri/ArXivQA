# [Prompt Risk Control: A Rigorous Framework for Responsible Deployment of   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13628)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key ideas from the paper:

This paper proposes a framework called Prompt Risk Control (PRC) for responsibly deploying large language models (LLMs). PRC allows users to select a prompt for an LLM based on rigorous upper bounds it provides on various risk measures, instead of just validation set performance. These risk measures, like conditional value at risk and statistical dispersion metrics, characterize aspects beyond average loss, such as tail risks and outcome inequality across groups. The framework utilizes distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques to produce high-probability bounds on these measures for each prompt. It returns the set of prompts satisfying constraints on the risk thresholds set by the user. Thus PRC enables controlling LLM risk to acceptable levels before deployment. The authors demonstrate the value of this lightweight framework on LLM applications like open-ended chat, code generation, and medical question summarization. They also introduce methods to produce valid bounds even under distribution shift between the validation and deployment data. Overall, PRC provides effective and principled control of risks in LLM deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Prompt Risk Control, a framework for selecting prompts for large language model deployment based on rigorous upper bounds on user-chosen risk measures in order to control and reduce the likelihood of poor model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called Prompt Risk Control (PRC) for selecting prompts for large language models based on rigorous upper bounds on risk measures, in order to reduce the likelihood of poor generations during deployment. The paper offers methods for producing bounds on metrics like worst-case responses and disparities across groups, and extends the underlying statistical techniques to accommodate distribution shifts between the validation and deployment data. Through experiments on tasks like open-ended chat, medical question summarization, and code generation, the paper shows how PRC can enable responsible deployment by controlling various notions of risk.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Prompt risk control (PRC): A framework for selecting prompts for large language models based on risk bounds rather than just validation set performance. Seeks to reduce the risk of poor generations during deployment.

- Distribution-free uncertainty quantification (DFUQ): Statistical techniques for producing bounds on performance metrics that hold with high probability without making assumptions about the data distribution. Key tools used in PRC.

- Risk measures: Quantities that measure some aspect of the distribution of loss across a population, rather than just the loss for one example. Includes mean, quantile-based measures like VaR and CVaR, and dispersion measures like Gini coefficient. 

- Validation vs deployment distribution shift: The assumption needed for DFUQ bounds that the validation data matches what the model will face when deployed. New methods introduced to produce some bounds under distribution shifts.

- Prompt selection: The process of choosing a text prompt to append to model inputs in order to guide the model's generations. Still an experimental area so PRC offers rigorous validation.

- High impact domains: Areas like medicine, law, and finance where poor model performance could significantly affect individuals or society. PRC allows managing performance vs. safety tradeoffs.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Prompt Risk Control differ from traditional methods of prompt selection that are solely based on average validation performance? What additional considerations does it take into account?

2. What statistical techniques does Prompt Risk Control leverage to produce bounds on risk measures? How do they provide guarantees on the likelihood of poor generations?

3. Why is controlling tail risk and loss dispersion important when deploying large language models? In what types of applications might these be most critical to consider?  

4. The paper introduces new methods for extending risk control guarantees to the distribution shift setting. What assumptions are made about the validation and deployment distributions? How are importance weights estimated?

5. What practical steps would need to be taken to integrate Prompt Risk Control into an existing large language model deployment pipeline? What are the computational and data requirements?  

6. Can you walk through a detailed example of using Prompt Risk Control in an application like open-ended chat? What prompts might be candidates and what risk thresholds and measures could you choose?

7. The paper demonstrates the method on a diverse set of tasks. What were the strengths and limitations observed in each case study? Were there any cases where acceptable risk control could not be achieved?

8. How does Prompt Risk Control account for randomness in model generations, for instance when sampling is used during inference? What assumptions need to hold for the statistical guarantees to remain valid?  

9. What open challenges exist in evaluating, understanding, and controlling risks of large language model generations? What future work directions might combine well with this method?

10. Do you think techniques like Prompt Risk Control should become a standard part of the large language model development process? What benefits or challenges do you foresee if organizations adopted such methods more widely?
