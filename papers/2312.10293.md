# [Inductive Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs using Path-based Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10293)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inductive link prediction is an important but challenging task in knowledge graphs, where models need to predict links for unseen entities based only on the topological graph structure and without additional entity embeddings. 
- Existing methods either depend too much on logical rules that lack generosity, or use graph neural networks that still rely on entity embeddings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two path-based inductive link prediction models using siamese neural networks - a connection-based model and a subgraph-based model.
- The connection-based model takes connecting paths between two entities as input to predict their relationship. 
- The subgraph-based model takes out-reaching paths from two entities as input for link prediction.
- Both models only use relation embeddings and path embeddings, excluding entity embeddings, making them strictly inductive.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes two novel path-based neural network models for inductive link prediction that do not rely on entity embeddings.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on standard inductive link prediction benchmarks including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and Nell-995. 
- Shows the trade-off between accuracy and strict inductiveness, where the models perform very strongly on FB15K-237 but are less competitive on the dense WN18RR graphs.
- Performs particularly well on relation-corrupted link prediction tasks across benchmarks.
- Demonstrates the models' inductive capabilities by generalizing to unseen entities based purely on path embeddings and topological graph structure.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards strictly inductive path-based neural models for link prediction without relying on entity embeddings.
