# [MemoChat: Tuning LLMs to Use Memos for Consistent Long-Range Open-Domain   Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08239)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can large language models (LLMs) be effectively tuned to use self-composed memos for maintaining consistent long-range open-domain conversations?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes MemoChat, a pipeline to refine instructions for guiding LLMs to use on-the-fly memos for consistent long-range conversations. 

- MemoChat demonstrates long-range conversations through "memorization-retrieval-response" cycles, where the LLM memorizes past dialogues into structured memos, retrieves relevant memos when needed, and generates responses based on retrieved memos.

- The paper designs tailored tuning instructions reconstructed from public datasets to teach the LLM the skills for each stage of the cycle - memorizing, retrieving, and responding with memos.

- Experiments on different LLMs show MemoChat helps improve consistency in long-range conversations compared to baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of tailored instruction tuning.

In summary, the central research question is how to enable LLMs to effectively use self-composed memos to maintain consistent responses in long conversational contexts, which MemoChat aims to address through tailored instruction tuning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in long-range open-domain conversation:

- Focus on tuning LLMs for self-use of memos: This paper proposes MemoChat, an approach to guide LLMs to use simple on-the-fly memos for maintaining consistent long conversations. This differs from other work that relies on external memory modules and retrieval tools. The emphasis on simplifying the pipeline to pure LLMs is novel.

- Instruction tuning methodology: The paper leverages instruction tuning, which has shown effectiveness for various LLM tasks. But the design of specialized instructions for memo writing, retrieval, and integration is new and enables training LLMs for the three key abilities needed.

- Downstream evaluation for consistency: The paper introduces a expert-annotated benchmark focused on evaluating consistency in long chats. This provides a more robust testbed compared to prior work that looked at more general quality.

- Experiments with major LLMs: The paper tests MemoChat on both API models like GPT-3 and open-source models like T5, ViCuNa, showing broad applicability. Comparisons to baselines like MPC and MemoryBank are also more comprehensive.

Overall, this paper makes solid contributions in terms of the memo-focused approach, instruction methodology, benchmark, and experiments. The simplification and specialization for long chat consistency seem to push forward the state of the art, based on the results and comparisons presented. The instruction tuning idea could also inform LLM training for other tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different prompt design strategies for instruction tuning. The authors mention prompt copy, data imbalance, and prompt logic as challenges faced when designing effective prompts. Further research could explore how to optimize prompts to improve instruction tuning performance.

- Applying MemoChat to models with longer text windows. The authors used a 2k text window in their experiments but suggest MemoChat could be flexibly adapted for models with longer windows. Testing MemoChat with expanded context lengths could be an interesting extension.

- Improving query-answering and long-form reasoning abilities. The authors note limitations in conjunction-type question performance, suggesting room for enhancing reasoning and multi-hop question answering skills.

- Testing MemoChat on a wider range of open-source LLMs. The authors experimented with several LLMs but suggest evaluating MemoChat on more models, especially as new LLMs continue to emerge.

- Exploring unsupervised or weakly supervised approaches. The authors used full supervision with human annotations/summaries during instruction tuning. Investigating techniques like self-supervised learning could reduce annotation needs.

- Applying MemoChat to other dialogue tasks. The authors focused on open-domain conversations but suggest MemoChat may transfer to other dialogue applications like goal-oriented conversations.

In summary, the main future directions encompass prompt engineering, model scaling, reasoning improvements, expanded model testing, reducing supervision, and new task applications for the MemoChat approach.

The overall approach provides a way to utilize simple memos to overcome limits in context size and improve consistency in long conversations spanning diverse topics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new pipeline called MemoChat for improving the consistency and coherence of large language models in long-range open-domain conversations. 

The key problem it aims to address is how to get LLMs to effectively utilize self-composed memos to maintain consistent conversations across multiple topics and turns. Traditional LLMs struggle with long conversations because they have a limited context window and can forget previous details. External memory systems have been explored but can be complex to integrate. 

The MemoChat pipeline seeks to guide LLMs to learn to write structured memos to summarize dialogue history, retrieve relevant memos for consistency, and integrate the memos when generating responses. The authors demonstrate how MemoChat can be trained with carefully designed instruction sets reconstructed from public datasets.

In summary, the paper tackles the issue of improving long-range conversational consistency for LLMs by teaching them to leverage on-the-fly memos rather than relying solely on the context window or external memory systems. The MemoChat pipeline aims to provide a simpler method for equipping LLMs with the skills to memorize, retrieve, and integrate memos themselves during open-domain dialogues.
