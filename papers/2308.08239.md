# MemoChat: Tuning LLMs to Use Memos for Consistent Long-Range Open-Domain   Conversation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can large language models (LLMs) be effectively tuned to use self-composed memos for maintaining consistent long-range open-domain conversations?The key points are:- The paper proposes MemoChat, a pipeline to refine instructions for guiding LLMs to use on-the-fly memos for consistent long-range conversations. - MemoChat demonstrates long-range conversations through "memorization-retrieval-response" cycles, where the LLM memorizes past dialogues into structured memos, retrieves relevant memos when needed, and generates responses based on retrieved memos.- The paper designs tailored tuning instructions reconstructed from public datasets to teach the LLM the skills for each stage of the cycle - memorizing, retrieving, and responding with memos.- Experiments on different LLMs show MemoChat helps improve consistency in long-range conversations compared to baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of tailored instruction tuning.In summary, the central research question is how to enable LLMs to effectively use self-composed memos to maintain consistent responses in long conversational contexts, which MemoChat aims to address through tailored instruction tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes MemoChat, a pipeline to guide large language models (LLMs) to use simple on-the-fly memos for maintaining consistent long-range open-domain conversations. MemoChat breaks down long conversations into "memorization-retrieval-response" loops.2. It designs three stages of instructions - for memo writing, memo retrieval, and chatting with memos - reconstructed from public datasets to teach LLMs the MemoChat pipeline. 3. It curates an expert-annotated benchmark dataset, MT-Bench+, to evaluate response consistency in long conversations.4. It conducts comprehensive experiments on both open-source and API-accessible LLMs to demonstrate MemoChat's efficacy in improving consistency compared to strong baselines.In summary, the key contribution is proposing MemoChat to equip LLMs with the ability to leverage on-the-fly memos for more consistent long-range open-domain conversations, along with instructions, benchmark, and experiments to validate this approach.
