# [Correcting Diffusion-Based Perceptual Image Compression with Privileged   End-to-End Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Integrating diffusion models into image compression is challenging as they struggle to guarantee distortion constraints while being good at generating perceptually pleasing images. The paper aims to leverage the generation capacity of diffusion models while controlling the distortion.

Method: 
The paper proposes CorrDiff, a novel diffusion-based image compression method. It employs a privileged end-to-end decoder to correct the sampling process of the diffusion decoder. This allows improving perceptual quality while ensuring distortion constraints.

Key ideas:
- Analyze approximation error of the score function used in diffusion model sampling when original images are visible at encoder side. This provides privileged information to facilitate error correction at the decoder.  

- Introduce an end-to-end convolutional decoder to better approximate the above error. Combine this decoder with the score network using a mathematically derived factor. Send these compact factors as privileged information to correct sampling.

- Theoretical analysis to derive the approximation and correction paradigm.

Contributions:
1. Proposes CorrDiff, a new diffusion-based image compression method with a privileged end-to-end decoder for sampling correction.

2. Provides theoretical analysis of the diffusion sampling process and derives the proposed correction paradigm.

3. Experiments show CorrDiff achieves superior performance in both distortion and perceptual metrics compared to previous methods. Ablation study validates the effectiveness of the proposed correction idea.
