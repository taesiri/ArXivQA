# [COMET: Generating Commit Messages using Delta Graph Context   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Commit messages explain code changes and are important for collaboration, but developers often write low-quality messages lacking context. 
- Existing automated commit message generation approaches have limitations in capturing context of code changes and producing high-quality messages.

Proposed Solution - COMET:
- Uses a novel graph-based representation called Delta Graph to capture code changes along with surrounding context.
- Employs a quality assurance module to rank generated messages based on customizable criteria.
- Fine-tunes a transformer-based model on Delta Graph representation to generate commit messages.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes Delta Graph to effectively represent code changes along with context.
- Provides a filtered dataset of high-quality commit messages for training.  
- Implements a customizable quality assurance module to select best message.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches on BLEU, METEOR and ROUGE-L.
- Shows competitive performance compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models.

The paper addresses limitations of prior work through the proposed Delta Graph representation and quality assurance module. By capturing code context better and ranking messages based on customizable criteria, COMET generates higher quality commit messages. The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes COMET, a novel commit message generation approach that captures code change context using a graph representation called delta graph and leverages a transformer model and quality assurance module to generate high-quality, customizable commit messages outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing \deltagraph{}, a novel graph-based representation of code changes that incorporates context along with code modifications. This representation can be used by researchers in software engineering problems involving code changes.

2) Providing a filtered dataset of high-quality commit messages that can be used to train commit message generation models. 

3) Implementing a fine-tuned encoder-decoder model trained on \deltagraph{} representations that achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating commit messages.

4) Offering a customizable quality assurance module that enables selecting the best message among generated options based on user-defined criteria.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective commit message generation approach called COMET that leverages a context-aware representation of code changes, ensures only high-quality data is used for training, fine-tunes a state-of-the-art model, and provides flexibility to choose messages that meet specific needs.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- Commit message generation
- Large language models
- Code property graphs 
- Graph neural networks

The paper proposes an approach called COMET for generating high-quality, context-aware commit messages using a graph-based representation of code changes called delta graphs. It introduces a quality assurance module to select optimal messages and leverages transformer models for text generation. The approach is evaluated using BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR against baseline methods.

So in summary, the key terms cover commit message generation, graph representations of code, neural network models, evaluation metrics, and the specific components of the COMET system proposed in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new graph-based representation called "delta graph" to capture code changes. Can you explain in detail the process of constructing a delta graph? What are the key components it captures compared to other representations like abstract syntax trees?

2. The quality assurance (QA) module in COMET ranks commit messages based on user-defined criteria. Can you walk through the full architecture and workflow of this module? How exactly does it allow customization of commit message selection based on organizational needs?  

3. The paper finds that incorporating context significantly boosts performance for encoder-decoder models but not the BLOOM decoder-only model. What reasons might explain why context helps encoder-decoders but actually hurts BLOOM?

4. What were the key factors considered when selecting the prompts to evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models? How did the survey methodology ensure prompt quality and minimize bias?

5. COMET outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on several metrics. Why might a smaller model fine-tuned on task-specific data beat models with orders of magnitude more parameters and training?

6. The study filters the MCMD dataset to only include high-quality commit messages. What specific filters and processing were applied? Why is this an important step?

7. The paper finds COMET matches or beats all baseline methods. Qualitatively analyze and compare commit messages generated by COMET versus the state-of-the-art RACE method.

8. What are some key limitations of existing accuracy metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for evaluating generated commit messages? How might better evaluation metrics be developed?  

9. The study focuses only on Java code changes. Discuss the steps needed to adapt COMET to other programming languages. What components would need to change?

10. The paper mentions improving scalability and handling larger codebases as areas for future work. What specific techniques could help COMET scale to large, real-world codebases and reduce inference time?
