# [AI Oversight and Human Mistakes: Evidence from Centre Court](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) oversight on human decision-making by studying the introduction of Hawk-Eye technology to review line calls made by umpires in professional tennis tournaments. Specifically, the paper examines whether the prospect of having their decisions overruled by an AI system alters the way human umpires make decisions. 

Prior work has shown AI can improve outcomes by overruling human mistakes in domains like law, medicine, and finance. However, little is known about how human decision-makers psychologically and behaviorally respond to the possibility of being overruled by an AI. This response is important for understanding the full equilibrium effects of AI oversight.

Proposed Solution:
The paper studies the impact of Hawk-Eye technology, introduced in 2006, which allows players to challenge umpire line calls. If a challenge is successful, the umpire's decision is overturned. The authors utilize a novel dataset tracking over 100 tournaments and 2,000 challenges to compare umpire performance before and after Hawk-Eye. 

The setting offers advantages such as an objectively correct decision, a reliable AI benchmark, and a simple binary choice. It also features public oversight that amplifies social pressures on the umpires.

Main Contributions:

1. Provides first evidence that prospect of AI oversight impacts human decision-making:
   - Umpires reduced overall mistakes by 8% but mistakes increased by 23% for serves landing within 20mm of lines
   - Umpires became 12.6% more likely to call balls in, shifting errors from "out" mistakes to "in" mistakes

2. Structural estimation suggests:
   - Umpires value avoiding "out" mistakes about twice as much under Hawk-Eye oversight
   - This aligns with rules making "out" mistakes more painful (points can't be recovered) 

3. Highlights two central reasons to cautiously approach AI oversight practices:
   - Incentive misalignment can increase overall mistakes
   - Public oversight (shaming) effects can dominate free-riding motives
   
Implications:
While AI oversight can improve outcomes, it can also unintentionally distort human decision-making in counterproductive ways. Understanding behavioral responses will help guide optimal policy and system design when combining AI and human judgments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper provides field evidence that introducing artificial intelligence oversight to reduce human mistakes can shift incentives in a way that leads to unintended distortions, such as tennis umpires calling more balls in to avoid the higher perceived cost of having their "out" calls overturned.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing the first field evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) oversight can impact human decision-making. Specifically, the authors study the introduction of Hawk-Eye review technology to overrule umpire mistakes in professional tennis tournaments. They find that while overall mistake rates decreased, there was actually an increase in mistakes on the closest calls during serves. The paper argues that this is due to asymmetric psychological costs from the public nature of being overruled, which distorted incentives and led umpires to shift from making some types of mistakes to others. The authors structurally estimate a model of rational inattention to quantify the psychological "oversight penalty" from AI correction. More broadly, the analysis highlights potential unintended equilibrium effects of AI oversight on human performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- AI oversight - The use of artificial intelligence systems to overrule human decisions and mistakes in work settings. A key aspect studied in the paper.

- Hawk-Eye review - The specific AI system used in professional tennis to review and overturn line judge calls. Serves as the main empirical setting. 

- Umpire decision-making - The focus of the study is on how the introduction of AI oversight impacts human (umpire) decision-making.

- Mistake rates - A key outcome variable examined is the rate at which human umpires make incorrect line calls before and after AI oversight.

- Type I and Type II errors - The paper analyzes how AI oversight changes the relative rates of these two error types (false positives and false negatives).

- Rational inattention - The theoretical framework used to model human decision-making and attention allocation. Extended to incorporate asymmetric costs and AI oversight penalties.  

- Psychological costs - Non-pecuniary costs borne by humans when overruled by AI, such as embarrassment. Estimated through the model.

So in summary, the key terms cover AI oversight, Hawk-Eye review, umpire decision-making, mistake rates, error types, rational inattention, and psychological costs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods in this paper:

1) The paper leverages a difference-in-differences design to estimate the impact of AI oversight on human decision making. What are some key assumptions needed for this empirical strategy to produce unbiased estimates? How might violations of these assumptions, like differential pre-trends, affect the interpretation of the results?

2) The paper focuses on the context of professional tennis umpiring. In what ways is this an ideal or non-ideal setting to study the impact of AI oversight on human decision making? What other contexts might allow for a cleaner identification of effects?  

3) The construct of "close calls" based on distance to the line is used extensively. What is the justification for using 20mm and 100mm as cutoffs? Would results be sensitive to alternative definitions of "close calls"? Is there a way to endogenously determine the appropriate cutoff based on observables?

4) The paper emphasizes the difference between serves and non-serves. What is the theoretical basis for expecting differential effects across these two shot types? Are serves truly more or less focused from an attentional perspective? What evidence is provided to support this?

5) Rational inattention models play a key role. What functional form assumptions are made about costs of attention and information structures? How binding are these assumptions for results on oversight penalties to be credible? 

6) The estimation procedure involves two stages. What parameters are recovered in each stage and what normalizations are made? What assumptions connect the first stage estimates to costs of attention?  

7) What game theoretic assumptions are embedded in the NIAS and NIAC conditions that rationalize observed choice probabilities? When might these assumptions fail in this setting?

8) There are many channels through which oversight could operating, including effort provision, pride, embarrassment etc. What testable predictions help distinguish between these channels? How might structural estimates change under alternative models?  

9) The estimates suggest players care twice as much about Type II errors after Hawk-Eye. Is there a way to directly estimate players' preferences rather than recover them via choice data? How robust is this 2x finding to changes in functional forms?

10) What data limitations impacted analysis in this paper? What additional data could allow for sharper identification of effects and estimation of oversight penalties?
