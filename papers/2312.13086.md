# [Multi-sensory Anti-collision Design for Autonomous Nano-swarm   Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Nano-drone swarms (drones <10cm diameter) have potential for exploration and search missions in cluttered environments. However, their ultra-constrained size limits their sensing, computing, and memory capabilities. This makes it challenging to enable robust collision avoidance and object detection abilities.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multi-sensory design combining a camera, 4 time-of-flight (ToF) sensors, and an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio.
- For obstacle avoidance, ToF distance readings are fused with collision probabilities predicted by a CNN (PULP-Dronet) on camera images. 
- For intra-swarm collision avoidance between drones, UWB radios are used for localization and maintaining safe distances.
- An exploration policy controls the swarm's navigation based on the fusion of ToF, camera, and UWB data.
- In parallel, a SSD object detector runs on the drones to enable visual search abilities.

Main Contributions:
- Multi-sensory nano-drone design for robust exploration in cluttered unknown environments.
- Evaluation showing 60% collision avoidance improvement over a baseline ToF-only system.
- UWB-based intra-swarm anticollision system with 92.8% success rate.
- Analysis of minimum PULP-Dronet throughput needed for adequate obstacle avoidance.
- Quantification of computing constraints - available platform only allows 1.6 FPS for CNN, limiting benefits.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a compact multi-sensor system to improve nano-drone swarm exploration robustness. The results highlight benefits but also bottlenecks in computing power for future nano-drone swarms.
