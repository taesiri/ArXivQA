# [Character Generation through Self-Supervised Vectorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02012)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a self-supervised drawing agent that can generate and parse characters by operating on stroke-level vector representations, using only raster images as supervision during training?

Some key points about the research question:

- The paper focuses on stroke-based image generation and parsing, where images are built up sequentially stroke-by-stroke rather than generated all at once. This allows the model to leverage the compositional structure of the images.

- The model operates directly on vector (stroke) representations rather than pixel representations. This avoids issues like blurriness that affect pixel-based models.

- Crucially, they aim to train the model using only raster images as supervision. Previous stroke-based models rely on full stroke-level supervision during training, which is costly to obtain. Their method is "self-supervised" in that it learns the vectorization purely from raster images.

- They aim to develop an agent that can handle multiple generation tasks (unconditional, conditioned on exemplar or type) as well as parsing/reconstruction. Showing one model architecture can successfully tackle all these tasks is an important contribution.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a self-supervised stroke-based drawing agent can match the performance of supervised approaches on generation and parsing tasks, using only raster images during training. The paper then supports this hypothesis through experiments on different datasets and tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a drawing agent that operates on the stroke-level representation of images for character generation and parsing. The key aspects of the agent are:

- It takes the current canvas as input at each time step and decides whether to stop drawing or output a stroke program to keep drawing. 

- It is trained via reinforcement learning, using different reward functions for unconditional character generation vs parsing/reconstruction tasks.

- It does not require any vector/stroke-level supervision, only raster images. 

2. Demonstrating that the parsing agent can be used for exemplar generation and type-conditioned concept generation without any further training, by exploiting the learned compositionality.

3. Achieving unconditional generation, parsing, exemplar generation, and type-conditioned concept generation on MNIST and Omniglot datasets using the proposed approach. The method is the first self-supervised stroke-based approach to accomplish all of these tasks.

4. Providing quantitative benchmarks on the exemplar and type-conditioned concept generation tasks using perceptual similarity metrics like LPIPS, which has not been done before.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel self-supervised stroke-based agent that can handle multiple generation tasks, and demonstrating its capabilities on standard datasets while also providing new quantitative evaluations. The main advantage is learning stroke-level representations without needing vector supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a drawing agent that can generate novel handwritten characters through stroke-based vector representations in a completely self-supervised manner, without requiring any vector-level supervision, and shows successful results on unconditional generation, parsing/reconstruction, exemplar generation, and type-conditioned generation tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here are some key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents a novel stroke-based drawing agent for character generation and parsing tasks. Other recent work like SPIRAL, Sketch-RNN, Sketchformer operate on the stroke level as well, but rely on stroke-level supervision during training. This paper's approach is self-supervised and only uses raster images, making it more widely applicable.

- For the character parsing (reconstruction) task, the paper shows competitive quantitative results to other self-supervised approaches like SPIRAL and Learning to Paint. However, those methods focused mainly on parsing, while this paper tackles multiple generation tasks in addition to parsing.

- For unconditional character generation, the paper shows MNIST samples that seem on par with other GAN methods like WGAN in terms of visual quality. The FID score is reasonable but not state-of-the-art. For Omniglot, the generations demonstrate diversity and conform to alphabet styles, unlike previous models.

- This is the first stroke-based method that achieves exemplar generation and type-conditioned concept generation on Omniglot in a self-supervised manner. Prior Bayesian program learning models required stroke supervision for these tasks. Quantitative metrics are provided for the first time.

- Compared to raster-based Omniglot models like DRAW, this method better captures the compositional structure of characters and generates interpretable programs. But one-step raster models can generate higher visual fidelity currently.

In summary, the key novelty is the self-supervised stroke-based approach, which expands the capability of character generation and parsing models to be applicable to datasets without stroke labels. Both qualitative results and benchmarking metrics are provided demonstrating these capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring the application of their self-supervised vectorization approach to natural images, not just handwritten characters. The authors note that their method has so far only been tested on MNIST and Omniglot datasets of handwritten characters, not more complex natural images.

- Enhancing the stroke representations to capture more complex structures beyond just quadratic Bezier curves. The authors state that for "human-level generations", more sophisticated stroke representations will likely be needed.

- Incorporating more intelligent stopping criteria, beyond just a binary "stop/continue" decision at each timestep. The authors suggest having a more nuanced stopping approach could improve results.

- Extending the method to text generation tasks like handwriting synthesis, since their approach operates at the stroke level. The sequential nature of their method seems applicable to generating longer sequences like handwritten text.

- Exploring conditional and controllable generation in more depth, like class-conditional generation. The authors were able to do type/alphabet conditional generation in a basic way but suggest more complex conditional settings could be interesting to explore.

- Applying their self-supervised vectorization approach to other structured prediction tasks like program synthesis, CAD design, etc. The authors suggest their method of learning to generate stroke programs could generalize.

In summary, the main directions are exploring more complex images and stroke representations, more sophisticated stopping criteria, text generation tasks, conditional generation, and applying the vectorization approach to other structured prediction domains. The authors lay out a promising research agenda building on their self-supervised stroke-based generation method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a drawing agent that operates on stroke-level representations of images for character generation and parsing. The agent takes in a canvas image, decides whether to stop or continue drawing, and if continuing, outputs a program specifying the stroke to draw. It is trained via reinforcement learning on the MNIST and Omniglot datasets for unconditional generation and parsing tasks. The parsing agent is then used for exemplar generation and type conditioned concept generation on Omniglot without additional training. The agent successfully generates novel characters unconditionally, conditioned on a given alphabet, and conditioned on a given character exemplar. It also successfully parses input characters into strokes in a minimal number of actions. A key contribution is the fully self-supervised training process requiring only raster images, without any stroke-level supervision. Results demonstrate the agent's ability to learn effective stroke-based generation policies from raster images alone across multiple generation tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a drawing agent that operates on stroke-level representations of images for character generation and parsing. The agent takes in a canvas image at each time step and decides whether to stop drawing or output a program indicating the stroke to be drawn next. For unconditional character generation, the agent is trained via reinforcement learning to generate novel characters that fool a discriminator and conform to the overall dataset statistics. For parsing/reconstruction, the agent is trained to reconstruct a given character using as few strokes as possible. The parsing agent can then be used for exemplar generation of a given character and type-conditional generation without any further training. 

Experiments demonstrate successful unconditional generation on MNIST and Omniglot datasets. The parsing agent is able to reconstruct characters it has not seen before, indicating it has learned a general vectorization process. The parsing agent generates convincing exemplars of novel characters by sampling multiple stroke sets from its policy distribution. For type-conditional generation, it composes a stroke library by parsing example characters, then samples strokes from this library to generate compelling novel characters matching the type structure. The agent solves all generation tasks in a completely self-supervised manner, using only raster images as training data. Key advantages are capturing stroke-level structure and avoiding blurriness common in raster-based generative models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for stroke-based image generation and parsing. The method uses an agent that operates on a stroke-level vector representation of images. At each time step, the agent takes in the current canvas image and outputs a distribution over possible strokes to draw next, along with a distribution for deciding whether to stop drawing or continue. The stroke parameters are randomly sampled from the distribution and rendered on the canvas if the "continue" decision is made. This process repeats until a "stop" decision is sampled, finalizing the output image. The agent is trained using policy gradient methods, with different reward functions formulated for unconditional generation and parsing tasks. For generation, the reward promotes realism and conformity to the training set statistics. For parsing, it promotes reconstructing the target image using minimal strokes. Without any further training, the parsing network can also be used for exemplar generation and class-conditional generation by appropriately manipulating its outputs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to generate characters and sketches in a vector/stroke-based manner without requiring direct supervision of the stroke information. 

Some key aspects:

- Most prior work on sketch/character generation uses raster representations and generates the image in one step rather than through a sequence of stroke actions. This makes the generation process less interpretable and doesn't leverage the simplicity and quality of vector graphics. 

- Some prior work has used stroke-level supervision directly, but this type of labeling is expensive. This paper aims to learn from raster images only.

- The paper presents a model based on reinforcement learning that sequentially decides whether to stop or draw the next stroke. The stroke to draw is parameterized as a Bezier curve.

- The model is trained on unconditional generation of characters as well as reconstructing/parsing characters into strokes.

- The parsing model is shown to be useful for exemplar generation and type-conditional generation without any further training.

So in summary, the key focus is achieving vector-based sequential character generation without direct stroke supervision, by framing it as a reinforcement learning problem. The self-supervised vectorization aspect and application to multiple generative tasks seem to be the main novel contributions.
