## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "SpeechX: Neural Codec Language Model as a Versatile Speech Transformer":

The paper proposes SpeechX, a versatile speech generation model that can handle multiple audio-text-based speech tasks including text-to-speech, noise suppression, speech removal, target speaker extraction, and speech editing. SpeechX is based on a neural codec language model using Transformers. It generates a sequence of neural codes (acoustic tokens) conditioned on textual and acoustic prompts. To enable handling diverse tasks, task-dependent tokens are incorporated into the acoustic prompt in a multi-task learning framework to specify which task to execute. The textual prompt provides semantic information in the form of phonemes. The acoustic prompt encodes the input audio into a sequence of acoustic tokens using a neural codec encoder. The output token sequence represents the desired audio signal for the specified task. SpeechX is first pretrained on only text-to-speech data and then trained on all tasks. The simple architecture allows incorporating new tasks by adding task tokens and training on additional data.
