# [Self-supervised Learning for Large-scale Item Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12865)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research goal of this paper is to develop a self-supervised learning framework to improve item representation learning and recommendation performance, especially for items with sparse labeled data. The key hypothesis is that by introducing auxiliary self-supervised tasks through data augmentation and contrastive learning, the model can learn better latent relationships between item features and alleviate the label sparsity problem. This should lead to better item representations and improved recommendation performance.Specifically, the paper aims to address the following research questions:- RQ1: Does the proposed SSL framework improve deep models for recommendations?- RQ2: What is the impact of training data amount on the improvement from SSL? - RQ3: How do the SSL parameters affect model quality?- RQ4: How does the proposed Correlated Feature Masking (CFM) perform compared to simpler masking strategies?The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSL framework, show its benefits especially with sparse labeled data, analyze the impact of key hyperparameters, and justify the design choices like using CFM.In summary, the central hypothesis is that self-supervision through data augmentation and contrastive learning can alleviate label sparsity and improve item representation learning for large-scale recommender systems. The paper aims to propose and evaluate an SSL framework tailored for sparse categorical input features commonly used in recommenders.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to improve item representation learning for large-scale recommender systems, especially for items with sparse labels (e.g. long-tail items). The key ideas are:- Proposing a model architecture agnostic SSL framework that introduces an auxiliary SSL task on unlabeled data to regularize the main supervised task. The SSL task relies on a novel data augmentation technique and contrastive loss.- Introducing a two-stage data augmentation technique tailored for sparse categorical features in recommenders: it first masks features based on their correlation, then applies feature dropout. - Demonstrating the proposed SSL framework improves performance over state-of-the-art regularization techniques like spread-out regularization, especially for tail items and slices with sparse labels.- Conducting offline experiments on two large datasets showing SSL consistently outperforms baselines. The improvements are more significant when training data is sparse.- Launching the techniques in a web-scale recommender system and showing significant gains on key metrics in online A/B tests, verifying the effectiveness in real production systems.In summary, the main contribution is proposing an SSL framework along with tailored data augmentations to improve item representation learning and generalization of recommender systems, especially for tail items. This is demonstrated through extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests.
