# [MST-compression: Compressing and Accelerating Binary Neural Networks   with Minimum Spanning Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we compress and accelerate binary neural networks (BNNs) while maintaining accuracy? The key points are:- BNNs use 1-bit representations for weights and activations, which greatly reduces computational cost and memory storage compared to full-precision networks. However, as networks get deeper and wider, the computational burden remains challenging even for BNNs.- The paper proposes a new method called "MST compression" to compress and accelerate BNNs by reordering the calculation of output channels in binary convolutional layers. - The method is based on constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST) over the output channels, where edge distances represent the number of different weight values between two channels. The MST provides an optimal order to reuse output calculations and minimize total operations.- They also propose a learning algorithm to optimize the MST during training by minimizing the total edge distances, further improving compression ratio. - Experiments on benchmark models like VGG and ResNets demonstrate significant compression and acceleration over baselines with minimal accuracy loss.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using MST compression can effectively reduce computation and memory costs for BNNs while maintaining accuracy, enabling their deployment on resource-constrained devices. The paper presents a method and experiments to validate this hypothesis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in compressing and accelerating binary neural networks:- The main novelty of this paper is using minimum spanning trees (MSTs) to optimize the order of calculations in binary convolution layers. Previous works like Fu et al. and Vo et al. used methods like k-means clustering and shortest Hamiltonian paths, but the authors argue MSTs are more effective at minimizing computations.- For learning optimization during training, the paper proposes a method to minimize the MST distance/depth by clustering weight sets and optimizing their distances to fixed centers. This is a new technique aimed at maximizing compression ratio. - The results show impressive compression ratios compared to prior art, reducing parameters by up to 13.5x and bit operations by 5.51x with minimal accuracy loss. This suggests MSTs are an effective compression technique.- The paper demonstrates a complete pipeline from learning to hardware acceleration. Most prior work focuses only on one aspect. The FPGA implementation shows 1.8x LUT savings versus a baseline architecture.- Compared to the SNN paper, this approach achieves higher compression ratios and accuracy on several models. The differences highlight the advantages of MSTs over the scattered kernel method used in SNN.Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in BNN compression by introducing MSTs for calculation ordering. The learning optimization and hardware acceleration also help validate MSTs as an effective compression technique across the full pipeline. The results improve over both prior BNN compression methods and hardware accelerators.
