# [Composite Survival Analysis: Learning with Auxiliary Aggregated   Baselines and Survival Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Survival analysis is used to predict time to an event of interest (e.g. patient mortality, customer conversion, machine failure). It faces challenges like right-censoring when participants leave the study early. 
- Existing methods either focus only on time-to-event relationship or overall predictive accuracy. They don't produce survival probabilities for each participant. 
- Many methods are computationally demanding, require fine-tuning, or time-consuming MCMC.

Proposed Solution:
- Decompose survival function into two components:
    1) Aggregated baseline hazard: Captures overall survival behavior of a population. Handles right-censoring.
    2) Survival scores: Capture idiosyncratic probabilistic dynamics of individual members. Independent of baseline hazard.
- Baseline Hazard:
    - Uses Bayesian approach to estimate hazard rate at each time interval based on covariates
    - Assumes covariates are independent and normally distributed
    - Recursively updates posterior distribution as prior for next time step
    - Produces baseline survival function
- Survival Scores:
    - Learned by fitting binary classifier on training data without time covariate
    - Proposition: Classifier weights dot product with new sample gives distinct survival scores
    - Scores scaled to match baseline hazard 
    - Combined with baseline hazard to produce individual survival curves

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework to decompose survival function into baseline and individual components
- Bayesian approach to estimate parametric baseline hazard 
- Methodology to derive distinct survival scores for each member
- Computationally efficient, requires little tuning
- Flexible framework, allows experimenting with different baseline hazards or score models
- Achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods
