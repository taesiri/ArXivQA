# [Debiased Novel Category Discovering and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing object detection models perform well only on closed-set datasets with a fixed set of categories. They fail to detect novel objects not present in the training set, either identifying them as background or misclassifying them into known categories. The paper focuses on the challenging problem of Novel Class Discovery and Localization (NCDL) to train detectors that can not only detect known categories but also actively discover, localize and cluster novel unseen categories.

Proposed Solution:
The authors identify core issues with current NCDL methods - they are biased towards seen categories, neglecting discovery of novel objects. To address this, they propose:

1) Debiased Region Mining (DRM) using a complementary class-agnostic and class-aware Region Proposal Network (RPN) to reduce localization bias and discover more potential objects.

2) Semi-supervised contrastive learning on unlabeled data to improve feature representations and differentiate between known and novel classes. 

3) Simple mini-batch K-means clustering for novel category discovery by over-clustering to improve purity.

Main Contributions:

- Identify and address bias problem in existing NCDL methods towards seen categories
- Propose DRM for improved localization of both known and novel objects  
- Suggest semi-supervised contrastive learning to reduce feature bias
- Establish new state-of-the-art results on NCDL benchmark through extensive experiments

In summary, the paper presents effective techniques to reduce bias for novel category discovery and localization in an open-world setting, outperforming previous methods significantly.
