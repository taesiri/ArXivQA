# [SmartControl: Enhancing ControlNet for Handling Rough Visual Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing layout-controllable text-to-image (T2I) models like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter require precise visual conditions (e.g. segmentation masks, depth maps) that align with the text prompt. However, preparing such precise conditions is difficult for ordinary users. Instead, users often provide "rough" visual conditions extracted from cheap analogies or sketches, which may not align precisely with the text prompt or user's intentions. Existing models strictly follow these rough conditions, leading to unrealistic results with artifacts. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes "SmartControl", a flexible T2I generation method that can handle rough visual conditions. The key idea is to relax the constraints of the visual conditions in areas that conflict with the text prompt. Specifically,

1) A Control Scale Predictor (CSP) is designed to identify conflict regions between conditions and prompts, and predict local control scales based on the degree of conflict.

2) A dataset containing text prompts and unaligned rough conditions is constructed to train the CSP. The training data is generated by iterating over different control scales of ControlNet.

3) The predicted local control scales are used to relax the fusion of conditions in conflict regions while preserving useful constraints elsewhere. This allows generating images faithful to text prompts under rough conditions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes SmartControl, the first automated method to handle rough visual conditions for controllable T2I generation. Allows creating user's imagined scenes from cheap analogies/sketches.

- Designs a Control Scale Predictor to identify condition-prompt conflicts and predict adaptive control scales. Enhances text-image alignment.

- Constructs a dataset of text prompts and unaligned rough conditions for training. Shows good generalization to unseen objects with only 1,000-2,000 samples.

- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-arts in quantitative metrics and user studies. Allows accurate and flexible controllable generation.
