# [Is Translation All You Need? A Study on Solving Multilingual Tasks with   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10258)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on non-English tasks is important but challenging. Directly evaluating LLMs on non-English benchmarks may not fully reveal model capabilities due to limited multilinguality. 

- Translating non-English inputs into English is a simple strategy to leverage the English-centric nature of many LLMs, but risks losing cultural nuances. It's unclear if translation helps for real-world user queries across diverse languages.

Methodology:
- Evaluate 6 LLMs (including ChatGPT) on 6 multilingual NLP benchmarks with 8 prompting strategies involving combinations of native instructions, English instructions, chain-of-thought reasoning, and input translation.

- Test ChatGPT and Llama on real user queries from 10 languages in ShareGPT dataset. Judge quality of responses using GPT-4-Turbo and analyze necessity of cultural knowledge.  

- Further investigate 4 models on Mandarin exam questions requiring cultural understanding.

Key Findings:
- Translating non-English inputs to English with Google Translate surprisingly works best across benchmarks and models. Models reliant on English like Llama benefit more than ChatGPT.  

- For real user queries, ChatGPT favors native languages for high-resource but benefits from translation for low-resource languages. Llama prefers translation for all languages.

- 18-50% of real user queries require cultural knowledge. ChatGPT demonstrates promise in handling cultural nuances for some languages, while other models struggle without native language training.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of translation techniques for evaluating LLMs on diverse multilingual tasks and real-world queries.

- Reveal strengths and weaknesses of models in retaining meaning and cultural context when using translation. 

- Show translation can be highly effective but has limitations compared to native language training, especially for capturing cultural elements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores various prompting strategies for handling non-English tasks across multiple languages and models, finding translation into English consistently effective yet imperfect, with performance dependent on translation quality and models' linguistic capacities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an empirical analysis evaluating the effectiveness of translating non-English input queries into English as a strategy for improving the performance of large language models on multilingual tasks. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Tests various prompting strategies involving translation (e.g. using Google Translate or the NLLB model) across 6 multilingual NLP benchmarks and several state-of-the-art LLMs.

- Finds that translating input queries into English consistently delivers good performance across models and tasks, although it is not always the single best approach.

- Evaluates performance on real-world user queries extracted from ShareGPT datasets in 10 languages and shows translation helps more for lower-resource languages and English-centric models.  

- Analyzes the cultural elements present in the real-world queries, showing translation's limitations in capturing cultural nuances.

- Conducts further analysis using multilingual benchmarks to demonstrate that directly training models in specific languages can outperform translation for languages the model specializes in.

In summary, the key contribution is a thorough empirical evaluation of translation as a strategy for handling multilingual tasks, analyzing its strengths, limitations, and differences across models. The paper provides guidance on when translation is most effective and when native language training is preferable.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Multilingual language models
- Prompting strategies
- Translation
- Cross-lingual understanding
- Low-resource languages
- High-resource languages

The paper explores different prompting strategies like native instructions, English instructions, chain-of-thought, translation with Google Translate or NLLB models for multilingual NLP tasks. It analyzes the performance of models like ChatGPT and Llama on benchmarks and real user queries in high and low resource languages. It also examines if translation helps for cultural knowledge and compares models in handling multilingual and culture-specific queries.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares several prompting strategies like native chain-of-thought and cross-lingual-thought. What are the key differences between these strategies and what are their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

2. When using translation, this paper experiments with both Google Translate and NLLB models. What factors contribute to the quality of translation for the task of querying large language models? How could translation be further improved?

3. For the real user queries experiment, what criteria were used to determine if a response required knowledge of local culture? Could this determination be automated or improved in some way? 

4. When analyzing the real user queries, there is significant variation in the percentage of questions requiring local knowledge across languages. What factors might contribute to this variation? Is it possible to predict which types of questions will require more cultural context?

5. The paper hypothesizes that the Llama model is more English-centric while ChatGPT demonstrates broader linguistic capacity. What evidence from the experiments supports these characterizations? What specifically makes ChatGPT more adaptable across languages?  

6. For the M3Exam cultural knowledge experiment, why does translation negatively impact performance for some models but helps others? What prevents translation from being universally beneficial?

7. What types of translation errors are most detrimental when querying large language models? How can these specific issues be addressed to make translation more robust?

8. The paper argues translation can enable better comprehension by some models, but risks losing nuanced cultural meaning. How might this tradeoff be quantified or optimized in future work?

9. Besides accuracy, what other evaluation metrics could be used to assess performance on multilingual queries? Are there ways to directly measure cultural appropriateness or nuanced understanding?

10. How do the trends and results found in these experiments extend to languages beyond the 24 tested? What new issues or phenomena might emerge with very low-resource languages?
