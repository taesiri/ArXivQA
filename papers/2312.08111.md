# [Towards Better Morphed Face Images without Ghosting Artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08111)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to prevent ghosting artifacts in automatically generated morphed face images, which are created by blending facial images of different subjects. The proposed method performs pixel-wise alignment to map similar facial structures (e.g. iris border, nostrils) to the same shape and position in the input images before blending. This prevents ghosting artifacts in the resulting morphed image. Experiments show that morphed images improved with the proposed method, especially when combined with a previous style transfer-based improvement approach, are significantly harder to detect for state-of-the-art single-image morphing attack detectors while still impersonating both subjects. The detectors can adapt to these improved attacks when examples are added to the training set, but still perform worse compared to detecting simpler morphing attacks. Additionally, the proposed pixel-wise alignment works for any image resolution, unlike GAN-based morphing approaches which are limited. By automatically generating high-quality and challenging morphed facial images, the proposed approach enables more robust evaluation and development of morphing attack detection techniques.
