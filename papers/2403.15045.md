# [DP-Dueling: Learning from Preference Feedback without Compromising User   Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of dueling bandits under differential privacy constraints. Dueling bandits is an active learning framework where the learner aims to find the best action/item by actively choosing pairs of items and asking for user preference feedback between them. The key challenge is how to provide privacy guarantees for the sensitive user preferences while still allowing the learner to effectively minimize regret and find the optimal items. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes differentially private dueling bandit algorithms for both finite and infinite/continuous action spaces. The main ideas involve:

(1) For finite action spaces, an elimination-style algorithm that estimates the reward of each arm privately using a binary tree mechanism, plays arms in a round-robin fashion to get unbiased estimates, eliminates suboptimal arms using confidence bounds on the estimates.

(2) For infinite action spaces, an elimination algorithm using the idea of G-optimal coresets to construct a representative subset, privately estimating rewards of items using maximum likelihood on the coreset, and eliminating suboptimal items based on optimistic estimates. 

Key Contributions:

- Formal definition of the differentially private dueling bandits (DP-DB) problem combining privacy and preference learning.

- Optimal DP algorithm for finite action spaces achieving $\tilde{O}(\sum_i \log(T)/\Delta_i + K/\epsilon)$ regret with $\epsilon$-differential privacy. Matches lower bounds in both privacy and learning.

- Algorithm for infinite dimensional action spaces achieving $\tilde{O}(d^6/(\kappa\epsilon) + d\sqrt{T}/\kappa)$ regret under $\epsilon$-DP. Gets privacy for free in the regime $T \gg d$.

- Lower bound result proving fundamental limits of private dueling bandits.

The paper provides the first theoretical guarantees for differentially private dueling bandits, with near optimal algorithms and lower bounds. It opens promising directions at the intersection of preferences, active learning and privacy.
