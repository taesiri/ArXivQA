## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Squeeze-and-Excitation Convolutional Neural Network (SECNN) for sentence classification. The model introduces a channel attention mechanism, called the SE attention mechanism, to re-weight the feature maps generated by multiple CNNs without requiring additional parameters. Specifically, the feature maps from the CNN blocks are treated as different "channels" representing the sentence. A squeeze operation generates channel-wise statistics by global average pooling. An excite operation captures channel-wise dependencies through a gating mechanism to output attention weights for each channel. These weights are then used to re-scale the channels. Experiments on four sentence classification datasets demonstrate that SECNN outperforms several competitive baseline methods on two of the datasets. The results are further improved by using pre-trained word vectors like Word2Vec and GloVe. Overall, the paper shows that channel-wise attention can effectively improve sentence classification performance by learning to focus on the most informative feature maps. Key innovations include introducing channel attention to NLP and treating CNN feature maps as channels for sentences.
