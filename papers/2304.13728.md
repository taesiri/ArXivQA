# [ChatGPT is all you need to decolonize sub-Saharan Vocational Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is:How can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT be leveraged to transform and improve vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa?The paper argues that LLMs present a unique opportunity to modernize and decolonize vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa due to their scalability, accessibility, affordability, ability to personalize learning, and convenience. The authors advocate for an educational policy framework that prioritizes technical and vocational training over traditional academic education, with LLMs tailored to local cultures and needs at the core. The central hypothesis seems to be that implementing such LLM-centered vocational education programs would allow sub-Saharan countries to rapidly upskill their citizens, drive economic development, and systemically decolonize their educational systems by moving away from Eurocentric academic models inherited from colonialism.In essence, the paper aims to make the case that LLMs could revolutionize vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa if policymakers embrace and properly implement this technology. The potential impact on economic mobility and decolonization efforts is the key focus.
