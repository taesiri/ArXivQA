# [ChatGPT is all you need to decolonize sub-Saharan Vocational Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is:How can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT be leveraged to transform and improve vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa?The paper argues that LLMs present a unique opportunity to modernize and decolonize vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa due to their scalability, accessibility, affordability, ability to personalize learning, and convenience. The authors advocate for an educational policy framework that prioritizes technical and vocational training over traditional academic education, with LLMs tailored to local cultures and needs at the core. The central hypothesis seems to be that implementing such LLM-centered vocational education programs would allow sub-Saharan countries to rapidly upskill their citizens, drive economic development, and systemically decolonize their educational systems by moving away from Eurocentric academic models inherited from colonialism.In essence, the paper aims to make the case that LLMs could revolutionize vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa if policymakers embrace and properly implement this technology. The potential impact on economic mobility and decolonization efforts is the key focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a framework for prioritizing technical and vocational education and training (TVET) over academic education in sub-Saharan African countries, by leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key points made are:- LLMs like ChatGPT have potential for scalability, accessibility, affordability, personalization and convenience. This makes them well-suited for adapting and modernizing education in developing countries.- Focusing on TVET rather than academic education fits better with the characteristics of LLMs. TVET has more immediate practical applications, is more distributed, and involves teaching subjects where real-time interaction can improve LLMs. - The paper provides examples of potential LLM applications in TVET, like agricultural training, robotics education, and paramedic training.- Historical examples are given of countries like Greece, South Korea, and Singapore that prioritized TVET over academic education during development, and saw good economic results. This supports prioritizing TVET in sub-Saharan Africa too.- The paper argues this TVET+LLM approach would help African countries "decolonize" their education systems. It would avoid mimicking Western academic institutions and build more culturally relevant education.In summary, the main contribution is proposing an education policy focused on TVET and LLMs as a practical way for sub-Saharan nations to modernize and decolonize their education systems. The potential benefits to development are highlighted.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes using large language models tailored to the cultural backgrounds and needs of sub-Saharan Africa to prioritize vocational and technical training over academic education, arguing this will help decolonize and modernize the educational systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper makes a novel argument for prioritizing technical/vocational education (TVET) over academic education in sub-Saharan Africa. Much existing research focuses more on improving academic institutions rather than vocational training. The historical examples and framing around systemic decolonization seem unique.- The idea of using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for education is very timely given the recent explosion in capabilities and interest in LLMs. However, the specific focus on TVET in sub-Saharan Africa is distinct - most current research is looking at LLMs for more general education purposes.- The paper highlights potential benefits of using LLMs over traditional search engines for providing educational content, especially in incorporating indigenous knowledge. This comparison and emphasis on decolonization sets it apart from papers that simply propose using LLMs for education.- The discussion of potential applications in areas like agriculture, robotics, and paramedic training demonstrates concrete ways LLMs could support TVET. However, these examples are described at a high level compared to papers that provide more technical details on educational applications.- The historical examples from Greece, South Korea, and Singapore provide an interesting backdrop. However, the connections to sub-Saharan Africa today are not explored in much depth.Overall, the focus on using LLMs to transform technical education and decolonize systems in sub-Saharan Africa seems novel compared to other literature. However, the technical details and validation of the approach are limited relative to more applied papers on AI for education. The framing and vision are ambitious, though the specifics need further development.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods to make LLMs more culturally aware and sensitive to local contexts in Sub-Saharan Africa. The authors note the risk that LLMs without sufficient training data relevant to African realities could reinforce colonial ideologies. More work is needed to incorporate African knowledge systems into the training data and fine-tuning of models.- Studying the optimal balance between academic and vocational education. The authors argue for prioritizing vocational education, but recognize academic education also has value. More research could shed light on the right balance for different country contexts. - Improving access to the necessary hardware infrastructure, including high-quality internet connectivity and electricity, to enable widespread adoption of LLMs. The authors recognize this as a limitation of their proposal. Overcoming these infrastructure barriers is critical.- Developing oversight mechanisms and involvement of human experts to monitor and provide guidance to LLMs used in educational contexts. Complete automation is not desirable, human supervision is still important.- Expanding the proposal beyond sub-Saharan Africa. The principles could apply to other developing country contexts, but tailored application is required. Comparative research across countries could be illuminating.- Evaluating the effectiveness of LLM-centric vocational education programs empirically if they are implemented. Rigorous program evaluation would help strengthen the evidence base.- Considering risks and challenges, including issues surrounding data privacy, content moderation, bias and misinformation when using AI systems in education. Responsible development is key.In summary, more interdisciplinary research across technology, education, development studies and beyond is needed to ensure LLMs can be successfully leveraged to equalize access to quality education globally.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an educational policy framework for sub-Saharan African countries that prioritizes vocational and technical training over academic education. It argues that the recent advances in generative AI models like ChatGPT provide a unique opportunity for developing countries to modernize their educational systems in a scalable, accessible, affordable and personalized way. The paper highlights applications of Large Language Models tailored to the cultural contexts of African countries that could reinforce systemic decolonization through technical training focused on agriculture, food, robotics, and paramedical skills. It provides historical examples of countries like Greece, South Korea and Singapore that successfully transformed their economies by prioritizing vocational education and training over traditional academic institutions. The key suggestion is that sub-Saharan African countries should follow this model by putting Large Language Models at the heart of vocational education to equip citizens with immediately applicable skills, rather than mimicking colonial education systems ill-suited to their realities. This bottom-up approach can speed up socioeconomic development.
