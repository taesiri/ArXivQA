# [ChatGPT is all you need to decolonize sub-Saharan Vocational Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is:How can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT be leveraged to transform and improve vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa?The paper argues that LLMs present a unique opportunity to modernize and decolonize vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa due to their scalability, accessibility, affordability, ability to personalize learning, and convenience. The authors advocate for an educational policy framework that prioritizes technical and vocational training over traditional academic education, with LLMs tailored to local cultures and needs at the core. The central hypothesis seems to be that implementing such LLM-centered vocational education programs would allow sub-Saharan countries to rapidly upskill their citizens, drive economic development, and systemically decolonize their educational systems by moving away from Eurocentric academic models inherited from colonialism.In essence, the paper aims to make the case that LLMs could revolutionize vocational education in sub-Saharan Africa if policymakers embrace and properly implement this technology. The potential impact on economic mobility and decolonization efforts is the key focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a framework for prioritizing technical and vocational education and training (TVET) over academic education in sub-Saharan African countries, by leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key points made are:- LLMs like ChatGPT have potential for scalability, accessibility, affordability, personalization and convenience. This makes them well-suited for adapting and modernizing education in developing countries.- Focusing on TVET rather than academic education fits better with the characteristics of LLMs. TVET has more immediate practical applications, is more distributed, and involves teaching subjects where real-time interaction can improve LLMs. - The paper provides examples of potential LLM applications in TVET, like agricultural training, robotics education, and paramedic training.- Historical examples are given of countries like Greece, South Korea, and Singapore that prioritized TVET over academic education during development, and saw good economic results. This supports prioritizing TVET in sub-Saharan Africa too.- The paper argues this TVET+LLM approach would help African countries "decolonize" their education systems. It would avoid mimicking Western academic institutions and build more culturally relevant education.In summary, the main contribution is proposing an education policy focused on TVET and LLMs as a practical way for sub-Saharan nations to modernize and decolonize their education systems. The potential benefits to development are highlighted.
