# [One Graph Model for Cross-domain Dynamic Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to explore foundation models for cross-domain link prediction on dynamic graphs. Link prediction is an important task with many real-world applications, but most existing methods are limited to single datasets. The goal is to train one model on multiple dynamic graphs across domains that can generalize to new unseen graphs without additional training. This is challenging because graphs from different domains have distinct meanings and evolution patterns.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DyExpert, a transformer-based model that explicitly captures the evolution patterns of graphs for link prediction. DyExpert is trained by a novel conditioned link generation (CLG) approach that integrates modeling graph evolution and link prediction into one coherent sequence modeling task. Specifically, CLG samples evolution sequences from graph history to predict future links in a chronological order, with all predictions conditioned on previous ones. This allows DyExpert to learn evolution similarities across domains. DyExpert also employs time augmentation and normalization for better transferability.

For efficient inference, DyExpert caches computation results related to evolution modeling and only calculates node representations for each specific prediction. This reduces inference time complexity to O(1) for each prediction.

Contributions:
- Pioneers the exploration of foundation models for cross-domain link prediction to benefit diverse applications
- Proposes DyExpert, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by explicitly modeling graph evolution 
- Develops conditioned link generation for integrating evolution modeling and link prediction
- Conducts comprehensive experiments on 14 datasets to provide valuable insights

Key Results:
- DyExpert outperforms baselines by 11.4% on average across 8 unseen graphs
- Surpasses supervised performance of 8 advanced models on 6 unseen graphs 
- Detailed analysis validates DyExpert's ability of learning evolution patterns
- Exhibits potential for continued model scaling using more data

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards building foundation models for dynamic graph link prediction via evolution modeling. The proposed DyExpert demonstrates strong empirical performance and transferability across domains.
