# [EfficientSAM: Leveraged Masked Image Pretraining for Efficient Segment   Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance for zero-shot transfer and high versatility on vision tasks like segmentation. However, the huge model size (636M parameters) and computation cost limit its practical applications. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose EfficientSAMs, lightweight SAM models with decent performance and largely reduced complexity. 
- Present SAM-leveraged Masked Image Pretraining (SAMI) to learn lightweight image encoders that can reconstruct features from SAM encoder. This transfers SAM's knowledge to the encoders.
- Take SAMI-pretrained lightweight encoders as image encoder in SAM framework and finetune on segmentation dataset to build efficient SAM models.

Main Contributions:

- Propose SAMI pretraining method that outperforms masked image pretraining baselines by leveraging feature reconstruction from SAM encoder.

- Demonstrate SAMI-pretrained backbones generalize well to tasks like classification, detection, segmentation with improved performance, especially for smaller models. 

- Deliver EfficientSAMs that achieve state-of-the-art trade-offs between quality and efficiency. On instance segmentation, EfficientSAMs outperform recent lightweight SAM models by ~4 AP while having comparable model complexity.

- EfficientSAM with SAMI-pretrained ViT-Small reduces inference time and model size of SAM by ~20x with small performance drop. This makes EfficientSAMs suitable for practical applications.

In summary, the paper presents an effective SAMI pretraining approach to learn lightweight encoders for building efficient SAM models that have significantly lower complexity than SAM while maintaining decent performance. The proposed EfficientSAMs can enable wider deployment of SAM technology.
