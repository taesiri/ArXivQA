# [A Benchmark for Chinese-English Scene Text Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03262)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces a new dataset and method for scene text image super-resolution, with a particular focus on improving performance on Chinese text images. The key contributions are:1. A new Chinese-English scene text image dataset called Real-CE, containing high-resolution and low-resolution image pairs with detailed annotations. This provides a benchmark for training and evaluating super-resolution models on complex Chinese text. 2. An edge-aware learning method to improve super-resolution of Chinese text images. This uses Canny edge detection to extract text structure information, and incorporates edge map inputs and losses to help the model focus on reconstructing finer text details and strokes.3. Experiments demonstrating superior performance on Chinese text super-resolution using Real-CE compared to existing datasets, and improved results from the proposed edge-aware training approach.In summary, the central hypotheses are:- Existing English-focused scene text datasets are insufficient for complex Chinese text super-resolution. - Leveraging explicit edge information can help super-resolution models better reconstruct the intricate structures in Chinese characters.The Real-CE dataset and edge-aware method aim to address these limitations. The experiments support the hypothesis that they improve performance on challenging Chinese text super-resolution compared to prior training data and methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A new real-world Chinese-English benchmark dataset (termed Real-CE) for scene text image super-resolution (STISR), which contains 1,935 training image pairs and 783 testing image pairs with a total of 33,789 text lines. Out of these, 24,666 are Chinese text lines with complex structures. 2. A new evaluation protocol tailored for this benchmark that avoids resizing text lines before evaluation, preserving text quality better.3. An edge-aware learning method to enhance STISR model's ability to reconstruct complex Chinese characters. This uses the text edge map as input and incorporates an edge-aware loss at both pixel and feature levels. 4. Experiments showing models trained on Real-CE outperform those trained on other datasets like TextZoom and RealSR. The edge-aware learning further improves performance, especially on reconstructing Chinese texts.In summary, the key contributions are a new challenging benchmark for STISR focused on Chinese text, a customized evaluation protocol, and a novel edge-aware learning technique to handle complex Chinese characters better. The benchmark and techniques help advance research on STISR for languages with intricate character structures like Chinese.
