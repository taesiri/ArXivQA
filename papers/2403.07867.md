# [The Virtues of Laziness: Multi-Query Kinodynamic Motion Planning with   Lazy Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07867)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Kinodynamic motion planning is challenging as it requires simultaneously exploring the robot's state space (positions, velocities etc.) and control space (set of feasible control actions). Existing methods either use sequential approaches which can result in inefficient, infeasible plans or interleaved approaches which are mostly single-query in nature i.e. the search tree needs to be reconstructed for every new query leading to high computational costs. The paper aims to develop an efficient multi-query kinodynamic motion planning algorithm.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents "LazyBoE", a multi-query kinodynamic planning algorithm based on the bundle of edges (BoE) framework. The key ideas are:

1) Efficiently explore state and control spaces by generating a bundle of edges (Î•) using varying control sequences applied to random states. This discrete approximation can be reused across queries.

2) Introduce "lazy" collision checking and propagation by perturbing start states of edges to estimate: i) end-state error bounds i.e. probability of valid lazy propagation (P_lazy_prop), ii) collision probability (P_collision). These drive lazy exploration.

3) LazyBoE planner that uses the above to probabilistically choose whether to lazily reuse prior edges or do full propagation/collision checking. This reduces computations. Additional heuristics identify when to stop lazy search.  

Main Contributions:

1) Method to generate state and control space rollouts for efficient multi-query planning

2) Novel lazy propagation and collision checking techniques for reduced simulation and collision checking costs

3) LazyBoE planner that combines the above for fast, reliable multi-query kinodynamic planning with performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
