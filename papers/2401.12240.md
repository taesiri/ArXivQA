# [Quantised Neural Network Accelerators for Low-Power IDS in Automotive   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In-vehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN) lack inherent security mechanisms and are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are needed to detect such attacks.  
- Integrating machine learning based IDS on ECUs is challenging due to computational requirements and inference latency of ML models. Dedicated hardware like GPUs incur significant power and integration complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- A quantised Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model as IDS accelerator integrated on an FPGA-based ECU architecture. 
- Leverages Xilinx's FINN framework to quantise, train and generate hardware IP from PyTorch MLP model.
- Model trained on CAR Hacking dataset to detect Denial of Service (DoS) and Fuzzing attacks on CAN. 
- 4-bit uniform quantisation chosen for best accuracy-resource tradeoff.
- Integrated as custom IP in Zynq Ultrascale+ and interfaced via Linux drivers for testing.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves 0.12ms per-frame inference latency with near line-rate throughput, 4.8x faster than prior arts.
- Consumes only 0.25mJ per inference, significantly lower than GPUs/CPU solutions.
- Matches state-of-the-art accuracy (99.99% F1 score on DoS detection) with 4-bit quantisation.
- Demonstrates feasibility of ML-based IDS integration in ECUs with minimal overheads.

In summary, the paper presents a novel quantised MLP accelerator for CAN network IDS with improved latency, energy efficiency and ease of integration while preserving high threat detection accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores a quantized neural network accelerator integrated into an automotive ECU for low-power intrusion detection on controller area networks, achieving high throughput and low latency at significantly reduced energy consumption compared to GPU-based approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The development and evaluation of a low-power custom quantised Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is integrated into an automotive Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Specifically:

- They utilize the FINN framework to quantize, train, and generate hardware IP for an MLP that detects denial of service (DoS) and fuzzying attacks on a CAN network. 

- The MLP is integrated into a Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA that serves as an ECU with integrated IDS capabilities. This allows IDS inference acceleration while minimizing space, wiring, and power consumption.

- Their approach achieves high classification performance in detecting attacks, with 0.12 ms per-message processing latency and 0.25 mJ per inference energy consumption. This is 4.8x lower latency and 36x lower energy than other approaches.

- The integrated IDS consumes less than 4% of FPGA resources, allowing multiple models to be deployed for comprehensive IDS protection.

In summary, the key contribution is an integrated, high-performance, low-power MLP accelerator for real-time IDS on automotive networks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using quantization-aware training with Brevitas to arrive at the 4-bit quantization level for the MLP models. What considerations went into exploring the design space to arrive at this quantization level? What tradeoffs exist between higher and lower bitwidths?

2. The threat models considered in this work are denial of service and fuzzying attacks. What other kinds of attacks could this IDS potentially detect? Would the same MLP architecture work or would modifications be needed?

3. The paper compares classification performance against other ML-based IDS techniques. How does the performance compare against rule-based or anomaly detection based techniques? What are the relative advantages/disadvantages?

4. The coupled accelerator approach allows the IDS to leverage the existing ECU platform. What modifications or considerations went into the software stack to enable this integration? How does it compare to a dedicated IDS platform?

5. What mechanisms are used to ensure real-time detection given the hard latency constraints of an automotive system? How are worst case execution times analyzed for the IDS accelerator?

6. The paper quotes energy numbers for the coupled accelerator. What is the breakdown in terms of static vs dynamic power? Where do opportunities exist to further reduce power?

7. What safety considerations need to be analyzed before deploying such an ML-based IDS in a safety-critical system like a vehicle? How can certification requirements be met?

8. The threat models considered are restricted dataset. How will the IDS perform against zero-day attacks or evolving attack methods? What provisions exist for retraining/updating the models?

9. What changes would be needed in the automotive network architecture or protocols to take protective action based on the IDS detections? 

10. The paper focuses on CAN networks. What considerations would change if applying this IDS accelerator approach for other in-vehicle networks like FlexRay, LIN or Ethernet AVB/TSN?
