# [HILL: Hierarchy-aware Information Lossless Contrastive Learning for   Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17307)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing self-supervised methods for hierarchical text classification (HTC) rely on human-designed data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive samples. However, data augmentation can potentially corrupt or distort the original information in the text. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an information lossless contrastive learning framework called HILL for HTC. The key ideas are:

1) Extract essential syntactic information from the label hierarchy using a structural entropy minimization algorithm to construct optimal coding trees. This reveals the inherent structure of the hierarchy to support semantic analysis.

2) Design a structure encoder that performs hierarchical representation learning on the coding trees to inject structural information into the text embeddings generated by BERT.

3) Generate contrastive samples by fusing syntactic information from the structure encoder with the semantic information from BERT, without needing to augment the original text.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose algorithms guided by structural entropy principles to extract syntactic information from label hierarchies.

2) Design an information lossless contrastive learning framework HILL that fuses syntactic and semantic information without corrupting the original text.

3) Formally define information lossless learning for HTC and prove that HILL retains the maximal mutual information between inputs and targets, which is the upper bound compared to any data augmentation method.

4) Extensive experiments showing HILL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark HTC datasets. For example, it achieves 1.85% and 3.38% average gains in Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 over BERT.

In summary, the paper addresses limitations of existing contrastive learning methods for HTC by developing an information lossless framework HILL that effectively encodes syntactic structure and semantic content for superior performance.
