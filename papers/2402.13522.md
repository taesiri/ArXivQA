# [RecMind: Japanese Movie Recommendation Dialogue with Seeker's Internal   State](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13522)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In dialogues, it's important to estimate the interlocutor's internal state like their knowledge level and interests. This is especially crucial in recommendation dialogues where the recommender needs to understand the seeker's preferences. 
- However, there are no existing datasets with annotations of the seeker's internal state in recommendation dialogues to enable analysis and modeling of this aspect.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a new Japanese movie recommendation dialogue dataset called RecMind, with annotations of the seeker's knowledge level and interest for entities at a fine-grained level. 
- Each entity has subjective labels from the seeker's perspective and objective labels from the recommender's perspective. 
- The dialogues in RecMind feature long utterances from seekers, allowing detailed analysis of their internal state.

Key Findings:
- Entities that seekers don't have knowledge about but are interested in contribute positively to recommendation success.
- The authors propose a framework to generate responses by estimating the seeker's internal state using the dataset. Experiments show it improves consistency and recommendation success over baselines.

Main Contributions:
- Release of RecMind, the first recommendation dialogue dataset with annotations of the seeker's internal state.
- Analysis showing importance of topics seekers lack knowledge of but are interested in.
- Proposed response generation framework that explicitly models the seeker's internal state.
