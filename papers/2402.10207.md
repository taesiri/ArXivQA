# [Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with   Dynamic Preference Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Multi-objective alignment of large foundation models with diverse and potentially conflicting human preferences is challenging. Methods like multi-objective reinforcement learning from human feedback (MORLHF) are costly and unstable. 

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the foundation model's responses on multiple reward values provided in the prompt context. RiC has three main components:

1) Offline training: Apply multi-reward conditional supervised fine-tuning on the dataset to teach the model to ground its responses to different rewards.

2) Online training: Generate additional data near the empirical Pareto front using the offline trained model. Then filter and fine-tune on this augmented dataset to enhance multi-objective alignment.  

3) Inference: Dynamically map user preferences to desired rewards in prompts using an analytical solution inspired by convex optimization. This achieves near Pareto-optimal outcomes.

Main Contributions:

- RiC offers simplicity, efficiency and flexibility for multi-objective alignment using only supervised finetuning of a single model.

- The analytical mapping method enables customizable alignment with diverse user preferences during inference.

- Empirical evaluation shows RiC outperforms MORLHF baselines on language generation tasks with only ~10% of their GPU training cost.

- RiC also demonstrates effective alignment on a text-to-image generation task.

The paper introduces a highly scalable and customisizable solution for multi-objective alignment of large foundation models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Rewards-in-Context (RiC), a highly scalable algorithm that aligns foundation models with multiple human preferences through supervised fine-tuning and inference-time adaptation, achieving superior empirical performance compared to multi-objective reinforcement learning baselines while requiring minimal computational resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Rewards-in-Context (RiC), a highly scalable algorithm for aligning large language models with multiple rewards using only supervised fine-tuning and a simple inference-time adaptation method. Specifically, RiC:

- Introduces a multi-reward conditional supervised fine-tuning method that aligns LLMs by incorporating multiple reward signals into the prompt context. This eliminates the need for reinforcement learning.

- Provides an analytical solution to map user preferences to desired rewards during inference, enabling dynamic adjustment to accommodate heterogeneous preferences. This is inspired by the solution to an abstracted convex optimization problem.  

- Achieves superior empirical performance in aligning with multiple rewards compared to multi-objective reinforcement learning baselines, while only requiring around 10% of their GPU training hours.

- Demonstrates strong performance in aligning LLMs as well as diffusion models with multiple objectives through supervised fine-tuning alone.

In summary, RiC's simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility in handling multiple rewards make it an appealing solution for multi-objective alignment of foundation models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does RiC reduce the computational cost of multi-objective alignment compared to prior approaches like MORLHF and Rewarded Soups? What are the key algorithmic differences that lead to lower computational requirements?

2. The preference-to-reward mapping in RiC is inspired by the analytical solution to an abstract convex optimization problem. Can you explain in more detail the formulation of this optimization problem and how its solution motivates the design of the mappings? 

3. What is the motivation behind using a multi-reward conditional supervised fine-tuning approach in the offline training stage of RiC? What are the benefits compared to using reinforcement learning as in MORLHF?

4. Explain the online training stage in RiC and discuss the rationale behind steps such as multi-objective rejection sampling. How does augmenting samples near the empirical Pareto front aid multi-objective alignment?

5. How does the inference stage adaptation method in RiC, based on the preference-to-reward mappings, differ from simply using linear mappings? Why is being able to dynamically adjust the mappings important?

6. What challenges may arise when applying RiC to objectives that have a strong positive correlation? How could the method be adapted to better handle such scenarios?

7. In what ways could the online training stage of RiC be expanded upon to further improve multi-objective alignment performance? What are some data augmentation techniques that could be beneficial? 

8. How suitable is RiC for low-data regimes compared to approaches based on reinforcement learning? What modifications may help improve sample efficiency?

9. What kinds of analyses could provide more theoretical justification for why the proposed preference-to-reward mappings are effective? Are there any analytic results that could be derived?

10. How could RiC be adapted for continual learning of new objectives over time? What algorithmic components would need to be updated to enable efficient incorporation of new rewards?
