# [Repoformer: Selective Retrieval for Repository-Level Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Repository-level code completion is challenging due to cross-file dependencies, requiring contextual information beyond the current file. 
- Recent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods retrieve and provide cross-file code/docs to code language models (LMs) as context.
- However, retrieval is inefficient and often unhelpful - 80%+ of retrieved contexts do not improve LM performance, sometimes even degrading it.

Proposed Solution: 
- A selective RAG framework where retrieval is avoided when deemed unnecessary or potentially harmful.
- Core is Repoformer - an intelligent LM fine-tuned via self-supervision for:
   1) Accurately self-evaluating if retrieval will improve its output quality.  
   2) Robustly leveraging potentially noisy retrieved contexts.
- Repoformer acts as both the selective retrieval policy and generator LM.
- A simple prompt-based inference procedure allows flexibility in trading off accuracy vs efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- Identify critical robustness and efficiency issues in invariable RAG for code completion.
- Propose selective RAG paradigm and design Repoformer LM to realize it. 
- Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate Repoformer outperforms state-of-the-art on diverse benchmarks while allowing up to 70% inference speedup.
- Show Repoformer generalizes across tasks, programming languages, model sizes and achieves strong accuracy-latency trade-offs.
- Establish Repoformer as an important advance towards more accurate and efficient RAG for code completion.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a selective retrieval framework for repository-level code completion where a fine-tuned code language model decides whether retrieving additional context can improve its output quality before generating code, achieving better accuracy and efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a selective retrieval augmentation framework for repository-level code completion. Specifically:

1) The paper identifies issues with invariably performing retrieval augmentation for code completion, including sparsity of benefits and efficiency problems. 

2) The paper proposes a selective retrieval mechanism where retrieval is avoided when deemed unnecessary or potentially harmful based on a learned policy.

3) The paper designs \textsc{Repoformer}, an intelligent code LM fine-tuned to accurately self-evaluate whether retrieval can improve its output quality and robustly leverage potentially noisy retrieved contexts. \textsc{Repoformer} acts as both the selective retrieval policy and the code completion model.

4) Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework with \textsc{Repoformer} achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art invariable retrieval methods while significantly improving efficiency. The framework effectively accommodates different code LMs, programming languages, and retrievers.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating an effective selective retrieval augmentation approach to address accuracy and efficiency issues with invariable retrieval for repository-level code completion.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Repository-level code completion - The task of completing lines, API invocations, or functions in a file from user repositories. A challenging task due to cross-file dependencies.  

- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) - Using retrieved information, like code snippets from other files, to augment a language model when generating code completions.

- Selective retrieval - Deciding whether retrieval augmentation is necessary for a given code completion instance, rather than retrieving invariably. Proposed to address issues of efficiency and robustness with standard RAG approaches.  

- Self-selective RAG - A model that can directly self-trigger cross-file retrieval by generating a special token, or abstain from retrieval, based on its assessment of whether retrieval will improve output quality.

- Repoformer - The proposed model that acts as both a selective retrieval policy and robust code generation LM, trained with a contrastive self-supervised approach on public repositories.  

- Accuracy vs efficiency tradeoffs - Evaluating code completion performance as well as inference speedup enabled by avoiding unnecessary retrievals.

- Robustness to noisy retrieved contexts - Assessing whether models can effectively leverage potentially noisy retrieved code to improve output quality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a selective retrieval framework for repository-level code completion. Can you explain in detail how the self-supervised learning approach enables the code LM to accurately self-evaluate whether retrieval can improve its output quality?

2. One of the principles outlined is "performance-oriented self-evaluation". What are the two key factors that the model combines to determine whether to abstain from retrieval augmentation?

3. How exactly does the contrastive data labeling scheme proposed mine self-supervision signals from public code repositories? Walk through the key steps. 

4. Explain the multi-task training objective designed for Repoformer. What are the two loss terms and what does each teach the model?

5. The paper argues that always performing retrieval introduces efficiency issues. Can you analyze the computational complexity and quantify the overhead introduced for a sample repository?

6. What are the advantages of formulating selective RAG as an extension to fill-in-the-middle instead of a standalone formulation?

7. The ablation study modifies several components of the overall approach. Can you summarize what was learned from each ablation experiment outlined?

8. One analysis evaluates the precision of retrieval abstention decisions. What causes the lower precision for function completion compared to line and API completion?

9. How does the approach demonstrate improved robustness to noisy retrieved contexts compared to baseline models? Quantify the differences.

10. The paper claims repoformer generalizes across programming languages and retrievers. What evidence is provided to support this claim?
