# [FreshLLMs: Refreshing Large Language Models with Search Engine   Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03214)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:How can large language models (LLMs) be augmented to improve their ability to provide factually correct and up-to-date responses, especially for questions that require fast-changing world knowledge?The key points are:1) The paper introduces a new QA benchmark called FreshQA to evaluate LLM factuality on diverse question types, including those needing up-to-date knowledge.2) Through extensive human evaluation, they show current LLMs struggle on questions requiring fast-changing knowledge and false premise detection.3) They propose a simple prompting method called FreshPrompt that substantially improves LLM accuracy by incorporating relevant, up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt via few-shot learning.4) Analysis shows factors like the number and order of incorporated search results impact the correctness of LLM-generated answers when using FreshPrompt.So in summary, the main research question is how to improve LLMs' factuality and handling of fast-changing knowledge, with FreshQA providing a way to probe this, and FreshPrompt offering a promising prompting-based solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Introduction of a new dynamic QA benchmark called FreshQA, consisting of 600 natural questions that test up-to-date real world knowledge. The questions are divided into categories based on how often the answers change, as well as false premise questions.- Extensive benchmarking and analysis of a diverse set of large language models on FreshQA, using a two-mode evaluation procedure to measure both correctness and hallucination. The results shed light on limitations of current LLMs, showing they struggle with fast-changing knowledge, false premises, and multi-hop reasoning. - Development of a simple yet effective method called FreshPrompt that substantially boosts LLM factuality on FreshQA by incorporating relevant, up-to-date information from a search engine into the model's prompt via few-shot learning. FreshPrompt outperforms competing search-augmented prompting methods.- Analysis of the factors that contribute to FreshPrompt's success, including the number/order of retrieved evidences and the writing style of the prompt demonstrations.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be the new benchmark, analysis of LLMs, and the proposed FreshPrompt method that leverages search engine results to improve factuality. The authors plan to release FreshQA and regularly update it to encourage further research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary: The paper introduces a new QA dataset called FreshQA to evaluate large language models on their ability to provide factual, up-to-date answers, reveals limitations of current models (especially on fast-changing and false premise questions), and proposes a simple prompting method called FreshPrompt that substantially improves accuracy by incorporating relevant information from a search engine.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I would compare it to other related research:- The paper introduces a new dynamic QA dataset called FreshQA that tests an AI model's ability to answer questions requiring up-to-date real-world knowledge. This adds to existing QA benchmarks by focusing on current events and facts that change over time. Other related datasets test temporal reasoning but do not update answers.- The paper shows that current LLMs struggle on FreshQA, especially for fast-changing knowledge and false premises. This is consistent with other work showing LLMs can hallucinate plausible but incorrect information. However, the analysis across different model types and question categories provides new insight.- The paper proposes a new method called FreshPrompt that substantially improves LLM performance by retrieving relevant information from search engines and incorporating it into the prompt with few-shot examples. Other recent work has explored search augmentation but FreshPrompt outperforms alternatives like Self-Ask. The analysis provides insights into effective prompting.- The two-mode relaxed/strict evaluation protocol is novel and lets the authors measure both correctness and hallucination. This provides a more nuanced view than just accuracy.- Releasing the dataset and committing to regular updates is a valuable contribution. Dynamic benchmarks require maintenance and the authors facilitate reproducibility and progress.In summary, the paper makes excellent contributions in terms of a new dynamic QA dataset, extensive evaluation illuminating LLM limitations, a highly effective search-prompting method, and analysis offering insights into best practices. The dataset and findings move forward the important goal of improving LLM factuality.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing automated LLM-based evaluators for the strict human evaluation of model responses, to reduce the expense of verifying all claims.- Exploring how FreshPrompt performs with other search engines besides Google Search, for cases where certain contextual information like answer boxes may not be available. - Applying question decomposition and issuing multiple search queries per question to further improve the results of FreshPrompt.- Evaluating the efficacy of FreshPrompt for more complex questions, such as those requiring multi-lingual/cross-lingual QA or long-form QA.- Comparing the performance of FreshPrompt's in-context learning approach to methods that fine-tune the base LLM on new knowledge.- Updating the FreshQA dataset regularly and expanding it to additional types of questions, as well as supporting contributions from the open source community.- Generalizing the insights from FreshPrompt to other dynamic QA datasets and search-augmented LLM applications.- Exploring other ways to mitigate hallucination, beyond using concise demonstrations.- Analyzing the extent to which larger LLM sizes could help improve performance on fast-changing and false premise questions.So in summary, some of the key directions are around automating evaluation, applying the approach to new domains/questions, comparing to other knowledge integration methods, expanding the dataset, reducing hallucination, and analyzing model scaling dynamics. The authors propose a promising approach and lay out an extensive set of opportunities for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces FreshQA, a new QA benchmark for evaluating the factuality of large language models (LLMs) in answering questions that require up-to-date real world knowledge. FreshQA contains 600 natural questions across 4 categories: never-changing, slow-changing, fast-changing, and false-premise. The authors benchmark a diverse set of LLMs on FreshQA and find through extensive human evaluation that all models struggle with fast-changing and false premise questions. This motivates the development of FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially improves LLM accuracy by incorporating relevant, up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt. Experiments show FreshPrompt outperforms competing search-augmented prompting methods. Analysis reveals the number and order of retrieved evidences significantly influences LLM answer correctness, and concise demonstrations help reduce hallucination. The paper makes available FreshQA and commits to regular updates to facilitate further research into improving LLM factuality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dynamic QA benchmark called FreshQA to evaluate the factuality of language model responses. FreshQA contains 600 natural questions divided into four categories - never-changing, slow-changing, fast-changing, and false-premise. The questions require up-to-date world knowledge to answer correctly, and some may be reclassified over time as the answers change. The authors benchmark a wide range of pre-trained language models on FreshQA using zero-shot prompting and find that all models struggle, especially on fast-changing and false-premise questions. This motivates developing FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that incorporates relevant search engine results into the prompt to provide up-to-date information. Experiments show FreshPrompt significantly boosts factuality over baselines, with the best GPT-4 variant improving 32.6% in relaxed accuracy over vanilla GPT-4. Analysis reveals the number and order of retrieved evidences impact correctness, and concise demonstrations help reduce hallucination. Overall, the work sheds light on LM limitations in adapting to changing knowledge and presents an effective prompting approach to ground them in up-to-date information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially improves the performance of a large language model (LLM) on the FreshQA question answering benchmark. FreshPrompt works by taking a question, using it to query a search engine (Google Search), and retrieving relevant and up-to-date information including organic search results, related questions, and crowdsourced Q&A snippets. It then formats this retrieved evidence into a prompt that is fed to the LLM, along with a few demonstrations that show examples of reasoning over search results to determine the most relevant, factual answer. Specifically, the retrieved evidence is formatted into a common structure and sorted with the most recent information at the end of the prompt, and 5 question-answer demonstrations are provided at the beginning. This allows the LLM to attend over the factual information retrieved from search in order to ground its responses in current knowledge, significantly boosting its performance on FreshQA compared to the vanilla LLM as measured by both relaxed and strict human evaluations.
