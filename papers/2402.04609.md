# [Improving Cross-Domain Low-Resource Text Generation through LLM   Post-Editing: A Programmer-Interpreter Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown promise in natural language tasks through zero-shot and few-shot learning. However, their performance suffers in low-resource sequence generation tasks like machine translation (MT) and logical form (LF) to text generation. 
- Fine-tuning smaller models on task-specific data and using them to post-edit LLM outputs can improve quality. But smaller models have limited domain generalization ability.
- Existing LLM post-editing methods are not optimized for text generation tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a neural programmer-interpreter approach that leverages both the domain generalization ability of LLMs and task-specific knowledge encoded by smaller fine-tuned models.
- The programmer is a smaller seq2seq model fine-tuned to generate word-level editing actions tailored for text generation.
- The interpreter is an LLM that refines its own output by processing instructions with predicted actions and editing examples, without any fine-tuning.
- Adversarially corrupt some actions in examples to make interpreter more robust.

Contributions:
- Novel method that combines strengths of LLMs and fine-tuned models for better cross-domain text generation.
- Specially designed edit actions and interpreter instructions optimized for text generation.
- Significantly outperforms prior LLM post-editing methods in low-resource MT and LF-to-text tasks when train/test domains differ.
- Matches or exceeds fine-tuned model performance in cross-domain scenarios.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative programmer-interpreter approach to effectively leverage both LLMs and fine-tuned models for low-resource text generation across domains. The tailored editing strategy optimized for text generation is a key advantage.
