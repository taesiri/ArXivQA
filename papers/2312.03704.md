## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars, a method to build high-fidelity relightable avatars of human heads that can be animated to generate novel expressions. The geometry representation is based on 3D Gaussians that are decoded on a shared UV space using a latent code to enable tracking facial motion and expressions. The appearance model incorporates diffuse shading via learned spherical harmonics radiance transfer and specular reflections via view-dependent spherical Gaussians aligned to a reflection vector, enabling efficient real-time relighting with spatially all-frequency reflections. An explicit eye model with modifications to support refraction and prevent poor local minima is also integrated. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art real-time renderable avatars, with high-fidelity relighting of skin, eyes, and hair strands. The avatars can also be driven live from headset cameras. The unified geometry and appearance representation significantly simplifies modeling while achieving extremely high visual quality.
