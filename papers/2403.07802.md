# [Boosting keyword spotting through on-device learnable user speech   characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Keyword spotting (KWS) systems deployed in real-world environments often suffer from accuracy drops when used by new users with unseen speech characteristics. Adapting KWS systems to particular user speech patterns is important but challenging due to limited on-device compute resources and scarcity of labeled in-domain speech samples.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel on-device learning architecture to adapt KWS systems to target users' speech. The architecture comprises a frozen KWS model backbone and a lightweight user embedding module that captures user-specific speech characteristics. The backbone extracts keyword features from speech while the embedding module maps user IDs to vector representations of their speech. The backbone features and user embeddings are multiplicatively fused and classified to spot keywords. Only the user embeddings are updated during on-device learning, avoiding expensive backbone fine-tuning.

The user-adaptive KWS pipeline is first jointly pretrained on a KWS dataset. When deployed to a new user, their speech is utilized to update only the user embeddings, thereby capturing their vocal characteristics. A few labeled samples per class are sufficient for adaptation. The user features mitigate accuracy drops on unseen speakers.

Main Contributions:
- Novel user-adaptive KWS architecture with frozen backbone & trainable user embeddings 
- Embeddings capture target user speech characteristics 
- Accuracy improvements of 6-19% on unseen speakers using updated user features
- Effective user adaptation with as few as 4 samples per class  
- Ultra low on-device learning cost - 23.7K parameters, <16KB memory, 13Î¼J per epoch
- Demonstrated feasibility for battery-powered TinyML applications

In summary, the paper presents a lightweight and sample-efficient on-device learning approach to boost KWS accuracy on new users by learning their speech characteristics. The proposed user embedding based adaptation incurrs minimal resource overheads, making it suitable for TinyML devices.
