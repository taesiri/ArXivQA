# [HiLo: Detailed and Robust 3D Clothed Human Reconstruction with High-and   Low-Frequency Information of Parametric Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04876)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from RGB images is challenging due to limited views and lack of depth information. Existing methods struggle to achieve detailed and robust reconstruction simultaneously. They tend to produce oversmoothed shapes or fail when the estimated parametric body model contains noise. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a high- and low-frequency (HiLo) reconstruction paradigm that enhances both geometry details and robustness. The key ideas are:

1) Use high-frequency (HF) information from the parametric body model's signed distance function (SDF) to improve detail. They design a progressive growing HF function that amplifies SDF variation to capture finer geometry. It's learned in a coarse-to-fine manner to alleviate convergence difficulty.

2) Use low-frequency (LF) information from the body model's low-resolution voxel grid to improve robustness to noise. They propose a spatial interaction implicit function that reasons about complementary spatial information across voxels via an attention mechanism.

Main Contributions:

1) A progressive HF signed distance function that enhances geometry details in a coarse-to-fine manner, alleviating issues with convergence.

2) A spatial interaction implicit function that leverages LF voxel information to improve robustness against inaccurate body model estimations.

3) State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative reconstruction results on Thuman2.0 and CAPE datasets. HiLo outperforms previous methods by 10.43% and 9.54% on the two datasets respectively. It also demonstrates improved robustness to various noise levels and faster convergence.

In summary, the proposed HiLo paradigm achieves detailed and robust clothed human reconstruction by effectively utilizing HF and LF information from the parametric body model. Both the progressive HF function and spatial interaction implicit function offer valuable contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called HiLo that achieves detailed and robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from a single RGB image by exploring high-frequency and low-frequency information from estimated parametric body models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. To enhance geometry details and improve robustness against noise during clothed human reconstruction, the authors propose to explore the high-frequency (HF) information and low-frequency (LF) information from a parametric body model simultaneously. 

2. To facilitate detailed reconstruction, they introduce a progressive high-frequency function to enhance the signed distance function (SDF) of the parametric model, providing regularization during reconstruction. This allows learning an HF SDF in a progressive manner to alleviate convergence difficulty.

3. To ensure robust reconstruction, they employ LF information from the voxelized naked body to regularize the reconstruction. They propose a spatial interaction implicit function that reasons complementary information between different voxels.

In summary, the key ideas are using HF information to reconstruct detail and using LF information to make the reconstruction robust against noise/inaccuracies. The progressive HF SDF and spatial interaction implicit function are proposed to achieve these goals.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- High-frequency (HF) information - Used to enhance geometry details of reconstructed humans. The paper explores using a progressive high-frequency signed distance function to improve detail.

- Low-frequency (LF) information - Used to improve robustness and mitigate noise. The paper leverages low-resolution voxel grids from the parametric body model as a form of LF information. 

- Signed distance function (SDF) - Represents geometry by distances to closest surface point. Used as a base representation and enhanced with HF information.

- Voxel grids - Discretized volumetric representation converted from the parametric body model mesh. Provides LF regularization. 

- Spatial interaction implicit function - Proposed module that allows voxels to interact and share information globally, aiding robustness. 

- Progressive learning - The high-frequency SDF is learned in a progressive, coarse-to-fine manner to alleviate issues with large gradients.

- Robustness - Goal of the method to achieve robust reconstruction, especially in the presence of noise or inaccuracies in the parametric body model.

- Details - Goal of the method to reconstruct detailed avatar geometry, like clothing wrinkles.

So in summary, key terms revolve around using HF and LF information from the parametric body model to achieve detailed yet robust reconstruction of dressed humans.
