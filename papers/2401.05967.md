# [Block-Diagonal Orthogonal Relation and Matrix Entity for Knowledge Graph   Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05967)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing rotation-based KGE models like RotatE and QuatE have two key issues:
  1) Lack of flexibility - Relation matrix size needs to increase proportionally with entity dimension, leading to redundancy.
  2) Difficulty generalizing to higher dimensions - Exploring rotations beyond 3D is challenging due to complexity and computations.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce OrthogonalE - a novel KGE model using:
  1) Matrices for entities - Allows flexibility in controlling entity dimensions. 
  2) Block-diagonal orthogonal matrices for relations - Replaces rotation matrices with more generalizable orthogonal transforms. Dimensions can be adapted to dataset complexity. 
  3) Riemannian optimization for relations - Enables effective optimization of orthogonal matrices.

Key Contributions:
- Enhances generality of KGE models - Can adjust block matrix dimensions to fit dataset complexity.
- Improves flexibility - Controls entity dimensions without unnecessary relation expansion. 
- Outperforms SOTA KGE models on benchmarks while using fewer relation parameters.
- Saves parameters by balancing entity matrices and block orthogonal relations.
- Demonstrates 4D and 5D rotations are feasible and effective for KGE.

In summary, the paper introduces OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model that is more generalized and flexible compared to prior rotation-based approaches. It achieves new SOTA results on KGE benchmarks while being parameter-efficient. The techniques open up avenues for further exploration of higher dimensional KGE models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a flexible and general knowledge graph embedding model called OrthogonalE that uses matrices to represent entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization to represent relations, outperforming state-of-the-art models while requiring fewer parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model called OrthogonalE that aims to be more flexible and general than existing rotation-based KGE models like RotatE and QuatE. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Using matrices to represent entities instead of vectors, which gives more flexibility to control the entity dimension without unnecessarily expanding the relation size. 

2) Employing block-diagonal orthogonal matrices to represent relations instead of rotation matrices. This allows exploring higher dimensional rotations more easily and makes the model more generalizable to datasets with different complexities.

3) Optimizing the relation matrices with Riemannian optimization on the orthogonal manifold instead of standard SGD. This is shown to optimize the orthogonal relation matrices more effectively. 

4) Experimental results showing that OrthogonalE outperforms state-of-the-art methods like RotatE and QuatE, while using significantly fewer parameters for relations. This demonstrates the flexibility, generality, and superiority of the proposed model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a more flexible and generalizable KGE model called OrthogonalE that leverages matrix representations, block-diagonal orthogonal matrices, and Riemannian optimization to outperform existing rotation-based approaches.

The paper proposes a new KGE model called OrthogonalE that employs block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations and matrices for entity representations. It aims to overcome limitations of prior rotation-based KGE models and provide more flexibility and generality. The key ideas focus on using orthogonal matrices rather than rotation matrices, representing relations as block-diagonal orthogonal matrices, optimizing them with Riemannian methods, and representing entities as matrices rather than vectors. Experiments demonstrate OrthogonalE's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.
