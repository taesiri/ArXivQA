# [Empowering Time Series Analysis with Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on leveraging large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The key problem is that training general-purpose time series models from scratch is challenging due to the large volumes and varieties of time series data across domains as well as the non-stationarity that leads to concept drift. Recent works have shown promise in exploiting pre-trained LLMs to facilitate various time series applications instead of training from scratch. Hence, this paper systematically categorizes existing methods and applications on LLM-based time series analysis.

The paper first introduces background on general LLMs in NLP and discusses the motivations and challenges of applying them for time series modeling. It then proposes a taxonomy to categorize existing methods into five groups: (1) Direct query: Querying LLMs directly to generate forecasts or predictions; (2) Tokenization: Converting time series into tokens/sequences that LLMs can process; (3) Prompt design: Crafting contextual prompts to provide additional guidance to LLMs; (4) Fine-tuning: Updating parts of the LLM parameters to adapt it to time series; (5) Model integration: Using the LLM as an enhancement component in a larger time series model.

The paper further discusses LLM applications on both general and spatial-temporal time series across various domains like finance, healthcare, traffic, and computer vision. It highlights sample methods and findings in each domain. 

The main contributions of this comprehensive survey are:
(1) Cataloging 21 representative LLM-based time series analysis papers. 
(2) Systematically categorizing methods based on the taxonomy and discussing associated tasks and domains.
(3) Summarizing opportunities and challenges to further advance research on exploiting LLMs for time series modeling and analysis.

Overall, this paper provides a unique perspective on existing literature at the intersection of LLMs and time series analysis. The proposed taxonomy and extensive discussions offer valuable insights and can encourage future works in this emerging field.
