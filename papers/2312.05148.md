## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a deep learning approach for automatic segmentation of the placenta in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI time series. Segmenting the placenta is important for assessing placental function and oxygenation dynamics, but is challenging due to fetal motion, maternal breathing, and rapid signal changes during the BOLD imaging protocol. The authors develop a 3D U-Net model with a novel boundary-weighted loss formulation to emphasize accurate delineation of the thin, elongated placenta. They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a dataset of 91 subjects across a range of pregnancy conditions, with mean Dice score of 82.8\% and low error in quantified BOLD signal changes. The model performs consistently in both normoxic and hyperoxic phases of the BOLD protocol. The authors illustrate the utility of this automatic segmentation for analyzing whole-organ BOLD signal increases during maternal hyperoxia. By enabling accurate placental segmentation throughout long BOLD MRI time series, this work could facilitate further research into placental function, fetal development, and identification of biomarkers related to pregnancy complications.
