# [Learning to Plan and Realize Separately for Open-Ended Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12506)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:Can decoupling the generation process into separate planning and realization phases lead to better performance for open-ended dialogue systems compared to an end-to-end approach? The key hypothesis appears to be that modeling the human language production process by separating planning and realization will produce better dialogue responses in terms of coherence, fluency, and appropriateness. The authors posit that typical end-to-end neural generation models for dialogue do not adequately capture the nuances of human language production. By introducing an explicit planning phase before realization, they aim to add more structure and controllability to the generation process.The main contributions seem to be:- Investigating the impact of separating planning and realization for open-domain dialogue through rigorous evaluation.- Proposing the use of LCS-inspired "ask" and "framing" representations to generate plans, instead of dialogue acts.- Releasing corpora annotated with different types of plans using both symbolic and neural planners.The central focus appears to be demonstrating that the proposed decoupled approach leads to quantifiable improvements in open-ended dialogue response quality over end-to-end baselines. The various human and automated evaluations seem designed to validate the main hypothesis.In summary, the key research direction is exploring modular planning-realization architectures to better model human language production for higher quality open-domain conversational agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Investigating the impact of separating planning and realization in open-domain dialogue systems. The paper hypothesizes that this separation will produce better responses compared to end-to-end architectures.2. Proposing the use of LCS-inspired representations based on "asks" and "framings" to generate plans. This is contrasted with using dialogue acts.3. Releasing corpora annotated with plans for all utterances, using three different planners - a symbolic planner and two neural attention-based planners. 4. Conducting evaluations, both automated and human, demonstrating that decoupling planning and realization performs better than an end-to-end approach on open-domain dialogue tasks.In summary, the key finding is that separating the dialogue generation process into explicit planning and realization phases outperforms end-to-end models that do not have this separation. The use of "ask" and "framing" representations for planning also seems to be an important contribution compared to using dialogue acts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in open-ended dialogue systems:- It focuses specifically on separating the planning and realization phases in generation, whereas most prior work has used end-to-end architectures. The decoupled approach is more consistent with traditional NLG pipelines and theories of human language production.- For planning, it leverages lexical conceptual structures rather than dialog acts. This provides a more detailed level of meaning representation to help constrain realization. Dialog acts are more abstract.- The planning phase includes both a symbolic planner and learned neural models. Using a symbolic planner to create training data for the neural models is a unique approach.- The realization component is based on fine-tuning a large pretrained language model (GPT-2), similar to some other recent work applying transfer learning for dialogue.- The evaluation includes both automated metrics and detailed human evaluations on appropriateness, quality, and usefulness. Many open-domain dialogue papers focus on automated metrics.- The corpora used (AntiScam and Persuasion for Social Good) contain strategic conversation tactics like asking and framing. This is a unique application area compared to everyday chitchat datasets.In summary, the key novelties are the decoupled architecture, use of lexical conceptual structures for planning, combination of symbolic and neural planners, and detailed human evaluations on strategic conversation datasets. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of planning and realization separation compared to end-to-end methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Exploring training the planning and realization phases together in an end-to-end hierarchical process. This could help further validate the efficacy of their approach of separating planning and realization.- Conducting more thorough and rigorous evaluations, including using additional metrics beyond the ones examined in the paper, and testing on more diverse corpora. This could provide stronger evidence to support their claims.- Generalizing to additional ask/framing types beyond the preliminary ontology explored in this work. The symbolic planner they use to generate "silver standard" training data could be adapted to cover more ask/framing types by adding lexicons.- Extending the approach to other corpora and domains beyond the AntiScam and Persuasion for Social Good datasets used in this work. Since their symbolic planner can produce training data, the approach could be scaled to other corpora given straightforward changes.- Improving the symbolic planner to handle more cases rather than defaulting to generic "RESPOND" plans when no ask/framing is detected. This could improve the quality of the "silver standard" training data.- Exploring the use of other large pre-trained language models beyond GPT-2.- Addressing issues found through qualitative analysis such as non-informative targets, incorrect plan constituents, ignored plans, and grammatical inconsistencies.In summary, the main future directions focused on further validation through more rigorous evaluation, scaling and generalizing the approach, and addressing limitations found through analysis of system outputs. The core idea of separating planning and realization appears promising based on the results shown, so extending this approach represents a key next step.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper investigates separating the natural language generation process in dialogue systems into two phases - planning and realization - instead of using an end-to-end system. The planning phase focuses on generating appropriate plans for response utterances using lexical conceptual structures rather than dialogue acts. Two neural planner models are trained - Context Attention and Pseudo Self Attention. The realization phase uses the generated plans from the planners to produce responses. Through automated metrics and human evaluations, the authors demonstrate that decoupling planning and realization performs better than an end-to-end approach on metrics of quality, appropriateness and usefulness. The main finding is that separating planning and realization outperforms an end-to-end system without explicit planning across multiple metrics in human evaluation studies. Overall, the paper provides evidence that modeling human language production by separating planning and realization can improve open-domain conversational systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes learning to plan and realize utterances separately for open-ended dialogue systems, in contrast to end-to-end approaches. In the planning phase, they extract plans based on asks and framings grounded in conversation analysis literature. They use a symbolic planner to extract plans automatically from utterances as training data. They then train two neural models, Context Attention and Pseudo Self Attention, to generate plans. In the realization phase, they input the plan along with the input utterance into a neural model to generate the response. Through automated and human evaluations, they find that decoupling planning and realization performs better than an end-to-end approach on metrics of quality and appropriateness. The Pseudo Self Attention model performs the best overall for planning based on human evaluation. Responses generated using the Context Attention planner are most preferred by humans over other models in the realization phase. They conclude that separating planning and realization is beneficial for open-ended dialogue systems. Areas of future work include adding more ask/framing types and joint training of the planning and realization components.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes decoupling the response generation process in open-ended dialogue systems into separate planning and realization phases. In the planning phase, the authors explore using a symbolic planner and two neural network models - Context Attention (CTX) and Pseudo Self Attention (PSA) - to generate response plans represented as structured meaning representations called asks and framings. The plans encode the intended action and motivation of the response. In the realization phase, the PSA model is used along with the generated response plans and input utterance to produce an appropriate response. Through automated metrics and detailed human evaluations, the authors demonstrate that separating generation into planning and realization performs better than an end-to-end approach without explicit planning. The key finding is that responses generated using the CTX and PSA generated plans are preferred by human evaluators over an end-to-end system across three metrics - appropriateness, quality and usefulness.
