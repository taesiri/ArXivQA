# [Toward Computationally Efficient Inverse Reinforcement Learning via   Reward Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09983)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer a reward function that recovers an expert's behavior in an environment. However, IRL algorithms are typically computationally expensive as they require solving multiple reinforcement learning (RL) problems within the IRL optimization loop.
- Each RL sub-problem may be challenging to solve, requiring significant planning depth. Therefore, IRL remains computationally prohibitive for many real-world problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using potential-based reward shaping to reduce the computational complexity of each RL sub-problem within the IRL loop, without changing the optimal policies.
- Specifically, the paper introduces "planning-aware reward shaping", which uses both optimal expert trajectories and random exploration trajectories to choose a shaping potential function. This potential is used to shape the initial learned reward to obtain a shaped reward that minimizes an upper bound on the planning depth.
- Planning depth is measured by an algorithm-agnostic effective horizon, which has been shown to correlate with sample complexity of RL algorithms like DQN and PPO. By minimizing this effective horizon through reward shaping, the hope is to reduce sample complexity and computational burden of each RL sub-problem.

Main Contributions:
- Motivates using reward shaping to reduce computational complexity of IRL.
- Introduces planning-aware reward shaping approach that leverages both optimal and random exploration trajectories to choose shaping potential.
- Demonstrates proof-of-concept where oracle shaping procedure reduces effective horizon bound and speeds up DQN convergence compared to unshaped reward, suggesting reduction in planning depth.
- Serves as inspiration for future work to develop IRL algorithms that are more computationally efficient through automatic reward shaping procedures.

In summary, this paper makes a novel connection between reward shaping and computational complexity of IRL, and provides initial support for using planning-aware shaping to reduce planning depth in each RL sub-problem. The hope is this proof-of-concept will motivate further research into efficient IRL via adaptive reward shaping.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper motivates the use of potential-based reward shaping to reduce the computational burden of solving the reinforcement learning sub-problems within inverse reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of potential-based reward shaping to reduce the computational complexity of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Specifically, the paper:

- Motivates using reward shaping to reduce the planning depth, and thus sample complexity, of the reinforcement learning sub-problems that need to be solved in IRL. This could make IRL more computationally efficient.

- Introduces the idea of "planning-aware reward shaping", which involves choosing a shaped reward that minimizes a bound on planning depth. The shaped reward is constructed by adding a shaping potential to an initial feasible IRL reward.

- Derives a formula for choosing an optimal shaping potential based on the optimal value function and the Q-function under a random policy. This potential is shown to minimize the proposed bound on planning depth.

- Demonstrates in simple gridworld experiments that shaping the reward using an oracle version of the proposed approach speeds up convergence of DQN, supporting the idea it reduces planning depth.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and providing a proof-of-concept for using planning-aware reward shaping to make IRL more computationally tractable. The paper hopes this idea will inspire more research into efficient IRL algorithms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper motivates the use of potential-based reward shaping to reduce the computational burden of each RL sub-problem in IRL. However, the details of how this would be achieved in practice are not provided. What specific algorithmic changes would need to be made to existing IRL methods to leverage reward shaping for computational efficiency?

2. Equation 2 provides a formula for choosing a shaping potential $\Phi$ based on estimates of the optimal value function $V_0^*$ and the random policy $Q$-function $Q_0^{\text{rand}}$. However, accurately estimating $V_0^*$ essentially solves the forward RL problem. How can we tractably estimate good proxy shaping potentials without full knowledge of $V_0^*$? 

3. The experiments use DQN performance with different shaped rewards as a proxy for planning depth. However, DQN may not be the most appropriate algorithm for assessing computational complexity. What other RL algorithms should be tested to better validate the impact on planning depth? Are there more direct ways to quantify changes in planning depth?

4. The gridworld experiment evaluates the method in a simple tabular setting. How well would the approach transfer to more complex, high-dimensional environments where function approximation would be necessary? Would errors in the learned potential shape detrimentally impact policy optimization?

5. The paper focuses exclusively on using optimal expert trajectories for IRL. How could the method leverage suboptimal demonstrations or preference comparisons to choose an efficient shaped reward? Would the bound used for the potential optimization still be valid?

6. The potential shaping procedure is performed once based on trajectories sampled under the initial reward $R_0$. Could there be benefit to iteratively updating the shaping as the reward estimate changes during IRL? What difficulties might this introduce?

7. The shaped reward encodes the same optimal policies as the original IRL reward. Could the technique be extended to allow changes to the policies while still reducing planning depth? What would the tradeoffs be?

8. The method requires sampling random trajectories in addition to expert demonstrations. In practice, how could these random explorations be efficiently generated? Could off-policy data be reused instead of dedicated random rollouts?

9. The paper claims the shaping potential is chosen to minimize a bound on an algorithm-agnostic measure of planning depth. However, details of this derivation are relegated to the appendix. Provide an intuitive explanation for why Equation 2 minimizes this planning depth bound.  

10. The paper states that estimating $Q_0^{\text{rand}}$ is easier than estimating $V_0^*$. Empirically validate this claim by examining sample complexity and stability of different potential estimators on a suite of benchmark tasks.
