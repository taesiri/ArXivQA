# [EyeTrans: Merging Human and Machine Attention for Neural Code   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Code summaries help developers comprehend code, but manually writing them is tedious. Neural code summarization uses deep learning to automatically generate summaries, but these models don't consider human attention patterns when reading code. 

- This paper hypothesizes that incorporating human attention data, collected via eye-tracking studies, can enhance neural code summarization models based on the Transformer architecture.

Method:
- The authors conduct an eye-tracking study with 27 programmers summarizing Java methods to collect human attention data. They identify common attention switches between code elements.

- They propose EyeTrans, which incorporates this human attention data into Transformer models by representing attention switches as connections between code tokens in the input embeddings. This helps the model's self-attention mechanism discern related tokens.

- EyeTrans is evaluated on two code summarization tasks: classifying method names (functional summarization) and generating method summary comments (general summarization).

Results:
- Integrating human attention improves performance by up to 29.91% on functional summarization and 6.39% on general summarization over baseline Transformers.

- Analysis shows EyeTrans enhances model robustness to noise and improves efficiency. Visualizations also demonstrate EyeTrans refines Transformer self-attention patterns.

Contributions:
- First approach integrating human attention from eye-tracking with Transformer models for neural code summarization.
- Novel method to incorporate attention data into model without altering architecture.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate clear performance gains on two summarization tasks.
- Analysis provides insights into model behavior changes when combining human and machine attention.

The summary covers the key points about the problem, proposed method, results, and contributions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
