# [LargeKernel3D: Scaling up Kernels in 3D Sparse CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10555)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to effectively design and apply large convolutional kernels in 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 3D vision tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Large convolutional kernels are important for 3D CNNs to capture long-range dependencies and enlarge receptive fields, similar to findings in 2D CNN research.

2) But directly applying large kernels to 3D CNNs faces challenges in efficiency and optimization. 

3) The proposed spatial-wise partition convolution and large-kernel module can enable the use of large kernels in 3D CNNs while avoiding the efficiency and optimization issues.

So in summary, the paper aims to show that with proper designs, large kernels can be effectively incorporated into 3D CNNs to improve performance on 3D vision tasks, overcoming challenges faced by naive use of large 3D kernels. The experiments validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new spatial-wise large-kernel convolution (SW-LK Conv) and building 3D convolutional networks LargeKernel3D with large kernels based on it. The key ideas are:

- Proposing spatial-wise partition convolution to share weights in the spatial dimensions of large kernels instead of channel dimensions. This allows using large kernels efficiently in 3D CNNs. 

- Introducing position embeddings to maintain the detail capturing ability of large kernels. 

- Building LargeKernel3D networks by simply replacing plain 3D convolutions with SW-LK Convs in existing backbones.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on 3D semantic segmentation on ScanNet and 3D object detection on nuScenes, showing the effectiveness of large kernels in 3D CNNs.

In summary, the main contribution is designing an efficient large-kernel convolution for 3D and building high-performance 3D CNNs with it, outperforming previous methods. The key novelty is the spatial-wise weight sharing design that makes 3D large kernels feasible.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a spatial-wise partition convolution to enable efficient large kernel designs for 3D convolutional networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D semantic segmentation and object detection benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D sparse convolutional neural networks:

- This paper focuses on designing efficient and effective large kernels for 3D sparse CNNs. Most prior work on 3D CNNs uses small 3x3x3 kernels due to the high computational cost of 3D convolutions. This paper shows that large kernels can be beneficial for 3D tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection.

- The key contribution is proposing a spatial-wise partition convolution to enable large kernels while maintaining efficiency. This is a novel 3D-specific design. Previous methods like depthwise convolutions used in 2D CNNs are not very effective in the 3D sparse setting. 

- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on major 3D benchmarks like ScanNet, nuScenes, and Waymo. The proposed LargeKernel3D model outperforms previous 3D CNN and transformer models, showing the benefits of the large kernel design.

- Compared to transformer-based 3D models like Point Transformer and Fast Point Transformer, this work shows competitive or better performance with lower latency by leveraging sparse 3D convolutions.

- The scalability of the method to very large 17x17x17 kernels on Waymo data is notable. This shows the potential of the approach to capture greater context with large datasets.

Overall, the key novelty is in designing and demonstrating effective large kernels tailored for 3D sparse data. The paper makes both algorithmic and empirical contributions over prior art in 3D deep learning. The results validate the importance of receptive field size and long-range modeling in 3D perception tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring larger kernel sizes beyond 17x17x17 on the Waymo dataset. The results in Table 5 show performance gains as the kernel size is increased, so the authors suggest trying even larger kernels given sufficient data and compute. 

- Applying the proposed spatial-wise partition convolution to other 3D tasks and datasets. The current work focuses on semantic segmentation and object detection, but the approach may also be beneficial for other tasks like 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.

- Combining the proposed method with more advanced fusion techniques for multi-modal 3D detection. The simple voxel-wise fusion in the paper can likely be improved using more sophisticated fusion methods.

- Searching for optimal kernel sizes on different datasets instead of hand-designing them. The authors suggest techniques like neural architecture search could help find ideal kernel configurations for varying datasets.

- Addressing limitations of the method on runtime and memory by exploring efficient implementations and approximations of large 3D kernels.

- Extending the approach to process other 3D representations beyond voxels, such as graphs or meshes.

- Studying the effects of large 3D kernels in other domains like medical imaging or robotics.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring larger kernels, applying the method to new tasks and datasets, improving multimodal fusion, automating kernel design, addressing computational limitations, and extending beyond voxels to other 3D representations across different application domains. The spatial-wise partition convolution shows promise for advancing 3D deep learning.
