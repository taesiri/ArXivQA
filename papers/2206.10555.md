# [LargeKernel3D: Scaling up Kernels in 3D Sparse CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10555)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to effectively design and apply large convolutional kernels in 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 3D vision tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Large convolutional kernels are important for 3D CNNs to capture long-range dependencies and enlarge receptive fields, similar to findings in 2D CNN research.

2) But directly applying large kernels to 3D CNNs faces challenges in efficiency and optimization. 

3) The proposed spatial-wise partition convolution and large-kernel module can enable the use of large kernels in 3D CNNs while avoiding the efficiency and optimization issues.

So in summary, the paper aims to show that with proper designs, large kernels can be effectively incorporated into 3D CNNs to improve performance on 3D vision tasks, overcoming challenges faced by naive use of large 3D kernels. The experiments validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new spatial-wise large-kernel convolution (SW-LK Conv) and building 3D convolutional networks LargeKernel3D with large kernels based on it. The key ideas are:

- Proposing spatial-wise partition convolution to share weights in the spatial dimensions of large kernels instead of channel dimensions. This allows using large kernels efficiently in 3D CNNs. 

- Introducing position embeddings to maintain the detail capturing ability of large kernels. 

- Building LargeKernel3D networks by simply replacing plain 3D convolutions with SW-LK Convs in existing backbones.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on 3D semantic segmentation on ScanNet and 3D object detection on nuScenes, showing the effectiveness of large kernels in 3D CNNs.

In summary, the main contribution is designing an efficient large-kernel convolution for 3D and building high-performance 3D CNNs with it, outperforming previous methods. The key novelty is the spatial-wise weight sharing design that makes 3D large kernels feasible.
