# [AI for non-programmers: Applied AI in the lectures for students without   programming skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05547)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI is becoming increasingly important across disciplines, but many students lack programming skills needed to understand it. There is a need for effective educational strategies to teach applied AI concepts to non-programmers.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a generalized didactic planning script to integrate applied AI into discipline-specific lectures and courses for students without programming skills. 

- The planning script is structured around the AI application pipeline (idea, data, data preparation, model selection, model training, deployment, evaluation). Steps requiring programming are simplified using executable web pages.

- The script spans 3-4 teaching units and combines AI concepts with study-relevant topics to awaken deeper understanding and interest in AI.


Key Contributions:

- Presents a step-by-step didactic approach to make applied AI education accessible to non-programmers based on the AI application pipeline.

- Bridges the gap between abstract AI concepts and real-world applications through contextual, hands-on learning activities tailored to specific study programs.  

- Provides an example implementation for a lecture series in an Energy Management Master's program, demonstrating integration of AI tasks like image classification and time series forecasting.

- Introduces a checklist to assess if and how AI could be incorporated into other disciplinary courses and curricula, even for students without programming skills.

- Discusses next steps like use of physical AI models to further demystify and spur interest in AI as an increasingly crucial future skill.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in presenting a structured pedagogical blueprint to make interdisciplinary applied AI education more achievable and engaging for non-programmers.
