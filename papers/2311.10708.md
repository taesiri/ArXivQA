# [SelfEval: Leveraging the discriminative nature of generative models for   evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10708)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a method called SelfEval to evaluate the text-to-image capabilities of generative diffusion models by estimating image likelihoods given text prompts and using them for discriminative image-text classification tasks.
