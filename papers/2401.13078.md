# [Open-Source, Cost-Aware Kinematically Feasible Planning for Mobile and   Surface Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of performant and openly available kinematically feasible motion planners suitable for mobile and surface robots in research. Most robots rely on infeasible planners like A* or Dijkstra's which don't provide drivability guarantees. 
- New robot applications like last-mile delivery, automated lifts, and construction monitoring require at minimum kinematically feasible paths, but there are no quality implementations integrated into major robotics frameworks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the "Smac Planner", an open-source C++ search-based planning framework to easily create performant planners. 
- Within this framework, the authors propose 3 planners: 2D-A*, Hybrid A*, and State Lattice planners. 
- These "Cost-Aware" variants have modifications like new heuristics and traversal functions tailored for mobile robots.

Key Contributions:
- Smac Planner framework that enables adding new planners in ~200 lines of code
- Introduction of "Cost-Aware" variants of Hybrid A* and State Lattice planners with mobile-specific heuristics, penalties, resolution settings.
- Provides first integrated, high-quality feasible planners in ROS 2 Navigation system (Nav2), enabling new robot platforms.
- Benchmarking shows Smac planners are 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than baselines, with slightly suboptimal paths for feasibility.
- Framework and planners open-sourced and already adopted by many organizations for research and industry use.

In summary, the paper fills the gap of missing performant and kinematically feasible planners for mobile robots by proposing the open-source Smac framework and tailored "Cost-Aware" variants of Hybrid A* and State Lattice planners. It benchmarks performance and highlights adoption into ROS 2 Nav2, enabling new robots in research and industry.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces an open-source planning framework called Smac Planner with efficient implementations of feasible planners like Hybrid A* and State Lattice tailored to the needs of mobile robots, with benchmarking showing superior performance over alternatives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of the Smac Planner, an open-source search-based planning framework that makes it easy to create new planners by implementing templates.

2. The characterization of several variations of existing kinematically feasible planners (Hybrid A* and State Lattice) to adapt them to the needs and conventions of mobile robotics. These are dubbed "Cost-Aware" planners.

3. Providing performance benchmarking of the Cost-Aware planners against other standard planning frameworks.

In summary, the paper fills a gap by providing high-quality, open-source implementations of kinematically feasible planners suitable for mobile robots and robotics research, with customizations specifically for this domain. It also analyzes their performance compared to existing options. The Smac Planner framework and Cost-Aware planner variations represent the key contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Smac Planner - The name of the planning framework introduced in the paper. It is designed to make creating search-based planners simple.

- Cost-Aware - Refers to variations of existing planners (e.g. Hybrid A*, State Lattice) introduced in the paper that utilize cost map information to guide and constrain the search.

- Mobile Robots - The paper is motivated by providing performant, feasible planners suitable for mobile robots, especially non-holonomic and non-circular robots.

- Kinematically Feasible - The planners provide guaranteed feasibility respecting kinodynamic or kinematic constraints of various robot drive trains.

- Search-based Planning - The Smac framework and planners are search-based methods like A* rather than sampling based.

- Hybrid A* - One of the feasible planners implemented in the Smac framework. Uses a search guided by cost maps and robot kinematic constraints.

- State Lattice - Another feasible planner using a graph of pre-generated motion primitives respecting kinodynamic constraints.

- Navigation System - The Smac planners are integrated into the navigation system framework Nav2 in ROS 2.

- Benchmarking - Performance analysis and benchmarks of the planners vs alternatives are provided.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the motivation behind developing the Smac Planner framework? Why does it aim to fill a gap compared to existing planning frameworks like OMPL and SBPL?

2. Explain the high-level design of the Smac Planner framework. How does it allow new planners to be added easily? What is the role of the node planner templates?

3. What is the Cost-Aware Obstacle Heuristic and how does it guide the search process? How is it different from traditional obstacle distance heuristics? 

4. Explain the different traversal penalty functions defined in the paper and their effect on the resulting paths. How do they remove the need for post-processing path smoothing?

5. How does the paper argue that mobile robots have different planning requirements compared to autonomous vehicles? What alterations are made to the hybrid A* and state lattice planners to adapt them?

6. Describe the process of generating the minimum control set for the state lattice planner. Why is a non-uniform discretization of headings used?

7. Explain the proposed method for generating feasible trajectories with minimum curvature for the state lattice planner. How is the vehicle's minimum turning radius ensured?

8. Analyze and compare the performance of the different Smac planners in the random occupancy benchmark experiments. What conclusions can be drawn about their strengths?  

9. Critically analyze the paths shown in Figure 8 of the warehouse environment. What relative advantages do the feasible planners demonstrate over the 2D A* planner?

10. Discuss the significance of the Smac Planner becoming the standard global planner in ROS Navigation 2. What impact could this have on real-world mobile robot applications?
