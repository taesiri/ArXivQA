# [Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty   Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces challenges in exploration, especially in sparse reward environments. Agents need to explore efficiently in a coordinated way. 
- However, in decentralized settings, agents only have access to local observations instead of global states. The novelty of local observations can be very different from the novelty of global states, making independent exploration inefficient.
- Previous multi-agent exploration methods rely on extra communication of observations/actions or centralized training, which limits scalability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MACE, a simple yet effective method to enable coordinated exploration under decentralized learning settings.

- MACE uses limited communication where agents only share scalar local novelty values. By summing local novelties, agents approximate global novelty for more reliable intrinsic rewards.  

- MACE also encourages agents to influence others' exploration by quantifying the mutual information between one agent's action and future accumulated novelty of others. This mutual information is transformed into hindsight intrinsic rewards.

- The weighted combination of the two intrinsic rewards drives agents to explore novel states in a coordinated way.

Main Contributions:
- Approximates global novelty for decentralized agents using summed local novelties communicated between agents

- Newly introduces weighted mutual information to measure influence on other agents' exploration

- Converts the weighted mutual information into hindsight intrinsic rewards that enable coordinated exploration  

- Achieves superior performance over baselines in multi-agent tasks with sparse rewards, using limited communication

In summary, MACE enables efficient coordinated exploration for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning through novelty sharing and hindsight influence quantification, with simple limited communication.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MACE, a multi-agent coordinated exploration method that uses novelty sharing and weighted mutual information converted to intrinsic rewards to enable decentralized agents to effectively explore sparse-reward cooperative environments in a coordinated way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MACE, a multi-agent coordinated exploration method for decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. MACE introduces two types of intrinsic rewards:

1) A novelty-based intrinsic reward that uses the summation of all agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty, in order to provide a more reliable novelty estimate to guide exploration. 

2) A hindsight-based intrinsic reward that quantifies and encourages the influence of an agent's action on other agents' accumulated future novelty, in order to boost coordinated exploration. This is calculated using a new metric called weighted mutual information.

Through empirical evaluation in three multi-agent environments, the paper shows that MACE enables agents to explore effectively in a coordinated decentralized way and solve tasks with sparse rewards, which existing decentralized learning methods fail to solve. The ablation studies also validate that both parts of the proposed intrinsic rewards are indispensable for the method's superior performance.

In summary, the main contribution is designing a practical and effective intrinsic reward approach to enable coordinated exploration for decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) Why does the paper propose using weighted mutual information rather than normal mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' exploration? What are the limitations of using normal mutual information?

2) The hindsight-based intrinsic reward proposed in the paper requires estimating the posterior distribution $p(a_t^i|o_t^i,z_t^j)$. What are the challenges in estimating this distribution and how does the paper address them? 

3) The paper mentions using both on-policy and off-policy samples to estimate the posterior distribution $p(a_t^i|o_t^i,z_t^j)$. What is the trade-off between using purely on-policy versus off-policy samples? Why does the paper choose to use a mix of both?

4) How does the scalable hindsight-based intrinsic reward proposed in the Appendix address the potential lack of scalability when the number of agents increases? What simplifying assumption does it make and what are its limitations?

5) Could the summation of local novelties used to approximate the global novelty potentially overestimate novelty in some cases? When might this approximation break down?

6) Does the performance improvement from MACE come more from the novelty-based intrinsic reward or the hindsight-based intrinsic reward? How could this be analyzed further? 

7) Could the method be extended to competitive or mixed cooperative-competitive (as in Stag Hunt) environments? What challenges would need to be addressed?

8) How sensitive is the performance of MACE to the hyperparameter Î»? Could it be adaptively set instead of pre-defined?

9) How does the sample efficiency of MACE compare to more complex CTDE exploration methods? Where does the performance gain and loss come from?

10) How could hierarchical reinforcement learning be combined with MACE to extend it to environments with many more agents? What modules would need to change or be added?
