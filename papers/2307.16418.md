# [DRAW: Defending Camera-shooted RAW against Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16418)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to protect camera-shot RAW images against image manipulation in a way that is robust, imperceptible, and lightweight enough to be integrated into real cameras. The key hypothesis is that by introducing an imperceptible protective signal into the RAW image data, the authors can enable accurate detection and localization of manipulated areas in the rendered RGB images, even after various image processing operations like compression or blurring. The protective signal essentially serves as invisible "locks" on the image pixels that can reveal tampering.The main contributions revolve around:1) Proposing a novel framework called DRAW that protects RAW images by injecting a protective signal that transfers to rendered RGB images.2) Demonstrating that this RAW protection enables more robust manipulation detection compared to prior passive forensic methods or direct RGB protection.3) Designing a lightweight Multi-frequency Partial Fusion Network (MPF-Net) to embed the protective signal while maintaining visual quality.4) Showing that the lightweight architecture could enable integrating image protection into cameras to restrict manipulation.In summary, the core hypothesis is that proactive RAW protection can enable imperceptible yet robust image forgery detection and localization, which could be practical to deploy on real cameras. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability and provide a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing DRAW, the first method to defend against image manipulation by injecting imperceptible protective signals into RAW image data. This allows the protective signal to be transferred to rendered RGB images regardless of the ISP pipeline used.2. Demonstrating that with DRAW's RAW protection, image manipulation localization networks are more robust to common lossy image operations like JPEG compression, blurring, and rescaling. 3. Introducing a novel lightweight network called MPF-Net for integrating RAW protection into cameras. MPF-Net uses frequency learning and partial feature fusion to achieve good performance with only 0.95% of the parameters and 20.9% of the memory cost of U-Net.4. Extensive experiments on RAW datasets like RAISE, FiveK, and SIDD showing the effectiveness of DRAW for imperceptible RAW protection and improving robustness of manipulation detection. Performance gains are demonstrated by applying DRAW to state-of-the-art detectors like MVSS and RIML.5. Potentially changing the current situation where digital images can be freely manipulated by enabling RAW protection in cameras during image capture. The lightweight MPF-Net makes this feasible.In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in defending against image manipulation via a new RAW protection paradigm and lightweight network design that could be integrated into cameras to restrict manipulation at the source. The effectiveness is substantiated through comprehensive experiments.
