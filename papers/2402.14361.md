# [OpenTab: Advancing Large Language Models as Open-domain Table Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14361)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT have limited knowledge scope and struggle with tasks requiring reasoning over structured data like tables. 
- Existing retrieval augmented LLMs are designed for text and do not work well for table retrieval and reasoning. Tables have diverse data types, large sizes, and complex relationships that pose challenges.
- Open-domain table reasoning is hard as the relevant table must be retrieved from a large corpus before reasoning over it to answer a question or verify a fact. There is a precision-recall tradeoff with retrieving more tables.

Proposed Solution - OpenTab:
- An end-to-end open-domain table reasoning framework powered by LLMs without fine-tuning on the target dataset.
- Uses a BM25 retriever to efficiently retrieve relevant tables from a large corpus.
- A Coder LLM generates SQL queries of increasing complexity (basic to advanced) to query the table database and handle scalability.
- A Selector extracts most relevant rows from large tables as context for the LLM. 
- A Reader LLM reasons over SQL execution results and table context to output the final response.
- A reranking strategy called Generative Reranking & Sequential Reasoning is proposed to pick the most relevant table and SQL by comparing query similarity.

Main Contributions:
- Significantly outperforms baselines on question answering and fact verification under both open-domain and closed-domain settings, without any fine-tuning.
- Achieves high accuracy, scalability to large tables, robustness against generation errors using the SQL abstraction and prompting strategies. 
- Provides detailed analysis on the efficacy of the table retriever, and ablations of the different components.

The paper demonstrates how to effectively adapt LLMs for accurate and robust open-domain table reasoning, while maintaining high scalability. The modular design and lack of a specialized fine-tuning requirement increases the flexibility of deployment.
