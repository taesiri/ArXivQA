# [Distilled Self-Critique of LLMs with Synthetic Data: a Bayesian   Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01957)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called distilled Self-Critique (dSC) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. dSC builds on prior work framing reinforcement learning from human feedback as Bayesian inference. The key idea is to refine LLM outputs through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler that alternates between critique and revision steps, using only synthetic data. The samples are then used to fine-tune the LLM to distill the refined responses. Experiments on improving safety, sentiment, and privacy control demonstrate that dSC can effectively steer LLMs at low cost. The method incorporates an explicit likelihood model based on an external reward (unlike Self-Refine), includes explicit critique and revision steps (unlike ReST), and has a distillation phase (unlike both). dSC provides a novel perspective of criticizing and revising an LLM's own generations as Bayesian inference, opening avenues for further improvements.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities, but there are still concerns around their safe and ethical use. 
- Prior work has focused on aligning LLMs to human values through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or model feedback (RLAIF).

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a new method called "distilled Self-Critique" (dSC) to align LLMs by refining their outputs. 
- dSC interprets RLAIF as a Bayesian inference process using a Gibbs sampler with synthetic data.
- It has explicit critique and revision steps where the LLM critiques its own output and provides a revised output.
- The refined outputs are then distilled back into the LLM through self-training.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a Bayesian perspective to interpret RLAIF methods.
- Introduces the dSC framework requiring only synthetic data to align LLMs through MCMC sampling and self-distillation.
- Evaluates dSC on experiments related to safety, sentiment modification and privacy control.
- Shows improved performance over baselines in avoiding harmful content, removing negative sentiment, and reducing personally identifiable information.
- Demonstrates the approach can work with both synthetic data from the model itself as well as transfer learning from another model's synthetic data.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel distilled Self-Critique approach to align LLMs that provides both a useful framework and strong empirical results across multiple alignment tasks. The method is self-contained only requiring synthetic data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes distilled Self-Critique (dSC), a method to align language models with human values by refining their outputs through a Gibbs sampler that is later distilled into a fine-tuned model, using only synthetic data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called "distilled Self-Critique" (dSC) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Specifically:

- dSC provides a novel interpretation of reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) as Bayesian inference. It incorporates a reward model as a likelihood to bias samples from a LLM towards desirable attributes. 

- dSC refines LLM outputs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler with alternating steps of critiques and revisions, using only synthetic data.

- A distillation phase then amortizes the sampler by fine-tuning the original LLM on the accepted samples, avoiding expensive sampling at inference time.

- dSC is demonstrated to improve LLM safety, sentiment and privacy control in experiments, showing it can serve as a cheap and viable technique to align LLMs.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing distilled Self-Critique as a new RLAIF method for aligning LLMs that introduces a Bayesian perspective and self-distillation based on synthetic data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Distilled Self-Critique (dSC) - The main method proposed in the paper for aligning language models using synthetic data and self-distillation.

- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) - An existing approach for aligning models that the paper builds upon in its Bayesian interpretation. 

- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) - Used in the critique and revision steps of dSC to sample from a posterior distribution.

- Gibbs sampler - A type of MCMC approach used in the dSC framework.

- Likelihood model - Used to debias the MCMC samples in dSC. Interpreted as a reward model.

- Self-distillation - The process in dSC of distilling the samples from the MCMC process back into the original language model.  

- Alignment - The overall goal of steering language model generations towards desirable attributes like safety.

- Synthetic data - dSC requires only synthetic/automatically generated data rather than human labels.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed dSC method, its inspiration from Bayesian RLHF, the technical details of how it works, and the end goal of aligning LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the distilled Self-Critique method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes interpreting RLAIF as a form of Bayesian inference. How exactly does the Gibbs sampling procedure link to Bayesian inference? What are the prior and posterior distributions here?

2. The critique and revision steps define a Gibbs sampler that generates text conditioned on high reward. What are some ways the proposal distribution in the sampler can be improved beyond the original LLM's distribution? 

3. The acceptance step uses a Metropolis criterion based on the reward model. What are some alternatives acceptance criteria that could work? How do they compare to the proposed method?

4. What types of divergences could be used in the distillation step besides reverse KL? What are the tradeoffs of each? Could we incorporate both accepted and rejected samples?

5. The synthetic training data is generated with simpler, non-distilled models. What are some ways to create better training data? Could we use the distilled model to generate better samples? 

6. How exactly does the distillation step amortize the computational expense of running the MCMC chain at inference time? What is the connection to amortized inference here?

7. What are some ways the refinement prompts themselves (critique and revision) could be improved to produce better generations?

8. The proposed approach requires a separate reward model. What are some ways we could avoid needing an explicit reward model in the loop?

9. What types of alignment objectives beyond safety and privacy could this method apply to? What aspects of the approach would need to change?

10. The method relies on synthetic data. What are some ways we could reduce the need for synthetic data while retaining the critique, revision, and distillation components?
