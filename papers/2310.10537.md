## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper evaluates new Microscaling (MX) data formats that combine block-level scaling with narrow floating-point and integer datatypes. Previous work has explored micro-scaled formats like HBFP, but MX is the first open standard aimed at production training and inference.

- The paper demonstrates MX formats as a drop-in replacement for FP32 across a broad range of models and tasks. This shows the general applicability of MX formats with low user friction. Prior work has tended to focus evaluation on a narrower set of applications. 

- For the first time, the paper shows training of large transformer models using sub-8-bit weights, activations, and gradients with no loss in accuracy compared to FP32. This pushes the envelope compared to prior work that has only shown sub-8-bit training in more limited scenarios.

- The paper provides comprehensive results spanning direct-cast inference, finetuned inference, post-training quantization, and full training from scratch. This explores a wider range of use cases compared to papers that focus on just one or two of these aspects.

- The empirical results cover a diverse set of models including CNNs, transformers, RNNs across language, vision, speech, and recommender systems. Many related papers have results on a smaller subset of applications.

- Training very large transformer models with 4-bit weights and 6-bit activations/gradients is shown for the first time. Most prior work has not demonstrated generative model training below 6-8 bits.
