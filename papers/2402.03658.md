## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED), which aims to generate a natural language explanation for a given sarcastic dialogue involving multiple modalities (text, video, audio). Prior work on SED using models like BART overlook the sentiment information in the utterances, video and audio, which provides vital clues for sarcasm explanation. Incorporating such sentiment information into SED is non-trivial due to: (1) diverse effects of utterance tokens on sentiments; (2) gap between video-audio sentiments and BART's embedding space; and (3) complex relations among modalities and their sentiments.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a sentiment-enhanced Graph-based multimodal Sarcasm Explanation framework called EDGE. It has four main components:

(1) Lexicon-guided utterance sentiment inference: Uses BabelSenticNet to extract utterance sentiment. A heuristic strategy is proposed to handle effects of different tokens. 

(2) Video-audio joint sentiment inference: Extends state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis model JCA to predict discrete sentiment labels instead of numeric scores, which better matches BART's embedding space.

(3) Sentiment-enhanced context encoding: Constructs a context-sentiment graph to model semantic relations among modalities and sentiments using graph convolution networks. Both context-oriented and sentiment-oriented relations are modeled.

(4) Sarcasm explanation generation: Feeds the graph representations to BART decoder to generate sarcasm explanation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes incorporating utterance and video-audio sentiments to enhance sarcasm understanding for improving SED performance.
- Devises heuristic utterance sentiment refinement strategy to handle effects of different tokens based on BabelSenticNet.  
- Extends JCA model to predict discrete sentiment labels instead of numeric scores for better multimodal fusion.
- Constructs context-sentiment graph to comprehensively model relations among modalities and their sentiments using GCNs.

Experiments on WITS dataset show EDGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods for SED by a good margin. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of modeling sentiments and semantic relations.
