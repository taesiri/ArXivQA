# [DebugBench: Evaluating Debugging Capability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Debugging is an important skill in programming but the debugging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are relatively unexplored. 
- Prior works evaluating LLM debugging have deficiencies like risk of data leakage, small dataset sizes, lack of bug type diversity, limited model diversity, and constrained scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "DebugBench", a new benchmark for evaluating LLM debugging with over 4,000 instances covering 4 major and 18 minor bug types in 3 programming languages - C++, Java, Python.

- The dataset is constructed by collecting code snippets from LeetCode released after June 2022 and implanting bugs using GPT-4 to avoid data leakage. Stringent automatic filtering based on test suite failures and manual inspection are done.

- Experiments compare debugging capabilities of 2 commercial LLMs - GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and 3 open source LLMs - BLOOM, CodeLlama, CodeLlama-Instruct in zero-shot setting. Additional analyses on multi-sampling, effect of runtime feedback, debugging vs coding difficulty, and their correlation are done.

Key Findings:
- While commercial LLMs lag behind human performance, open source models fail to produce any meaningful responses.
- Debugging performance varies markedly across bug types - syntax and reference bugs are simpler than logical and multiple bugs.  
- Runtime feedback helps for syntax/reference bugs but not logical bugs.
- For commercial models, debugging is easier than coding for syntax/reference bugs but equally hard or harder for logical/multiple bugs. Their debugging and coding capabilities are also correlated.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of LLMs' debugging abilities using DebugBench dataset with diversity in data sources, bug types, models, and scenarios.
- Findings on performance variation across models and bug types, and effect of techniques like runtime feedback.
- Analysis of interplay between debugging and coding capabilities of LLMs.

The paper delivers valuable insights into strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in debugging different types of errors. The findings can guide developing more skilled coding assistants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces DebugBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the debugging capabilities of large language models, consisting of over 4,000 instances across 18 bug types in 3 programming languages, and uses it to assess commercial and open-source models, finding significant gaps compared to human performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of DebugBench, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating the debugging capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- DebugBench contains over 4,000 code snippet debugging examples covering 4 major categories and 18 minor types of bugs in C++, Java, and Python. This provides more comprehensive bug type coverage compared to prior debugging datasets.

- The examples in DebugBench are collected from recent LeetCode submissions and the bugs are synthetically generated, reducing the risk of test data leakage found in other debugging datasets.

- The paper presents an empirical study evaluating both commercial LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as well as open source models on DebugBench in zero-shot settings. This reveals and compares their debugging abilities across different programming languages and error types.

- The analysis shows areas where LLMs still fall short of human-level debugging performance, specifically in handling logic errors and multiple concurrent bugs. It also examines the correlation between debugging skill and code generation capabilities.

So in summary, DebugBench enables more rigorous debugging evaluation of LLMs, revealing strengths, weaknesses, and correlations that can guide future model development and training in this space.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Debugging - The main focus of the paper is evaluating the debugging capabilities of large language models.

- DebugBench - The name of the benchmark dataset introduced in the paper for evaluating LLM debugging skills. It contains over 4,000 buggy code examples.

- Data leakage - A key concern when creating evaluation datasets is avoiding data leakage from the training data of the models being tested.

- Bug taxonomy - The paper categorizes programming bugs into 4 major and 18 minor types as part of DebugBench. 

- Zero-shot evaluation - The models are evaluated on DebugBench in a zero-shot setting without additional training.

- Commercial vs open-source models - The paper tested both commercial models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as well as open-source models like CodeLLama and BLOOM.

- Human evaluation - Human programmers are also evaluated on DebugBench to establish human performance levels. 

- Pass rate metric - The percentage of buggy examples successfully fixed is the main evaluation metric.

- Runtime feedback - Providing runtime error information is tested as an additional input to understand its impact.

So in summary - debugging, benchmarking, evaluation, bug taxonomy, data leakage, commercial/open source models, zero-shot learning etc. are some of the key terms relevant to this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions employing GPT-4 for bug implantation. What techniques did the authors use to ensure the quality and diversity of bugs synthesized by GPT-4? Were there any filtering criteria or constraints imposed on the model?

2. DebugBench contains over 4,000 instances across 18 bug types. What informed the authors' choice of this scale and taxonomy of bugs? How did they validate that it provides sufficient coverage? 

3. The paper compares debugging performance on closed vs open source models. Why do you think such a stark gap exists between them? What factors unique to closed source models might explain their superior debugging capabilities?

4. Human evaluators significantly outperformed even the best language models on DebugBench. What advantages do you think humans leverage that models currently lack? How can we close this gap?

5. The paper finds runtime feedback helps for some bugs but not others. What underlying reasons could explain why tracebacks are unhelpful for logical errors? How might models better utilize runtime information?  

6. The analysis reveals debugging is easier than coding for syntax/reference bugs but equally hard for logical/multiple bugs. Why might this discrepancy exist? What makes logical errors inherently more challenging?

7. DebugBench instances are artificially generated. How well do you think performance on DebugBench translates to real-world code? What steps could be taken to strengthen the benchmark's applicability?

8. The paper links debugging and coding performance in closed source models. What common capabilities might underpin both tasks? Why doesn't this correlation hold for open source models?  

9. What other analyses could the authors have conducted on model debugging behavior, either qualitatively or quantitatively? What factors remain unexplored?

10. The paper focuses on snippet-level bugs. How suitable do you think the proposed approach is for handling repository-scale bugs? What adaptations would it require?
