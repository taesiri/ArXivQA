# [BMLP: Behavior-aware MLP for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In real-world recommendation scenarios, user behaviors are heterogeneous (e.g. clicks, purchases). Existing methods have limitations in modeling the complex dependencies between different user behaviors. 
- It's difficult to accurately predict what a user will purchase next based on a heterogeneous sequence containing both target purchase behaviors and auxiliary behaviors like clicks or favorites.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel MLP-based method called Behavior-aware MLP (BMLP) for heterogeneous sequential recommendation.

- BMLP has two main modules:
   - Heterogeneous Interest Perception (HIP) module: Models user behaviors at multiple granularities by considering behavior types and transition relationships. This captures fine-grained user interest dependencies.
   - Purchase Intent Perception (PIP) module: Adaptively aggregates recent auxiliary behavior subsequences (e.g. clicks) to capture a user's dynamic purchase intent.

- These two complementary modules are fused to make the final purchase prediction.

Main Contributions:

- First MLP-based method for heterogeneous sequential recommendation that is simple, efficient and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- Two well-designed modules in BMLP that comprehensively model a user's purchasing habits:
   - HIP models dependencies between behaviors from a multi-granularity perspective
   - PIP focuses on recent auxiliary behaviors that influence purchase intent

- Significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel yet simple MLP-based approach to effectively tackle the heterogeneous sequential recommendation problem by perceiving both multi-granularity user interests and dynamic purchase intent.
