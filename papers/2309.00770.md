# [Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like text. However, they can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases against marginalized groups. This paper surveys the landscape of techniques to evaluate and mitigate biases in LLMs.

Key Concepts: 
The authors consolidate notions of bias and fairness for NLP tasks. Biases manifest distinctly for different tasks; key harms include misrepresentation, disparate performance, and toxicity. Fairness aims for parity in outcomes between social groups. The authors define metrics, datasets, and mitigation techniques used to assess and reduce bias.  

Solutions - Taxonomies:
1) Metrics evaluate bias in model internals like embeddings or output text using classifiers. 
2) Datasets contain input sentences with perturbed social groups to test invariance.
3) Mitigation techniques intervene at different stages of the LLM pipeline - data pre-processing, model training, inference modifications, or output post-processing.

Contributions:
- Formalizes distinct facets of bias and proposes initial fairness criteria for LLMs 
- Develops taxonomies of metrics, datasets, and mitigation techniques based on type of intervention
- Consolidates publicly available datasets into an open benchmark
- Surveys a wide range of techniques with mathematical formalization for improved clarity
- Outlines open challenges around conceptualizing fairness, evaluation rigor, technique effectiveness, and theoretical limits

By clearly defining the bias problem, organizing prior techniques, and distilling open issues, this paper provides a valuable guide for fairness research on LLMs. Key next steps entail centering impacted communities, establishing more rigorous evaluation, and exploring hybrid mitigation methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive survey of metrics, datasets, and techniques for evaluating and mitigating social bias in large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the study of bias and fairness in large language models:

1) It consolidates, formalizes, and expands notions of social bias and fairness specifically for natural language processing. This includes defining distinct facets of harm that can arise from language models and proposing an initial set of fairness desiderata to make fairness operational for LLMs. 

2) It provides three taxonomies to organize the literature: (i) a taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation, categorizing them by the underlying data structure they assume; (ii) a taxonomy of datasets for bias evaluation, categorized by their structure as counterfactual inputs or prompts; and (iii) a taxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation, classified by their intervention stage such as pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing.

3) It identifies and releases a compilation of publicly-available bias evaluation datasets to improve access.

4) It discusses several open problems and challenges to guide future research, including addressing power imbalances in LLM development, conceptualizing fairness more robustly for NLP, improving bias evaluation principles and standards, expanding mitigation efforts, and exploring theoretical limits for fairness guarantees.

In summary, this paper aims to provide a clear conceptualization of bias and fairness considerations for LLMs, a systematic organization and unification of the recent abundance of literature across metrics, datasets, and mitigation techniques, and an outline of tangible directions to further this important area of research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper on bias and fairness in large language models:

1. The paper proposes taxonomies for bias evaluation metrics, datasets, and mitigation techniques. How do you think these taxonomies could be expanded or refined in future work to capture emerging trends? For instance, are there additional categories you would add?

2. The mitigation taxonomy classifies techniques into pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing stages. Do you think new hybrid techniques that intervene at multiple stages may be more effective? Why or why not? 

3. The paper discusses trade-offs between performance and fairness for in-training mitigation techniques. What theoretical frameworks could be used to better characterize these trade-offs? How might the trade-offs differ for other mitigation stages?

4. The paper defines a set of initial fairness desiderata for language generation tasks. How else might fairness be conceptualized for natural language beyond the proposed notions of group and individual fairness? What alternative definitions are needed?

5. What open theoretical questions remain regarding guarantees for bias mitigation techniques? For instance, can theoretical upper and lower bounds be placed on the amount of bias that can be removed? 

6. The paper finds that bias encoded in embeddings may not transfer to downstream tasks. What hypotheses might explain this weak relationship? How should it inform future embedding-based and probability-based evaluation metrics?

7. What empirical comparisons between the effectiveness of different mitigation techniques are still needed? What evaluation frameworks and baseline models can enable standardized assessment?

8. How might the taxonomies of evaluation metrics and datasets be used by practitioners to select appropriate techniques for their setting and nnotation? What additional information could guide selection?

9. The paper argues benchmark datasets may fail to capture real-world harms. What alternative testing paradigms beyond benchmarks should be further explored for more ecologically valid bias evaluation? 

10. What participatory research frameworks and community-based approaches could be used to bring marginalized groups into the process of building, evaluating and deploying large language models? How might these frameworks establish alternative sets of values and assumptions in language technology development?
