# [Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like text. However, they can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases against marginalized groups. This paper surveys the landscape of techniques to evaluate and mitigate biases in LLMs.

Key Concepts: 
The authors consolidate notions of bias and fairness for NLP tasks. Biases manifest distinctly for different tasks; key harms include misrepresentation, disparate performance, and toxicity. Fairness aims for parity in outcomes between social groups. The authors define metrics, datasets, and mitigation techniques used to assess and reduce bias.  

Solutions - Taxonomies:
1) Metrics evaluate bias in model internals like embeddings or output text using classifiers. 
2) Datasets contain input sentences with perturbed social groups to test invariance.
3) Mitigation techniques intervene at different stages of the LLM pipeline - data pre-processing, model training, inference modifications, or output post-processing.

Contributions:
- Formalizes distinct facets of bias and proposes initial fairness criteria for LLMs 
- Develops taxonomies of metrics, datasets, and mitigation techniques based on type of intervention
- Consolidates publicly available datasets into an open benchmark
- Surveys a wide range of techniques with mathematical formalization for improved clarity
- Outlines open challenges around conceptualizing fairness, evaluation rigor, technique effectiveness, and theoretical limits

By clearly defining the bias problem, organizing prior techniques, and distilling open issues, this paper provides a valuable guide for fairness research on LLMs. Key next steps entail centering impacted communities, establishing more rigorous evaluation, and exploring hybrid mitigation methods.
