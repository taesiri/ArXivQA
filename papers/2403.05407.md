# [Algorithmic Identification of Essential Exogenous Nodes for Causal   Sufficiency in Brain Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Causal sufficiency assumption is critical for accurately inferring causality in brain networks, but often overlooked in studies. Violating this can lead to spurious connections. 
- Focusing only on smaller brain networks in isolation risks missing confounders from outside networks that violate causal sufficiency. 
- Existing causal discovery methods have poor performance on large networks, yet need large networks to satisfy causal sufficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop algorithm to identify essential exogenous confounding nodes to include for causal sufficiency when analyzing smaller networks. Enables using high-performance causal methods on smaller networks without violating assumption.

- Runs 3 main steps:
   1) Conditional/unconditional independence tests like PC algorithm 
   2) Use differences in tests with/without candidate confounders (KS test) to find candidates
   3) Apply NF-iVAE to candidates and use CCI metric to identify true confounders

- Evaluate approach on HCP movie-watching data for visual and attention networks.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel algorithm for discovering essential exogenous confounders for causal sufficiency

2) Apply approach to HCP data, identify confounders consistent with neuroscience literature (e.g. dorsal regions for visual)  

3) Demonstrate reliability through 30 NF-iVAE runs - approach consistently ranks same nodes highest for relevance


The summary covers the key problem being addressed regarding causal sufficiency in brain networks, the proposed 3-step algorithmic solution and independence test approach to identify essential confounding variables, the evaluation on HCP data and finding dorsal/ventral confounders for visual/attention networks, and the main contributions around the algorithm itself and its demonstrated ability to reliably identify relevant confounding nodes.
