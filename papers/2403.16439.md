# [Producing and Leveraging Online Map Uncertainty in Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High-definition (HD) maps are critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) but they are costly to create and maintain. Recently, methods have been proposed to estimate HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of pre-mapped regions. 
- However, current online mapping methods do not provide uncertainty estimates, making it difficult to integrate them into downstream AV modules like trajectory prediction. Lack of uncertainty representation causes issues such as prediction models implicitly assuming map estimates are certain even if they are inaccurate or contain errors.

Proposed Solution:
- Extend multiple state-of-the-art online vectorized HD mapping methods (MapTR, MapTRv2, StreamMapNet) to additionally output location and classification uncertainty for map elements like lanes, boundaries, etc. This is done by modifying the output heads to model point locations as Laplace distributions and expose classification logits.
- Incorporate the map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction models like HiVT and DenseTNT by encoding both mean location and uncertainty parameters of map points. This allows the prediction models to adjust behaviors based on uncertainty.

Main Contributions:
- A general formulation to extend vectorized HD mapping methods to produce location and classification uncertainty estimates for map elements
- Analysis of various sources of uncertainty captured like occlusions, distance to camera, lighting conditions 
- Combining online mapping methods with trajectory prediction models and showing incorporating map uncertainty speeds up training convergence by up to 50% and improves prediction accuracy by up to 15% on nuScenes dataset

The key insight is that providing uncertainty estimates from online mapping enables better integration with downstream AV modules, improving performance and behaviors based on awareness of unreliable map estimates.
