# [Probing Structured Semantics Understanding and Generation of Language   Models via Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in evaluating their capabilities, but their ability to understand structured semantics is rarely explored. 
- Existing works probe superficial linguistic properties rather than deep semantic structures.
- Evaluating deep semantic understanding is important to determine boundaries of LLMs' language comprehension.

Solution:
- The paper proposes using formal languages like Lambda DCS, SPARQL and KoPL as a medium to probe LLMs' understanding of structured semantics.
- Two sub-tasks are defined: (1) Formal Language Understanding - Translating logical forms to natural language questions. (2) Formal Language Generation - Mapping natural language questions back to logical forms.  
- In-context learning is used by providing demonstration logical form - question pairs to prompt the LLM to generate the target output. Carefully designed search strategies retrieve similar demonstrations.
- Indirect evaluation measures quality by training parsers on LLM-generated data and comparing performance to human-labeled parser.

Key Findings:
- LLMs exhibit a gap compared to humans in structured semantics, especially in generation ability.  
- Larger LLMs perform better in both understanding and generation tasks.
- Models are sensitive to different formal languages - those more similar to natural language are more LM-friendly.
- Performance differences suggest combining LLMs and knowledge bases can help in complex reasoning tasks.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel probing of deep semantic structures using formal languages 
- Extensive experiments quantifying understanding gap between LLMs and humans
- Analysis of LM sensitivity across logical languages and insights on how to pick LLM-friendly languages
- Findings suggest feasibility of LLM-knowledge base combinations for reasoning


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper probes the ability of large language models to understand and generate structured semantics, specifically logical forms, for complex question answering over knowledge bases. The models exhibit decent understanding capability but weaker generation ability, with performance varying across different logical languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is using formal languages to probe the deep structure understanding of natural language in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the authors:

1) Implement the inter-conversion of natural and formal language through in-context learning of LLMs to verify their ability to understand and generate structured logical forms. 

2) Select three representative formal languages - Lambda DCS, SPARQL, and KoPL with varying degrees of formalization and different logical structures.

3) Define two sub-tasks for probing - formal language understanding (translating logical forms to natural language questions) and formal language generation (converting natural language questions to logical forms).

4) Conduct extensive experiments with LLMs of different sizes on the two tasks and analyze their capabilities and limitations in understanding and generating logical forms. 

5) Discover that while LLMs can approach human-level performance in understanding logical forms, their generation abilities are much weaker. The level of formalization also impacts performance.

In summary, the main contribution is using formal languages and defined probing tasks to systematically evaluate the structured semantics understanding and generation capacities of current state-of-the-art LLMs. The analysis provides insights into the deep language comprehension of LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on evaluating the capabilities of large language models like BERT, GPT, T5, etc.

- Formal languages: The paper utilizes formal languages like Lambda DCS, SPARQL, and KoPL to probe the deep structure understanding of LLMs. These serve as the medium to test understanding and generation abilities.

- Question answering (QA): The paper uses QA with formal languages as the main probing task to evaluate LLMs' capabilities. This includes tasks like formal language understanding and formal language generation.

- Deep structure understanding: A key goal of the paper is assessing LLMs' comprehension of the deeper semantics and structured meaning of language through the use of formal languages, beyond just surface form properties.

- In-context learning: The paper relies on the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to generate natural language questions or logical forms based on demonstration examples provided in the input context.

- Knowledge bases: Some of the formal languages are designed for querying knowledge bases, which allows probing the reasoning capacities of LLMs when combined with external knowledge.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around using formal languages and question answering with LLMs to evaluate their proficiency in deeper semantics understanding and reasoning over knowledge bases.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the choice of formal language for probing impact the evaluation results? Does using multiple formal languages give a more comprehensive assessment of deep structure understanding compared to using just one?

2. What are the limitations of using question answering accuracy as an evaluation metric for the quality of generated natural language questions? Could there be cases where the questions are not fluent but still lead to correct answers? 

3. The paper argues it is more effective to use LLMs to generate training data than to directly answer questions. Is there an optimal combination? Could a hybrid approach utilize the strengths of both?

4. How sensitive are the results to the choice of demonstration examples and the search strategy used? Is the performance gap between understanding and generation partly explained by suboptimal example selection?  

5. The paper identifies the level of formalization as an important criteria determining model friendliness of a formal language. What other criteria matter and how can new formal languages be designed accordingly?

6. The evaluation relies on existing parsers and datasets. How would building custom parsers and datasets focused on assessing deep structure understanding impact conclusions?

7. What types of logical errors are most prevalent in the generated formal languages? Are there any discernible patterns and implications for model architecture?

8. Is the relative performance difference between understanding and generation consistent across different types of reasoning questions - qualitative, quantitative, temporal, logical, etc.?

9. How do models that incorporate knowledge bases and retrieve demonstrations compare to the in-context learning approach evaluated? Do the conclusions change?

10. The paper studies question answering but how do findings transfer to other NL tasks? Is deep structure understanding in generation vs understanding comparable for machine translation, summarization, etc.?
