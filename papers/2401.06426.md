## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:

- Employs genetic search to find optimal subnets based on pruning criteria like number of blocks pruned.
- Proposes a progressive training method to smoothly transfer from baseline to pruned subnet structure, better retaining original weights.
- Introduces a novel block pruning approach that can handle multiple normalization layers by replacements.
- Applies reparameterization technique to merge layers and skip connections, reducing depth.

Main Contributions:
- Unified depth optimization framework for both CNN and vision transformer models.
- Progressive subnet finetuning strategy coupled with novel block pruning method using reparameterization.  
- State-of-the-art pruning results across ResNet, MobileNetV2, ConvNeXt, and DeiT models, with 3 pruned ConvNeXt models surpassing most efficient CNN/transformers.
- Analysis of subnet search and progressive training benefits.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective depth pruning approach for optimizing efficient CNN and vision transformer models, achieving leading results across various models. The core ideas include smoothly finetuning subnets and a block pruning strategy friendly to multiple normalization layers.
