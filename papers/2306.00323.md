# Thought Cloning: Learning to Think while Acting by Imitating Human   Thinking

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can training AI agents to imitate human thinking, in addition to just imitating behaviors, produce agents that are smarter, safer, and more interpretable? The key hypothesis is that by training agents to generate natural language thoughts like humans do while acting, and then conditioning their actions on those thoughts, the agents will gain many of the benefits that language provides to human thinking. These hypothesized benefits include faster learning, better generalization, enhanced abilities to plan, replan, and adapt to novel situations, as well as improved interpretability and safety.The paper introduces a novel imitation learning framework called "Thought Cloning" to test this hypothesis. The goal is to not just clone human behaviors like in traditional behavioral cloning, but to also clone the thoughts humans have while acting. The paper validates the potential of Thought Cloning in a synthetic domain meant to simulate having large datasets of real human thinking aligned with actions.In summary, the central research question is whether imitating human thinking in addition to behaviors can produce smarter, safer, more interpretable agents. The key hypothesis is that thinking in language will provide agents cognitive benefits similar to those it provides humans. The Thought Cloning framework is introduced to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Imitation Learning framework called Thought Cloning, where agents learn to not just imitate the behaviors of human demonstrators like in regular Behavioral Cloning, but also imitate the thoughts humans have while acting. The key idea is that learning to think like humans, in natural language, can provide significant benefits in terms of making AI agents more capable, safer, and more interpretable. Some of the key contributions and main ideas are:- Introducing the Thought Cloning framework, where agents have two components: an Upper-Level Component that generates thoughts in language, and a Lower-Level Component that acts based on those thoughts.- Training agents with a synchronized dataset of human thoughts and actions, so the agents learn to think and act like the demonstrations. - Showing experimentally that Thought Cloning agents outperform Behavioral Cloning agents, especially on out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting their improved generalization.- Demonstrating benefits in terms of AI Safety and Interpretability from being able to understand the agent's thoughts. For example, they introduce a "Precrime Intervention" method that can prevent unsafe behaviors by detecting problematic plans in the agent's thoughts before execution.- Discussing the potential of Thought Cloning trained on vast datasets of humans thinking aloud while acting, like YouTube gameplay videos. The human thinking provides information about planning, exploration, reasoning that is difficult to learn otherwise.- Validating Thought Cloning in the BabyAI domain with synthetic thought data, as a proof of concept before application to large real-world datasets.In summary, the key idea is training agents to not just imitate behaviors, but also imitate human thinking, which can make AI systems much more capable, safe, and interpretable. The introduction of the Thought Cloning framework and experimental validation of its benefits are the main contributions.
