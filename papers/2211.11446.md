# [SMAUG: Sparse Masked Autoencoder for Efficient Video-Language   Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11446)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How can we efficiently pre-train powerful video-language representation models while significantly reducing their pre-training computational cost?The key points are:- Video-language pre-training with large datasets is crucial for learning effective multi-modal representations but requires massive computation. - The paper proposes an efficient video-language pre-training framework called SMAUG to reduce pre-training cost while maintaining strong performance.- SMAUG is built on masked autoencoders which operate on partial visible patches. This is more efficient than standard pre-training.- On top of that, SMAUG introduces modules to remove spatial and temporal redundancies in the visible patches, further improving efficiency. - Experiments show SMAUG can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art video-language models while requiring much less pre-training computation (1.9x speedup).So in summary, the central question is how to develop an efficient video-language pre-training framework that significantly reduces computation cost while maintaining strong performance. SMAUG aims to address this problem through masked autoencoding and redundancy removal.
