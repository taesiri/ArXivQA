# [AURA: Natural Language Reasoning for Aleatoric Uncertainty in Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rationales (explanations for answers) are useful for improving language model performance on reasoning tasks, but perfect rationales are often impossible to obtain. 
- The inherent randomness and diversity of rationales makes their patterns difficult for models to learn.
- Dealing with imperfect, ambiguous rationales is an important challenge for faithful reasoning.

Proposed Solution - AURA:  
- Quantify ambiguity of rationales by calculating entropy scores using model prior vs posterior beliefs. High entropy indicates more ambiguity.  
- Split data into unambiguous vs ambiguous rationales based on entropy threshold.
- Use two-stage reasoning system:
   - Reasoning 1: Train on all data to get posterior belief distribution
   - Reasoning 2: Retrain model on ambiguous rationales to focus on hard cases
- Ensemble predictions from two models according to rationale ambiguity

Main Contributions:
- Formalize and quantify ambiguity/aleatoric uncertainty in rationales using information theory
- Propose AURA method to select reasoning approach based on rationale ambiguity
- Empirically show AURA improves performance over baselines, especially for out-of-distribution generalization
- Demonstrate importance of reasoning approach over quality of rationales alone
- Provide analysis showing AURA improves prediction confidence and error rates

In summary, the paper tackles the challenging problem of handling ambiguous rationales for language model reasoning. It proposes a novel AURA technique to quantify ambiguity and adapt the reasoning approach accordingly. Key results show significant gains in model generalization and robustness to rationale quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called AURA for dealing with the inherent ambiguity in rationales for question answering by using rationale entropy to divide them into ambiguous and unambiguous groups and train separate reasoning models on each group.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called AURA to deal with imperfect, ambiguous rationales in natural language reasoning tasks. Specifically:

- The paper defines a way to quantify the ambiguity/uncertainty of rationales using entropy scores calculated from the model's prior and posterior beliefs. Rationales with high entropy are considered ambiguous.

- The paper proposes AURA, which is a two-stage reasoning approach to handle the ambiguity in rationales. It first trains a standard reasoning model on all data. Then it trains a second reasoning model focused on the ambiguous rationales identified by the entropy measure. 

- Through experiments, the paper shows AURA leads to performance gains compared to prior pipeline rationalization methods, especially in out-of-distribution and low-resource settings. This suggests AURA produces more robust and generalized reasoning.

In summary, the key contribution is using rationale entropy to identify ambiguous rationales and handling them with a two-stage reasoning approach to achieve more reliable and generalizable natural language reasoning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Rationales - Explanations for model decisions that can improve language model reasoning. However, obtaining perfect rationales is often impossible.

- Aleatoric uncertainty - Uncertainty inherent in the data/observations. Captures ambiguity or noisiness in rationales.

- Entropy - Used to define ambiguous rationales by calculating entropy scores of rationales using model prior and posterior beliefs.

- Two-stage reasoning - Proposed method where models are first trained on all data, then retrained on ambiguous rationale subsets. Helps optimize reasoning. 

- Faithfulness - Ability of models to reason properly and not just memorize patterns. AURA aims to improve faithfulness.

- Generalization - Ability of models to perform well on unseen data. AURA shows strong generalization ability.

- In-distribution vs out-of-distribution - AURA evaluated on in-distribution (same distribution for train and test) and out-of-distribution (different distributions for train and test)

- Low-resource settings - AURA shows strong performance even with limited training data.

The key ideas focus on dealing with uncertainty in rationales to improve model faithfulness, generalization, and low-resource performance for reasoning tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper defines "rationale entropy" to quantify the ambiguity of rationales. How exactly is this entropy calculation done? What are the key components it compares to estimate entropy?

2. The paper proposes a two-stage reasoning system to deal with uncertain rationales. Can you explain the difference in training procedures between Reasoning 1 and Reasoning 2 models? Why is training them differently beneficial?  

3. The ablation study in Table 2 shows that removing Reasoning 1 causes a huge performance drop while removing Reasoning 2 does not. What does this imply about the roles of the two reasoning models?

4. Figure 3 shows that the proposed AURA method has the best confidence score distribution between correct and incorrect answers. Why is having clear confidence separation for the model predictions important?

5. The paper argues reasoning matters more than rationalization for overall performance. Based on the results, can you elaborate why this is the case? What role do quality rationales play?

6. How exactly does the proposed AURA method help improve out-of-distribution generalization compared to other baseline methods? What causes this improved capability?

7. Is the performance boost by AURA more prominent when the rationales used are human-written or machine-generated? What might be the reason?

8. The paper utilizes model prior knowledge as a measure of informativeness when calculating rationale entropy. Why is using model priors reasonable in this context?

9. Could the proposed rationale entropy measure be useful for other natural language processing tasks dealing with ambiguity? What kind of tasks could benefit?

10. What are some limitations of using rationale entropy to quantify ambiguity? When might this approach fail or have disadvantages?
