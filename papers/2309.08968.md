# [Sorted LLaMA: Unlocking the Potential of Intermediate Layers of Large   Language Models for Dynamic Inference Using Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) across layers to optimize their usage, leveraging their inherent modularity, without incurring substantial additional costs?More specifically, the key questions investigated are:i) Do the intermediate layers resulting from Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of an LLM generate accurate and meaningful outputs? ii) Does SFT exhibit a sorted behavior, with later layers producing more accurate outputs than earlier layers?iii) How can we enhance this sorted behavior with minimal cost?The authors' main hypothesis seems to be that the conventional reliance solely on the last layer's outputs is suboptimal, and that the potential of intermediate layers can be unlocked to optimize LLM efficiency and performance across layers. They propose applying Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT) in place of SFT to test this hypothesis.In summary, this paper centers around investigating and improving the representation learning and generative capabilities of intermediate layers in LLMs through an efficient tuning approach, challenging the standard practice of only leveraging the last layer.
