# [Robust Active Measuring under Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a standard model for sequential decision making. However, they assume full knowledge of environment dynamics and system states, which is often unrealistic. 
- Partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) address state uncertainty by introducing an observation model, but assume the dynamics are still known.
- Robust MDPs (RMDPs) handle model uncertainty by representing the transition function as uncertainty sets, but assume full state observability. 
- Combining partial observability and model uncertainty leads to robust POMDPs (RPOMDPs), which have seen limited study so far due to computational complexity.

Solution:
- The paper focuses on a subset of RPOMDPs with active measurement actions, called robust active-measuring MDPs (RAM-MDPs). 
- Measurements provide full state information at a cost. The goal is to balance the cost and value of measuring.
- A heuristic called robust act-then-measure (RATM) is proposed. It plans control actions assuming future observability while planning measurements assuming future uncertainty. This separation enables efficient planning.  
- To prevent overly conservative measuring policies, a strategy called measurement leniency is introduced. It allows extra measurements based on less pessimistic planning models, while keeping the same robust control policy.

Contributions:  
- Formal definition of RAM-MDPs to model active measuring under model uncertainty
- Key insight that model uncertainty changes the dependence of worst-case transitions on measuring actions
- Efficient RATM heuristic to solve a subset of RAM-MDPs by separating robust control from measuring planning 
- Measurement leniency strategy to alleviate overly conservative measuring
- Empirical evaluation showing efficiency, scalability and improved robustness over baselines

The paper makes RAM-MDPs more tractable to solve by making reasonable assumptions. Measurement leniency also counteracts robust optimization's tendency to discourage measuring. Together, this enables scalable decision making with active sensing in uncertain environments.
