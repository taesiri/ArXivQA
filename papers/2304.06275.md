# [Noisy Correspondence Learning with Meta Similarity Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06275)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn cross-modal retrieval with noisy correspondence. 

The key points are:

- Existing cross-modal retrieval methods rely on correct correspondence between modalities (e.g. image-text pairs). However, real-world datasets often contain mismatched/noisy pairs due to collection errors. 

- Training on such noisy datasets degrades performance, as models wrongly enforce mismatched data to be similar.

- This paper proposes a meta-learning based approach called Meta Similarity Correction Network (MSCN) to provide reliable similarity scores and robustly train from noisy correspondence.

- A novel meta-process is designed to train the MSCN to discriminate between matched and mismatched pairs, using a small set of clean data. 

- An effective data purification strategy is proposed using meta-data to remove potentially noisy samples.

- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods under different noise levels on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that meta-learning and data purification can help learn robust cross-modal representations from noisy correspondence. The MSCN method is proposed to validate this hypothesis.
