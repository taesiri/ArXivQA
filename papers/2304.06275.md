# [Noisy Correspondence Learning with Meta Similarity Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06275)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn cross-modal retrieval with noisy correspondence. 

The key points are:

- Existing cross-modal retrieval methods rely on correct correspondence between modalities (e.g. image-text pairs). However, real-world datasets often contain mismatched/noisy pairs due to collection errors. 

- Training on such noisy datasets degrades performance, as models wrongly enforce mismatched data to be similar.

- This paper proposes a meta-learning based approach called Meta Similarity Correction Network (MSCN) to provide reliable similarity scores and robustly train from noisy correspondence.

- A novel meta-process is designed to train the MSCN to discriminate between matched and mismatched pairs, using a small set of clean data. 

- An effective data purification strategy is proposed using meta-data to remove potentially noisy samples.

- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods under different noise levels on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that meta-learning and data purification can help learn robust cross-modal representations from noisy correspondence. The MSCN method is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a Meta Similarity Correction Network (MSCN) to provide reliable similarity scores for noisy cross-modal data. The MSCN is trained in a meta-learning framework to learn to discriminate between matched and mismatched multimodal pairs.

- It utilizes both positive and negative meta-data to guide the training of MSCN. Positive pairs encourage it to give high similarity scores to matched data, while negative pairs containing mismatched data teach it to give low scores for incorrect pairs. 

- It presents a novel meta-training process that poses binary classification on meta-data as the meta-objective to train the MSCN. This enables the network's outputs to naturally represent similarity scores.

- It designs a meta-knowledge guided data purification strategy to remove potentially noisy samples using the MSCN's similarity scores. This further alleviates the influence of noise during training.

- Extensive experiments on three datasets with both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.

In summary, the key contribution is using meta-learning to train a network to predict reliable similarity scores for noisy multimodal data, which enables robust cross-modal retrieval learning. The meta-training process and data purification strategy help further improve noise tolerance.
