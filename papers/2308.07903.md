# [Relightable and Animatable Neural Avatar from Sparse-View Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07903)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to create photorealistic, animatable and relightable avatars from sparse-view (or monocular) video inputs of humans under unknown natural illumination. 

Specifically, the paper aims to address the challenge of reconstructing not just the geometry and appearance of humans from sparse video footage, but also recovering the material properties like albedo and roughness to enable relighting the avatars under novel illumination conditions. This is an ill-posed inverse rendering problem due to the ambiguity in geometry, materials and motion from limited input views.

The key hypothesis is that by designing a novel hierarchical distance query scheme and incorporating differentiable soft visibility computation, the paper can achieve efficient and accurate estimation of geometry, materials and lighting to generate animatable and relightable avatars from sparse inputs. The hierarchical distance query allows approximating world space distances for reliable sphere tracing on the posed avatar, while soft visibility handled by extending distance field soft shadows enables realistic shading effects under area lights.

In summary, the central research question is how to create photorealistic avatars that can be reposed and relit from sparse video inputs, which is addressed through innovations in hierarchical distance queries and differentiable visibility computation for inverse rendering. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on both real and synthetic datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to create relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse-view or monocular videos of dynamic humans under unknown illumination. 

Specifically, the key innovations are:

1. Designing a hierarchical distance query (HDQ) algorithm that enables efficient and consistent approximation of world space distances to the neural avatar surface under arbitrary poses. This allows performing sphere tracing for pixel-surface intersection and light visibility computation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- It tackles a very challenging problem of creating animatable and relightable avatars from sparse input videos. Previous work has focused on either animatable avatars or relightable reconstruction, but not both together from such limited input data.

- The method is built upon recent neural rendering techniques like NeRF and neural radiance fields, but innovates with the hierarchical distance query scheme to enable efficient relighting. This is a novel contribution compared to prior work.

- Most related work has focused on controlled studio capture or used only static images/objects. This paper pushes the boundaries by working with sparse real-world video of dynamic humans, captured with uncontrolled illumination.

- Compared to methods that rely on explicit geometry and textures, the neural representation here can produce avatars that are more detailed, photorealistic, and editable. The avatars can also easily animate to novel poses.

- The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods like AniSDF and Relighting4D. The comparisons on real and synthetic data are quite thorough.

- The hierarchical distance query scheme is an elegant solution to enable relighting of deformable avatars, overcoming issues with applying sphere tracing directly to deformed SDFs.

- Extending traditional DFSS techniques to enable soft shadows on neural SDFs is also an interesting innovation for improving realism.

Overall, I would summarize that this paper pushes the boundaries of neural avatar creation, achieving animatable, relightable results from very limited and challenging real-world data. The methodological innovations and thorough experiments demonstrate improvements over other recent work in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring more efficient methods for visibility computation. The current soft visibility computation still relies on sphere tracing, which is time consuming. The authors suggest investigating alternative approaches like ray marching to improve efficiency.

- Extending the method to handle scenes with dynamic objects and lighting. The current method focuses on reconstructing a single dynamic human. The authors suggest extending it to handle more complex dynamic scenes. This would require handling inter-object occlusion and modeling dynamic lighting.

- Improving the material representation. More complex analytic BRDF models could be incorporated to represent materials more accurately. The current method uses a simple microfacet model.

- Leveraging temporal information. The method currently optimizes each frame independently. The authors suggest utilizing the temporal consistency across video frames during optimization to improve reconstruction quality.

- Accelerating training. The current training takes around 30 hours. Reducing the training time would make the method more practical. The authors suggest exploring model compression and network acceleration techniques.

- Generalizing to real-world data. More testing on complex real videos with natural illumination is needed. The authors collected a real dataset but more evaluation is required.

In summary, the main future directions are improving efficiency, generalization capability, material representation, and leveraging temporal information to handle more complex dynamic real-world scenes. Reducing training time would also make the method more practical.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to reconstruct animatable and relightable neural avatars from sparse-view or monocular videos of humans under unknown illumination. The method represents the human geometry and material properties using neural fields defined in a canonical space, which can be deformed to different poses. To enable relighting, the key innovation is a hierarchical distance query scheme that approximates the distance from 3D points to the avatar surface under arbitrary poses. This allows efficient computation of surface intersections and light visibility via sphere tracing for neural inverse rendering. Experiments demonstrate high-quality avatars on real and synthetic datasets that can be relit with novel illumination and animated to novel poses. The proposed hierarchical distance query enables real-time rendering and outperforms previous methods in reconstruction accuracy. Overall, this is the first system to create animatable, relightable avatars from sparse input, with applications in VR, visual effects, and games.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for creating relightable and animatable human avatars from sparse-view or monocular videos of dynamic humans under unknown illumination. Previous methods can reconstruct animatable avatars from sparse views using deformed Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) but cannot recover material parameters for relighting. While differentiable inverse rendering methods have succeeded in material recovery for static objects, extending them to dynamic humans is challenging due to the computational cost of computing pixel-surface intersections and light visibility on deformed SDFs. 

To address this, the authors propose a Hierarchical Distance Query algorithm to approximate world space distances to the surface under arbitrary poses. This allows using sphere tracing for efficient pixel-surface intersection and light visibility estimation. They also extend Distance Field Soft Shadows to produce realistic soft shadows on the drivable neural SDF. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, physical accuracy, and efficiency. The key innovations are the hierarchical distance query scheme and incorporation of distance field soft shadows, which enable creating high-quality relightable and animatable avatars from sparse input.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for creating relightable and animatable human avatars from sparse-view (or monocular) videos via neural inverse rendering. The method represents the human avatar using neural fields defined in canonical space, including a signed distance field for geometry and MLPs for material properties like albedo and roughness. To enable animation, the canonical representations are warped to world space based on the pose using linear blend skinning and a learned deformation field. To perform differentiable rendering for material estimation, the authors design a hierarchical distance query scheme to approximate world space distances to the avatar surface under arbitrary poses. This allows using sphere tracing for computing pixel-surface intersections and light visibility. The hierarchical distance blending smoothly combines coarse world-space distances based on skinned vertices and fine canonical-space distances from the neural SDF based on proximity. It provides consistent world-space distance values suitable for sphere tracing on the posed avatar. They also extend distance field soft shadows to the drivable neural SDF for approximate soft visibility. The model is trained end-to-end on multi-view video to disentangle materials and geometry, producing relightable avatars that can realistically synthesize novel poses and illumination.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem this paper is addressing are:

- The paper is tackling the challenge of creating relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse-view (or even monocular) videos of dynamic humans under unknown illumination. 

- This is a practical yet challenging setting compared to using sophisticated studio setups with controlled lighting and dense camera arrays. The ambiguity makes it difficult to reconstruct high-quality human avatars that can be realistically relit and animated.

- Previous methods have limitations - they can create animatable avatars from sparse views using neural radiance/distance fields, but cannot recover material properties needed for relighting. Inverse rendering methods can estimate materials for static objects, but are inefficient for animatable humans.

- The core technical problem is efficiently computing pixel-surface intersection and light visibility on deformed neural distance fields to enable material estimation and relighting of dynamic humans. Prior techniques like sphere tracing do not work well on warped distance fields.

- The key innovation is a hierarchical distance query scheme to get consistent distance approximations under arbitrary poses, enabling sphere tracing for intersection and visibility needed by the differentiable renderer. This allows creating the first animatable and relightable avatars from sparse input.

In summary, the paper aims to address the challenging problem of reconstructing relightable, animatable neural human avatars from sparse multi-view or monocular videos, proposing a novel hierarchical distance query technique to enable efficient differentiable rendering.
