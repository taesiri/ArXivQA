# [Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation in Surrogate-based Bayesian   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05153)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification and propagation in surrogate-based modeling. A two-step procedure is introduced consisting of a surrogate training step using simulated data and an inference step using real-world measurements. The framework accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty including simulation noise, limited training data, surrogate approximation error, and measurement noise. Four methods are presented for propagating uncertainty from the training to the inference step: Point estimate, Expected Posterior, Expected Likelihood, and Expected Log-Likelihood. These are evaluated on linear regression and logistic regression case studies. Simulation-based calibration is adapted to validate uncertainty quantification of the overall procedure. The Expected Likelihood and Expected Posterior methods showed improved uncertainty calibration compared to traditional approaches in the case studies. Propagating the full surrogate uncertainty (aleatoric and epistemic) led to wider and better calibrated inference posteriors compared to propagating only parts of it. Overall, the framework enables reliable approximation of expensive simulators while rigorously accounting for different sources of uncertainty.
