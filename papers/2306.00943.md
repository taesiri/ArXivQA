# [Make-Your-Video: Customized Video Generation Using Textual and   Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we achieve customized video generation using both textual and structural guidance for improved controllability? Specifically, the authors propose using text prompts as abstract context descriptions and frame-wise depth maps as concrete motion structure guidance to enable more precise control over synthesized video content. Their method, called Make-Your-Video, involves joint-conditional video generation using a latent diffusion model pre-trained on images and adapted for video with the addition of temporal modules.The key ideas and hypotheses tested in this work are:- Text alone provides global context but may be insufficient for precise control over video content. Combining text prompts with structural guidance like depth maps can improve controllability.- Pre-training a latent diffusion model on images allows transferring rich visual concepts to video generation while keeping training costs manageable. Freezing the pre-trained image model and adding small trainable temporal modules adapts it well for coherent video synthesis.- A causal attention mask enables their model to synthesize longer videos while maintaining quality, by preventing confusion from long-range temporal attention.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging both textual and structural guidance will enable higher-quality, more controllable text-to-video generation, and their method and experiments aim to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It presents an efficient approach for customized video generation using both textual and structural guidance. Specifically, it uses text prompts for context description and frame-wise depth maps to provide motion structure guidance. 2. It proposes a mechanism to leverage pre-trained image latent diffusion models (LDMs) for video generation. This allows the model to inherit rich visual concepts from image datasets while achieving decent temporal coherence on videos.3. It introduces a temporal masking mechanism using causal attention to enable longer video synthesis while mitigating quality degradation. 4. It demonstrates superior performance over existing baselines in terms of temporal coherence and fidelity to the textual and structural guidance. 5. It showcases several applications like video creation from real/3D scenes and video re-rendering to illustrate the potential practical usage.In summary, the key novelty is the joint use of textual and structural guidance for customized controllable video generation, and the efficient adaptation of pre-trained image LDMs to video generation using additional temporal modules and causal attention masking. The results demonstrate improved coherence and guidance fidelity compared to prior arts.
