# [Make-Your-Video: Customized Video Generation Using Textual and   Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we achieve customized video generation using both textual and structural guidance for improved controllability? Specifically, the authors propose using text prompts as abstract context descriptions and frame-wise depth maps as concrete motion structure guidance to enable more precise control over synthesized video content. Their method, called Make-Your-Video, involves joint-conditional video generation using a latent diffusion model pre-trained on images and adapted for video with the addition of temporal modules.The key ideas and hypotheses tested in this work are:- Text alone provides global context but may be insufficient for precise control over video content. Combining text prompts with structural guidance like depth maps can improve controllability.- Pre-training a latent diffusion model on images allows transferring rich visual concepts to video generation while keeping training costs manageable. Freezing the pre-trained image model and adding small trainable temporal modules adapts it well for coherent video synthesis.- A causal attention mask enables their model to synthesize longer videos while maintaining quality, by preventing confusion from long-range temporal attention.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging both textual and structural guidance will enable higher-quality, more controllable text-to-video generation, and their method and experiments aim to demonstrate this.

The results demonstrate improved coherence and guidance fidelity compared to prior arts.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text-to-video synthesis:- This paper focuses on customized video generation using both text prompts and structured guidance in the form of frame-wise depth maps. Using both text and structure as inputs provides more control over the synthesized video compared to methods that use text alone. - The proposed approach builds upon latent diffusion models (LDMs) which were originally designed for efficient text-to-image synthesis. By freezing the image generation components and adding new temporal processing modules, the pre-trained image generation capabilities are transferred to video while maintaining efficiency. This is a clever way to leverage powerful image LDMs for video.- Most prior text-to-video work has focused on generating short videos, often just a few seconds long. A key contribution here is a temporal masking mechanism that enables generating longer videos of 16+ frames while maintaining quality. This expands the practical usefulness.- The two-stage training procedure, first pre-training on images then fine-tuning the temporal components on videos, is an efficient strategy that also improves results by transferring rich visual concepts from large image datasets.- Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to recent text-to-video methods like Make-A-Video, MagicVideo, etc. The videos exhibit better temporal consistency and fidelity to the text+structure inputs.- The method enables creative applications like generating videos from real-world scene setups, 3D scene renders, or re-rendering existing video with changed style/context. This demonstrates the practical utility.In summary, the work pushes state-of-the-art in controllable text-to-video synthesis through innovations in effectively adapting image LDMs for temporally coherent video generation. The results are superior both visually and quantitatively while enabling useful applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Improving the concept customization technique to allow more precise control over the visual appearance in synthesized videos, such as generating videos with specific individuals or objects. The paper notes this is an active area of research in text-to-image synthesis but remains less explored for text-to-video.- Exploring more efficient formulations that require less intensive guidance, such as using sparse keyframe inputs instead of full frame-wise depth maps. This could help broaden the applications of their controllable text-to-video model. - Further enhancing the temporal coherence and video quality for longer video synthesis. The paper introduced a temporal masking mechanism to facilitate longer video generation, but quality degradation still exists. More advanced techniques could be developed.- Applying the video generation framework to other conditional inputs beyond text and depth maps, such as human pose, semantics maps, etc. This could enable new applications.- Improving training efficiency and reducing compute requirements, to make large-scale training more accessible. The two-stage training scheme helped reduce costs but training still remains expensive.- Evaluating the method on more diverse and larger-scale video datasets. The paper relied on a relatively small dataset for evaluation.- Exploring other decoder architectures besides the simple latent-to-RGB decoder used. More advanced decoder designs may further improve video quality.In summary, the main future directions are enhancing customization and control, improving efficiency, scaling up the training and evaluation, and exploring new applications enabled by controllable video generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents an efficient approach for customized video generation using textual and structural guidance. The key idea is to leverage a pre-trained image latent diffusion model (LDM) as the spatial generator and introduce additional temporal modules to adapt it for coherent video synthesis. Specifically, the image LDM is kept frozen to inherit rich visual concepts while temporal blocks are added and trained on video data to model dynamics. Besides using text as context descriptions, frame-wise depth maps are utilized as structural guidance to allow precise control. A temporal masking mechanism is also proposed to enable longer video generation. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over baselines in temporal coherence and conformity to guidance. Overall, this work explores an effective way to transfer image generative priors to video synthesis and shows promising results for controllable text-to-video generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a method for customized video generation using both textual and structural guidance. The key idea is to utilize text prompts to convey the overall context of the video, while also using frame-wise depth maps to provide more concrete control over the motion and structure. The proposed model is based on a latent diffusion model (LDM) that is first pre-trained on image datasets for efficient learning of rich visual concepts. To adapt this for video, temporal modules are introduced to model inter-frame coherence while keeping the image LDM weights frozen. A causal attention mask is also applied to enable longer video generation during inference. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on controllable text-to-video generation. The model enables applications like creating videos from real-world scene setups, 3D scene modeling, and video re-rendering. Overall, this work offers an effective approach to generate customized, temporally coherent videos by combining high-level textual guidance with more precise structural control. The two-stage training scheme transfers rich image concepts while adding video-specific learning.
