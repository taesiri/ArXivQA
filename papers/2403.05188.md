# [CommitBench: A Benchmark for Commit Message Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Writing high-quality commit messages is important for software development but often neglected by developers. Automatically generating commit messages could save time and improve quality.  

- Existing datasets for training/evaluating commit message generation models have limitations: small size, low quality, license issues, lack of reproducibility, privacy concerns. This can lead to poor model performance and inaccurate evaluation.

Proposed Solution   
- Introduce CommitBench, a new large-scale high-quality dataset for commit message generation adopting best practices for creation.

- Apply careful filtering on commit selection and enhancements to improve message quality. Consider privacy, licenses, reproducibility.  

- Compare various existing models on CommitBench and other datasets using standardized evaluation metrics.

Main Contributions
- Compilation of CommitBench dataset with 1.6M commits from 72K projects, extensive filtering and privacy measures applied.

- Unified evaluation of prior approaches on multiple datasets using consistent metrics. Transformer models outperform others.

- Analysis of dataset quality and diversity - CommitBench leads to more diverse model outputs.

- Guidelines and analysis to advance commit message generation research. Public release of dataset/code to enable future work.

In summary, the paper presents a rigorously filtered, large-scale, ethical dataset for advancing commit message generation research, embedded in an analysis of existing approaches using standardized evaluation to determine performance and provide guidelines for future work.
