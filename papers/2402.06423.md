# [CurveFormer++: 3D Lane Detection by Curve Propagation with Temporal   Curve Queries and Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CurveFormer++: 3D Lane Detection by Curve Propagation with Temporal Curve Queries and Attention":

Problem:
- 3D lane detection from monocular cameras is important for autonomous driving systems, but existing methods have limitations:
  - 2D image-based methods require complex post-processing to project lanes to 3D space
  - CNN methods relying on bird's-eye view (BEV) transformation lose vertical lane information 
  - Transformer BEV methods also lose vertical info and rely on dense BEV features

Proposed Solution:
- Propose CurveFormer++, a Transformer-based method for direct 3D lane detection from perspective view images
  - Represents each lane as a sparse curve query with a dynamic ordered anchor point set
  - Employs a Transformer decoder to iteratively refine 3D detection results
  - Introduces a curve cross-attention module to calculate similarities between image features and curve lane queries
  - Uses context sampling and anchor point restrictions for more relevant features
  - Incorporates temporal fusion of selective historical curve queries and anchors 

Main Contributions:
- Formulates 3D lane detection as a curve propagation problem with sparse curve query representation
- Proposes a novel curve cross-attention module for computing query-image similarities
- Introduces dynamic anchor point techniques for robustness  
- Presents a lane-centric temporal fusion method using historical curve queries
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenLane and ONCE-3DLanes datasets, outperforming CNN and Transformer baselines

In summary, this paper tackles limitations of prior work in 3D lane detection by proposing CurveFormer++, a sparse Transformer-based method that leverages curve modeling, cross-attention, and temporal query fusion to effectively perform the task directly from perspective view images.
