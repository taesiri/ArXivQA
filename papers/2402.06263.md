# [ASAP-MPC: An Asynchronous Update Scheme for Online Motion Planning with   Nonlinear Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06263)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Online motion (re-)planning for complex mechatronic systems like drones, mobile robots, and robot manipulators is challenging due to tight constraints on computation time. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a promising technique for motion planning as it can directly incorporate system dynamics and constraints. However, solving the optimal control problem (OCP) underlying NMPC fast enough for real-time embedded applications is difficult, especially with complex nonlinear models, long horizons, and changing environments. Existing methods either simplify the OCP, interrupt the solver early, or reduce the control rate - all of which can lead to suboptimal or infeasible solutions. 

Proposed Solution - ASAP-MPC:
The paper proposes a scheme called ASAP-MPC that allows variable and possibly long computation times for solving the OCP while still providing smooth, feasible, and responsive motion plans. The key ideas are:

1) Combining NMPC feedforward control with fast linear state feedback control for stabilization and tracking. This handles disturbances without relying solely on frequent NMPC updates.

2) Allowing longer but variable solve times for the OCP by using an asynchronous update scheme. The OCP initial state is predicted along the previous trajectory rather than measured, enabling updates at arbitrary times.

3) Smoothly transitioning between consecutive NMPC solutions despite variations in update rate and trajectory computation time. This avoids discontinuous "jumps" in the commanded path.

Main Contributions:

- Explicit handling of computational delays in MPC through novel update scheme

- Natural integration of NMPC and linear control to utilize their complementary advantages 

- Asynchronous updates for responsiveness to environment changes

- Demonstrated applicability for complex nonlinear systems where existing methods fail

The scheme is validated on two challenging applications - navigation of a quadcopter through dynamic obstacles and parking maneuvers of a truck with trailer. Results show feasible, smooth trajectories despite order-of-magnitude variations in computation time. The framework thus enables onboard NMPC motion planning for complex mechatronic systems with limited computation power.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents ASAP-MPC, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme for motion planning that handles varying computation delays through asynchronous updates while guaranteeing feasibility, stability, and performance by integrating MPC trajectory generation with linear feedback control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting ASAP-MPC, an asynchronous update scheme for online motion planning with nonlinear model predictive control. Specifically, ASAP-MPC:

- Explicitly copes with computational delay in MPC by allowing variable and sometimes large solution times, while guaranteeing feasibility and real-time execution. 

- Naturally integrates linear feedback control at a high rate to stabilize the system and track optimized trajectories.

- Smoothly connects subsequent MPC solutions through future on-trajectory updates.

- Rapidly incorporates new environmental information through its asynchronous update scheme, while allowing more time to find a solution at critical points.

The paper shows the functionality of ASAP-MPC through simulation and lab experiments on two significantly different applications - a quadcopter navigating through a cluttered environment and an autonomous truck-trailer system performing parking maneuvers. The results demonstrate ASAP-MPC's applicability to complex nonlinear systems where a state-of-the-art method fails. Overall, ASAP-MPC facilitates the combination of optimal control for planning with classical control for tracking on embedded systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The ASAP-MPC method allows for variable computational times when solving the optimal control problem online. What are the key advantages of this approach compared to methods that require a fixed sampling rate like classical MPC?

2. How does ASAP-MPC address the trajectory jumping phenomenon that can occur when naively adding tighter linear feedback control to MPC? What is the key insight that enables smooth trajectory transitions?

3. What modifications were made to the formulation of the optimal control problem for the truck-trailer system to allow the Real-Time Iteration scheme to be applied? Why was this necessary? 

4. The paper argues that ASAP-MPC eliminates drift that occurs in approaches like the Low Update Rate MPC scheme. What specifically about the way ASAP-MPC samples trajectory points enables this?

5. What are some of the key trade-offs in selecting the prediction horizon parameter m for ASAP-MPC? How might factors like system dynamics and environment complexity impact the choice of m?

6. Could the stitching approach used in ASAP-MPC lead to feasibility issues since the initial condition of each MPC problem is an estimate? How can constraints be adjusted to account for this?

7. What modifications could be made to ASAP-MPC to provide formal guarantees on stability and feasibility? What challenges exist in providing such guarantees?  

8. How suitable is ASAP-MPC for applications that require very precise trajectory tracking beyond what is demonstrated in the experiments here? What enhancements may help address tighter tracking requirements?

9. The computation times for the drone application vary substantially as shown in Fig. 8. What accounts for this variability and how problematic is it for performance of ASAP-MPC?

10. Could approaches like Reinforcement Learning help automate selection of parameters like prediction horizon in ASAP-MPC? What challenges exist in using RL for such hyperparameter optimization in MPC?
