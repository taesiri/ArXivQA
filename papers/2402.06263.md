# [ASAP-MPC: An Asynchronous Update Scheme for Online Motion Planning with   Nonlinear Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06263)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Online motion (re-)planning for complex mechatronic systems like drones, mobile robots, and robot manipulators is challenging due to tight constraints on computation time. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a promising technique for motion planning as it can directly incorporate system dynamics and constraints. However, solving the optimal control problem (OCP) underlying NMPC fast enough for real-time embedded applications is difficult, especially with complex nonlinear models, long horizons, and changing environments. Existing methods either simplify the OCP, interrupt the solver early, or reduce the control rate - all of which can lead to suboptimal or infeasible solutions. 

Proposed Solution - ASAP-MPC:
The paper proposes a scheme called ASAP-MPC that allows variable and possibly long computation times for solving the OCP while still providing smooth, feasible, and responsive motion plans. The key ideas are:

1) Combining NMPC feedforward control with fast linear state feedback control for stabilization and tracking. This handles disturbances without relying solely on frequent NMPC updates.

2) Allowing longer but variable solve times for the OCP by using an asynchronous update scheme. The OCP initial state is predicted along the previous trajectory rather than measured, enabling updates at arbitrary times.

3) Smoothly transitioning between consecutive NMPC solutions despite variations in update rate and trajectory computation time. This avoids discontinuous "jumps" in the commanded path.

Main Contributions:

- Explicit handling of computational delays in MPC through novel update scheme

- Natural integration of NMPC and linear control to utilize their complementary advantages 

- Asynchronous updates for responsiveness to environment changes

- Demonstrated applicability for complex nonlinear systems where existing methods fail

The scheme is validated on two challenging applications - navigation of a quadcopter through dynamic obstacles and parking maneuvers of a truck with trailer. Results show feasible, smooth trajectories despite order-of-magnitude variations in computation time. The framework thus enables onboard NMPC motion planning for complex mechatronic systems with limited computation power.
