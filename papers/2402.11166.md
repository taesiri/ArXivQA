# [GenDec: A robust generative Question-decomposition method for Multi-hop   reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires iterative reasoning across multiple documents to answer complex questions. 
- While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show promise on MHQA, their reasoning process and chains are not well understood.
- Existing question decomposition (QD) methods for MHQA suffer from error propagation between dependent sub-questions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GenDec, a generative QD method to produce independent and complete sub-questions. 
- GenDec leverages retrieved paragraphs to generate natural sub-questions that don't require ordered answering.
- Two modules are proposed - Sub-question enhanced Paragraph Retrieval (SPR) and Sub-question enhanced QA (SQA).

Key Contributions:
- GenDec outperforms prior QD-based and graph neural network QA models on several MHQA datasets.
- Adding GenDec substantially improves the reasoning chains and QA performance of LLMs like GPT-3/4 on MHQA.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of GenDec sub-questions on improving paragraph retrieval and answering in SQA.
- Analysis shows GenDec can produce higher quality and more robust sub-questions compared to prior QD techniques.

In summary, the key innovation is a generative QD approach to produce independent sub-questions that can enhance reasoning for both finetuned QA models and large language models. The paper demonstrates improved MHQA performance and reasoning chains across several experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes GenDec, a generative question decomposition method that generates independent and complete sub-questions to enhance reasoning abilities of QA systems and large language models in multi-hop question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of GenDec, an innovative and robust approach that adeptly generates natural language sub-questions leveraging retrieved paragraphs. This conceals the underlying reasoning chains and facilitates a more intuitive and efficient process for question decomposition.

2) Through rigorous experimentation, the paper demonstrates that GenDec's integration of generated sub-questions into paragraph retrieval and QA modules surpasses the performance of existing QD-based QA models. It also establishes new benchmarks when compared to other formidable baselines.

3) The analysis extends to the synergistic combination of GenDec with LLMs, revealing the pivotal role of QD in augmenting the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing GenDec, a generative question decomposition method, and showing that it improves performance on question answering and paragraph retrieval tasks, as well as enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models.
