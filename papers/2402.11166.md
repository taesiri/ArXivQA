# [GenDec: A robust generative Question-decomposition method for Multi-hop   reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires iterative reasoning across multiple documents to answer complex questions. 
- While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show promise on MHQA, their reasoning process and chains are not well understood.
- Existing question decomposition (QD) methods for MHQA suffer from error propagation between dependent sub-questions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GenDec, a generative QD method to produce independent and complete sub-questions. 
- GenDec leverages retrieved paragraphs to generate natural sub-questions that don't require ordered answering.
- Two modules are proposed - Sub-question enhanced Paragraph Retrieval (SPR) and Sub-question enhanced QA (SQA).

Key Contributions:
- GenDec outperforms prior QD-based and graph neural network QA models on several MHQA datasets.
- Adding GenDec substantially improves the reasoning chains and QA performance of LLMs like GPT-3/4 on MHQA.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of GenDec sub-questions on improving paragraph retrieval and answering in SQA.
- Analysis shows GenDec can produce higher quality and more robust sub-questions compared to prior QD techniques.

In summary, the key innovation is a generative QD approach to produce independent sub-questions that can enhance reasoning for both finetuned QA models and large language models. The paper demonstrates improved MHQA performance and reasoning chains across several experiments.
