# [An Intermediate Fusion ViT Enables Efficient Text-Image Alignment in   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16530)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models have shown promise for conditional text-to-image generation, but still struggle with aligning high-level visual concepts (e.g. object count, relationships) described in the text input. 
- Existing models typically use an "early fusion" approach where frozen CLIP text embeddings are concatenated to image features at the input. This inherits CLIP's limitations and causes interference between mismatched text and image representations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose an "intermediate fusion" approach that adds dedicated trainable text transformer blocks and fuses text embeddings in the middle of the image diffusion backbone (U-ViT).  
- This is based on the insight that high-level semantics are encoded in intermediate layers, while early/late layers focus more on spatial/details. Fusing text guidance later forces better alignment with high-level concepts.

Contributions:
- Systematically compare early vs intermediate fusion with concatenation and cross-attention conditioning methods.
- Intermediate fusion improves text alignment (higher CLIP score) and image quality (lower FID) over early fusion baselines.
- Additional text transformers help further boost CLIP score. Fusing text deeper helps FID. Combined effect beats all metrics.
- Attention map analysis shows early/late text guidance is less focused. Intermediate fusion enhances efficiency and reduces interference.
- Human evaluation confirms improved text alignment (object counting) and preference for image quality.
- Overall, a simple but effective architecture modification that improves conditioning in diffusion models both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In summary, the paper demonstrates how a carefully designed intermediate fusion approach can enable better conditioning and efficiency compared to the commonly used early fusion technique in text-to-image diffusion models. Both automated metrics and human assessment confirm the benefits.
