# [Generative Modeling of Discrete Joint Distributions by E-Geodesic Flow   Matching on Assignment Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating complex discrete/categorical distributions is challenging for existing generative models like normalizing flows or diffusion models. These struggle with representing dependencies between discrete variables or require inefficient training procedures.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a novel normalizing flow model on the "assignment manifold" - the space of factorized discrete distributions. 
- Match the flow of expected geodesics ("e-geodesics") on this manifold, which connects factorized distributions to represent a complex target discrete distribution as their average.
- This enables efficient and stable training via flow matching on the manifold geometry.

Key Contributions:
- New continuous normalizing flow model to represent discrete joint distributions.
- Leverage the geometry of the assignment manifold and information geometry for principled modelling.  
- Stable and efficient training by matching flows of e-geodesics on this manifold.
- Show that complex discrete distributions can be approximated by convex combinations of simple factorized distributions on the manifold.
- Demonstrate broad applicability - model segmentation maps and multi-modal multi-variate discrete distributions.

Main Benefits:
- Avoids issues with likelihood-based training of normalizing flows.
- More efficient than diffusion models or earlier discrete flow methods.
- Represents complex dependencies between many discrete variables.
- Provides a seamless combination of normalizing flows, Riemannian geometry and modelling of discrete distributions.
