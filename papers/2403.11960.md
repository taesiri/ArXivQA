# [CASPER: Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for   Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spatiotemporal time series data collected from sensors often contains missing values due to sensor failures. Imputing these missing values is important for analyzing the data. 
- Existing methods for spatiotemporal imputation try to exploit all available information to impute the missing values but do not distinguish between causal and non-causal relationships in the data. This makes them susceptible to overfitting on spurious correlations introduced by confounders in the data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a causal perspective on spatiotemporal imputation using structural causal models. The model shows confounders introduce backdoor paths between input and output that lead to spurious correlations.
- To eliminate the effect of confounders, the paper leverages a technique called frontdoor adjustment from causality literature. This blocks the backdoor paths by marginalizing out the confounders.  
- Based on frontdoor adjustment, the paper proposes a novel deep learning model called Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CASPER) which has two main components:
   - Prompt-Based Decoder (PBD): Uses prompts to capture contextual information in the data to reduce impact of confounders
   - Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA): Discovers sparse causal relationships between embeddings based on gradient values  

Main Contributions:
- Provides a causal perspective on spatiotemporal imputation task using structural causal models
- Leverages frontdoor adjustment from causality literature to eliminate effect of confounders  
- Proposes a novel model CASPER with prompt-based decoder and causal attention to capture contextual information and sparse causal relationships
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world spatiotemporal imputation datasets while discovering interpretable causal relationships

The key novelty is framing the spatiotemporal imputation problem from a causal lens and using ideas from causality literature to design components of the deep learning model that specifically target eliminating effects of confounders.
