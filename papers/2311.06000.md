# [Keystroke Verification Challenge (KVC): Biometric and Fairness Benchmark   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In keystroke biometrics, there is a lack of standardized databases, protocols, and evaluation metrics, making it difficult to compare different systems and advance research. Most prior work uses small datasets (few hundred subjects).
- Privacy is a concern as keystroke data reveals text content. 
- Fairness across demographic groups has been little explored in keystroke biometrics.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a new experimental framework and challenge (Keystroke Verification Challenge - KVC) for evaluating keystroke verification systems, hosted on CodaLab.
- The framework uses two large public keystroke datasets - Aalto Desktop (168K subjects) and Aalto Mobile (37K subjects). Strict criteria are used to extract evaluation subsets from these datasets.
- The framework defines tasks, protocols, and a comprehensive set of metrics evaluating verification accuracy, fairness, bias, etc.
- Two state-of-the-art systems are evaluated - TypeNet (LSTM) and TypeFormer (Transformer). Four input feature sets are explored, including removing ASCII codes for privacy.
- A new metric called Skewed Impostor Ratio (SIR) is proposed to quantify bias patterns between intra- and inter-group score comparisons.

Main Contributions:
- A much needed standardized evaluation framework and challenge for keystroke verification with large-scale datasets.
- Analysis of deep learning systems on the datasets, suggesting superiority of TypeNet on desktops and TypeFormer on mobiles. 
- Demonstration that removing ASCII codes for privacy does not necessarily reduce accuracy.
- New SIR metric that gives insights into attribute bias, showing the framework's usefulness for studying fairness.
- The framework and challenge allows the community to develop and benchmark improved keystroke verification and fairness techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new experimental framework and challenge for benchmarking keystroke dynamics-based biometric verification systems using large databases, multiple metrics, and state-of-the-art deep learning models to advance research in this field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a new experimental framework and challenge (Keystroke Verification Challenge - KVC) to benchmark keystroke dynamics for biometric verification. This aims to address issues with existing evaluation methodologies like heterogeneity of protocols, limited database sizes, etc.

2. The framework is based on two large-scale public keystroke databases with over 185,000 subjects in total, acquired in desktop and mobile scenarios. It enables assessment of both verification performance as well as fairness metrics.

3. A new fairness metric called Skewed Impostor Ratio (SIR) is introduced to capture intra- and inter-group bias patterns in the verification scores. 

4. The framework is demonstrated using two state-of-the-art systems - TypeNet and TypeFormer. Different input feature sets are evaluated towards more privacy-preserving systems by discarding text content features. Results show acceptable performance is maintained in the desktop case and improved for mobile devices.

5. Comparative analysis of the two systems shows TypeNet works better for desktop while TypeFormer is superior for mobile scenarios. Removing spatial ASCII code information in favor of temporal features is shown to be a feasible approach for privacy enhancement.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of an experimental framework and challenge to standardize evaluation of keystroke biometric systems, enable comparisons, and push forward innovations in this area.
