# [Embers of Autoregression: Understanding Large Language Models Through   the Problem They are Trained to Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we gain a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4? The authors argue that in order to develop such an understanding, we need to consider the problem that these models were trained to solve - next-word prediction over internet text. By recognizing the pressures and constraints exerted by this training objective, we can make informed predictions about the strategies LLMs will adopt and reason about when they will succeed or fail at different tasks. To test their hypotheses, the authors evaluate LLMs on a range of tasks designed to push the models into low-probability situations where errors are likely. Their key findings are:1) LLMs struggle on rare tasks compared to frequent tasks, even when task complexity is held constant.2) LLMs are biased towards high-probability outputs, even on deterministic tasks where probability should be irrelevant. 3) LLMs are also somewhat sensitive to input probability, but less so than output probability.Overall, the central hypothesis is that by taking a "teleological approach" grounded in analyzing the training task, we can gain insights into LLMs that may be missed by human-centric evaluations, allowing us to characterize these models on their own terms. The paper aims to demonstrate the usefulness of this perspective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. It argues for using a "teleological approach" to understand large language models (LLMs) - that is, analyzing them based on the problem they were trained to solve (next-word prediction on internet text) rather than just testing them on benchmarks designed for evaluating human abilities. 2. It hypothesizes several ways that the goal of next-word prediction will influence LLM behavior even on tasks that seem very different from next-word prediction. These include sensitivity to task frequency, output probability, and input probability.3. It tests these hypotheses through extensive experiments on 11 different tasks. The experiments provide evidence that LLMs are indeed influenced by the hypothesized factors - for example, they perform much better on common task variants than rare ones, and on high-probability outputs than low-probability outputs, even for deterministic tasks.4. Based on the experimental results, the paper argues we should be careful about using LLMs in situations involving rare tasks or low-probability outputs, since their performance may degrade. It also argues for evaluating LLMs based on the pressures that shaped them rather than treating them as if they are human.5. The paper situates these ideas within a broader "teleological perspective" aimed at understanding intelligent systems based on the problems they evolved or were trained to solve. It relates this perspective to other analysis approaches like rational analysis.In summary, the key contribution is using a teleological perspective to generate testable hypotheses about LLM behavior which are then confirmed through systematic experiments, leading to a better understanding of these models. The paper illustrates the value of this perspective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:To understand what language models are, we must understand what we have trained them to be.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a teleological perspective for understanding large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the training task, distribution, and architecture that shape them. Here are a few ways it compares to other LLM research:- It takes a more holistic approach compared to work that evaluates LLMs on specific benchmarks or capabilities. The goal is to uncover general principles about LLMs rather than assess performance on particular tasks.- It focuses on illuminating the limitations and biases of LLMs based on their training, whereas much work aims to demonstrate their capabilities. The adversarial evaluation strategy identifies failure cases.- It connects model behavior back to the pressures of the autoregressive next-word prediction task, providing an overarching explanation for phenomena. Much work studies LLM properties in isolation. - The perspective aligns with other proposals for taking a training-based view of models, like analyzing how pretrained knowledge influences behavior. But it offers a more unified framework based on the training task.- The view of evaluating systems based on the pressures they face echoes similar teleological perspectives in cognitive science. But it applies the approach specifically to modern LLMs.Overall, this work provides a complementary lens to other LLM research by embracing a task-focused adversarial approach to reveal unifying principles behind model behavior rooted in how LLMs are trained. The conceptual framing and methodology differ from typical benchmarking evaluations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:- Evaluating large language models with a wider range of tasks, including more complex and practical tasks. The authors used relatively simple tasks in their experiments to investigate basic capabilities of LLMs. They suggest it would be useful to extend their analysis to more advanced tasks. - Analyzing large language models trained with other objectives besides next-word prediction, such as instruction tuning. The authors focused their analysis on next-word prediction since that is the primary training objective for most LLMs, but they note it would be informative to also consider other training techniques.- Further comparing LLMs to humans across the dimensions analyzed in the paper. The authors provided some tentative comparisons to humans but suggest direct experimental comparisons on the same stimuli would help further elucidate the similarities and differences.- Developing better calibration techniques to identify when LLMs are likely to struggle on a task. The authors suggest future work on helping LLMs accurately judge the difficulty of queries could allow LLMs to recognize their limitations.- Identifying additional "embers of autoregression" beyond the ones discussed in the paper. The authors propose their analysis could inspire more hypotheses about other ways LLMs are influenced by their training to perform next-word prediction.- Exploring the effectiveness of techniques like advanced prompting and scaling on overcoming the identified limitations of LLMs. The authors suggest it would be useful to test if techniques like chain-of-thought prompting can mitigate some of the effects they observed.In summary, the authors lay out a research agenda focused on better understanding LLMs through the lens of the pressures exerted by their training, including both experiments to further test their hypotheses and techniques to overcome identified weaknesses.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper argues for using a "teleological approach" to understand large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. This means analyzing LLMs based on the goal they were trained to accomplish, which is next-word prediction on Internet text. The authors hypothesize that because of this goal, LLMs will be influenced by the probability of the task, the probability of the input text, and the probability of the target output, even in situations where probability should be irrelevant. To test their hypotheses, they evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on various tasks designed to push the models into low-probability situations, like decoding obscure ciphers or producing random word sequences. They find strong evidence that LLMs struggle more on rare tasks and when the input or output text is improbable. For example, GPT-4's accuracy at decoding a simple cipher drops from 51% to 13% when the output changes from a probable to improbable sentence. The authors conclude that practitioners should be careful using LLMs for low-probability tasks, and more broadly that we should evaluate LLMs based on the pressures that shaped them during training, not as if they were human reasoners. The results reveal fundamental limitations arising from the statistical, next-word prediction nature of LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper argues for using a "teleological approach" to understand large language models (LLMs). This means analyzing LLMs based on the problem they were trained to solve - next-word prediction over internet text. The authors hypothesize that because LLMs were trained for this goal, their behavior will be influenced by factors related to next-word prediction even when doing other tasks. Specifically, they predict LLMs will perform worse on rare vs frequent tasks, on outputs with low vs high probability, and sometimes on inputs with low probability. To test these hypotheses, the authors evaluated two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on a diverse set of 11 tasks designed to push models into low-probability situations. Across tasks like counting, cipher-decoding, and algebra problems, they found strong evidence that both task frequency and output/input probability substantially affect LLM accuracy, even in deterministic settings. The authors conclude that we should evaluate LLMs based on the pressures that shaped them, not as if they were humans. This helps reveal cases where LLMs will struggle, like generating rare text or performing uncommon tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper takes a teleological approach to understanding large language models (LLMs) by considering the problem that LLMs were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. Based on an analysis of this goal, the authors generate hypotheses about factors that will influence LLM performance, such as task probability, output probability, and input probability. They then test these hypotheses through experiments evaluating two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on eleven text manipulation tasks, such as decoding shift ciphers and forming acronyms. The experiments are designed to create situations where models will make some errors, allowing the authors to investigate how varying factors like output probability impacts error rates. Across the experiments, they find evidence supporting their hypotheses, such as LLMs performing better on common task variants than rare ones, even when the variants have equal complexity. The results illustrate how recognizing the pressures that shaped LLMs can aid in understanding their strengths and weaknesses.
