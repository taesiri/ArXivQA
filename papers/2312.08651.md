# [Towards Inductive Robustness: Distilling and Fostering Wave-induced   Resonance in Transductive GCNs Against Graph Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08651)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an inductive and robust graph neural network called the Graph Resonance-fostering Network (GRN). The authors first prove an equivalence between the message passing signals in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and waves propagating on the graph topology, showing GCNs inherently have resonance that provides robustness. They then mathematically define resonance intensity in GCNs and prove that 3-layer GCNs involuntarily induce resonance between nodes and their surrounding structure. This resonance manifests as nodes capturing weighted local subgraphs. Building on these insights, GRN is presented to purposefully foster resonance by learning representations that combine both node features and signals from distilled local resonance subgraphs. This allows GRN to generalize robustness to unseen nodes. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy under graph perturbations while not sacrificing clean graph performance. Theoretical analysis also shows attacking 3-layer GCNs has exponentially higher cost for adversaries. Overall, this work makes key contributions in connecting GCN robustness to resonance and leveraging it to achieve inductive and robust graph learning.
