# [Disentangled Clothed Avatar Generation from Text Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-avatar methods typically generate a single entangled 3D mesh representing the entire avatar, including body, clothes, hair etc. This lacks disentanglement between components, posing challenges for editing and animation.
- Very limited works have explored generating disentangled avatars from text descriptions. Developing such a method is non-trivial as it requires not just separate generation but also seamless alignment of the components.

Proposed Method: 
- The paper proposes a novel disentangled avatar representation called Sequentially Offset SMPL (SO-SMPL) consisting of separate meshes for body and clothes.
- SO-SMPL represents the body using SMPL-X model plus offsets and represents clothes as additional displacements and vertex masks grown on top of the body mesh. This ensures alignment between components.
- A two stage pipeline is designed leveraging score distillation from diffusion models. Stage 1 focuses on generating just the human body mesh while Stage 2 adds clothing conditioned on Stage 1 body.
- Body and clothes both use MLPs to represent textures. A smoothness constraint prevents baked-in artifacts in textures. 

Main Contributions:
- First complete pipeline to generate disentangled and animatable avatars from text descriptions, with separate 3D meshes for body and clothes.
- Introduces SO-SMPL, a new representation for disentangled avatars ensuring alignment between components.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of geometry, texture and animation quality compared to previous text-to-avatar works, enabled by the disentanglement.
- Unlocks improved editing and customization capabilities like easy virtual try-on of outfits, fitting clothes to new bodies etc.

In summary, the paper successfully tackles the challenging problem of generating disentangled avatars from text through a novel two-stage pipeline and representation. The high quality animatable digital humans generated can enable diverse downstream applications.
