# [Reconstructions of Jupiter's magnetic field using physics informed   neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Jupiter's interior structure and magnetic field generation are poorly constrained. Reconstructions of the magnetic field from Juno spacecraft data can help infer the interior, but existing methods using spherical harmonics have limitations. Specifically, downward continuation of the models amplifies noise, obscuring details of the dynamo region. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop novel reconstructions called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that are not limited by inherent instabilities under downward continuation. By weakly imposing physics constraints and allowing local structures, the PINN models provide clearer images of Jupiter's interior magnetic field.

- Two PINN models are created based on the first 33 (PINN33) and 50 (PINN50) Juno orbits. For each, an exterior model representing above Jupiter's surface and interior model extending below the surface are produced. These are compared to recent spherical harmonic models.

Key Results:
- On Jupiter's surface, all models give similar magnetic field structure and data fit. But at depth, the PINN interior models remain smooth and noise-free, revealing localized flux patches not visible in the spherical harmonic models. 

- The magnetic field below 85% of Jupiter's radius appears as longitudinal bands, with oppositely signed flux patches near the Great Blue Spot. The field is confined almost entirely north of the equator.

- Dynamo radius is estimated at 80% of Jupiter's radius for the PINN models, similar to other recent studies. This radius is inferred based on the slope of the Lowes-Mauersberger spectrum flattening toward white noise.

Main Contributions:
- First physics-informed neural network reconstruction of Jupiter's magnetic field, enabled by innovations in training methodology
- Superior downward continuation providing a clearer view of Jupiter's interior not possible with existing spherical harmonic methods
- Estimates of dynamo radius and banded longitudinal magnetic structures at depth

In summary, the paper demonstrates PINN models as a promising new technique for mapping planetary magnetic fields, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and revealing new details on Jupiter's internal dynamo. The approach could be applied to other planets and moons as well.
