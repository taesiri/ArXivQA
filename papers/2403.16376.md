# [Elite360D: Towards Efficient 360 Depth Estimation via Semantic- and   Distance-Aware Bi-Projection Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 360째 depth estimation is important for 3D reconstruction but faces challenges due to spherical distortion in equirectangular projection (ERP) images. 
- Prior methods try to address this using cross-projection fusion with other projections like cubemaps, but have limitations:
  - Limited local receptive fields unable to capture full 360째 context
  - Complex fusion modules increase computational cost

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes Elite360D framework for efficient 360째 depth estimation using bi-projection fusion of ERP images and icosahedron projection (ICOSAP) point sets
- Key Components:
  - Flexible ERP image encoder to leverage off-the-shelf CNN/transformer models pre-trained on perspective images
  - ICOSAP point encoder to extract global features 
  - Bi-Projection Bi-Attention Fusion (B2F) module to capture semantic and spatial dependencies between ERP pixels and ICOSAP points
- B2F has semantic-aware attention to model feature similarities and distance-aware attention for spatial relationships. Output is fused using gated fusion.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces ICOSAP point sets which are spatially continuous and globally perceptive
- B2F module jointly models semantic and spatial dependencies between projections to enable local ERP features to perceive whole scene
- Framework supports diverse off-the-shelf encoder models, improving flexibility over specialized models

The method shows significant performance gains over baseline ERP models and achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal additional parameters, demonstrating an efficient and effective approach to 360째 depth estimation through bi-projection fusion.
