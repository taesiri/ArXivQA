# [MoSECroT: Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual   Zero-shot Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have shown remarkable performance on NLP tasks, but require large amounts of data and compute to pre-train, limiting their availability to only high-resource languages. 
- Static word embeddings are easier to obtain for low-resource languages, but cannot be directly used for downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new task called MoSECroT (Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual Zero-shot Transfer) to leverage:
  - A PLM pre-trained on a source high-resource language
  - Static word embeddings of a low-resource target language
  - Model stitching to align spaces and perform zero-shot transfer

- Use relative representations (RRs) to construct a common space between the source PLM embeddings and target static embeddings.
  - Select parallel lexicon entries as anchors 
  - Build RRs by recording cosine similarity of each token to the anchors
  - Linearly transform RRs back to source PLM embedding dimensionality
  - Fine-tune source PLM and stitch target embeddings for zero-shot evaluation

Main Contributions:
- Formalize the novel and challenging MoSECroT task to enable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low-resource languages
- Propose the first method using RRs for model stitching to align source PLM and target static word embedding spaces
- Evaluation on text classification datasets shows method is competitive to weak baselines, but not strong neural baselines
- Analyze limitations of anchor selection, translation quality, embedding space changes as likely causes 

In summary, the paper introduces the MoSECroT task and an initial solution using RRs for model stitching, demonstrating potential for low-resource language utilization while identifying areas for improvement in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MoSECroT, a new crosslingual transfer task leveraging static word embeddings for low-resource languages, proposes a method using relative representations to enable zero-shot transfer, but finds only modest improvements over baselines, analyzing possible reasons and future improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is summarized as follows:

(i) They introduce MoSECroT, a novel and challenging task for (especially low-resource) languages where static word embeddings are available. 

(ii) They propose a solution that leverages relative representations to construct a common space for source (English in their case) and target languages. This allows for zero-shot transfer to the target languages by training the model on source language data and simply swapping the embedding layer to the target language.

So in summary, the main contributions are:
1) Defining a new task (MoSECroT) for low-resource cross-lingual transfer using static embeddings 
2) A method using relative representations to enable zero-shot transfer between languages by stitching embeddings spaces.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- MoSECroT - The novel task introduced in the paper, which stands for "Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual Zero-shot Transfer"

- Model stitching - The technique of combining components of different neural network models, which is applied in this work to combine a source language BERT model with target language static word embeddings

- Relative representations - Used to transform the embedding spaces of the source and target languages to enable alignment and space mapping between them 

- Zero-shot transfer - The goal of the paper to achieve zero-shot performance on target languages by fine-tuning only on source language data and swapping out the embeddings

- Low-resource languages - A focus of the paper is applying the techniques to enable transfer learning for languages with limited resources, for which static word embeddings may be available

- Embedding mapping - The process of projecting target language embeddings into the source language BERT embedding space to enable space alignment

- Parallel anchors - Bilingual word pairs used to compute relative representations and alignments between languages

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed MoSECroT task, the model stitching and relative representation techniques used, the zero-shot transfer setting, and the application to low-resource languages.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using relative representations (RRs) to construct a common space between the source and target languages. Can you explain in more detail how the RRs are computed and what role the parallel anchors play in this process? 

2. The paper transforms the RRs back to the original embedding dimension. What is the motivation behind this step and how exactly is the transformation achieved using a weighted sum of anchor embeddings?

3. The paper explores three different settings for computing RRs - standard, with softmax, and with sparsemax. What are the key differences between these settings and what impact do they have on the zero-shot performance?

4. The paper selects the top 50 closest anchors when computing the weighted sum to transform RRs. What is the intuition behind using the closest anchors and how was the optimal value of 50 determined? 

5. The anchor selection process relies on bilingual lexica which can be noisy. What are some ways the paper tried to address this issue and why were they not very effective?

6. One of the limitations mentioned is that the embedding space is completely altered after applying RRs. Why do you think this is problematic and how can it be addressed?

7. The paper only evaluates on classification tasks. What other tasks could the method be applied to and what challenges might arise when extending to other tasks?

8. Could this method work in a semi-supervised setting where a small amount of labeled target language data is available? How could the method be adapted for this scenario?

9. The paper compares against mBERT and shows competitive performance on low-resource languages. What are the key advantages of the proposed method over mBERT?

10. The method relies on static word embeddings being available for the target language. For extremely low-resource languages, these may not exist. How can the approach be extended for such scenarios?
