# [SparseViT: Revisiting Activation Sparsity for Efficient High-Resolution   Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17605)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we leverage activation sparsity to improve the efficiency of high-resolution vision transformers, while retaining their accuracy?Specifically, the authors propose a method called SparseViT to revisit activation sparsity in the context of recent window-based vision transformers (ViTs) like Swin Transformer. Their key ideas include:- Performing window-level activation pruning in ViTs to achieve actual speedup, since window attentions are naturally batched over windows.- Using a sparsity-aware adaptation method during training to accommodate the model to activation sparsity.- Employing an evolutionary search algorithm to efficiently explore the best layerwise sparsity configuration under a latency constraint. The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully incorporating activation sparsity into ViTs in this manner, it is possible to reduce computation and improve efficiency for high-resolution image recognition tasks, while maintaining the models' accuracy. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on monocular 3D object detection, 2D instance segmentation, and 2D semantic segmentation.In summary, the central research question is about improving efficiency of vision transformers via activation sparsity, and the key hypothesis is that this can be done without sacrificing accuracy by using the SparseViT method proposed in the paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing SparseViT, a method to leverage activation sparsity for efficient high-resolution vision transformers. The key ideas are:- Revisiting activation sparsity in the context of recent window-based vision transformers (ViTs) like Swin Transformer. Unlike CNNs, window attention is naturally batched, so window-level activation pruning can achieve actual speedup.- Introducing sparsity-aware adaptation during training, which randomly samples different layerwise sparsity configurations. This adapts the model to sparsity without expensive retraining. - Using evolutionary search to efficiently explore the vast search space and find the optimal per-layer sparsity ratios under latency constraints.- Achieving 1.5x, 1.4x and 1.3x speedup on monocular 3D detection, 2D instance segmentation and 2D semantic segmentation respectively, with negligible to no accuracy drop.In summary, the paper shows that activation sparsity can be effectively leveraged to accelerate high-resolution ViTs, by designing techniques like sparsity-aware adaptation and evolutionary search to find optimal layerwise configurations. This allows preserving high-resolution details efficiently.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes SparseViT, a vision transformer model that uses evolutionary search to determine optimal per-layer activation sparsity ratios and adapts the model to sparsity during training, achieving speedups of 1.5x, 1.4x, and 1.3x on monocular 3D object detection, 2D instance segmentation, and 2D semantic segmentation tasks compared to the dense baseline with minimal loss of accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:- This paper focuses specifically on using activation sparsity to improve the efficiency of vision transformers (ViTs). Most prior work on sparsity has focused more on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Applying sparsity to ViTs is still relatively underexplored.- The authors demonstrate measurable speedups from activation sparsity in ViTs (1.3-1.5x) on real hardware, whereas most prior activation sparsity papers only show theoretical speedups. This is a useful practical contribution.- The proposed SparseViT method uses simple L2 normalization based scoring of window importance rather than more complex learned scoring. The results show this simple scoring works well, while being lower overhead.- The paper introduces sparsity-aware adaptation during training to get a better proxy of a model's accuracy with sparsity before costly retraining. This is a useful technique for efficiently exploring sparsity. - An evolutionary search method is proposed to identify good per-layer sparsity ratios based on accuracy and hardware latency constraints. Many prior works use predefined or manually tuned sparsity ratios.- Experiments across multiple vision tasks (3D detection, 2D detection, segmentation) demonstrate the general applicability of their approach.Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in effectively applying and optimizing activation sparsity specifically for vision transformers. The techniques introduced like sparsity-aware adaptation and evolutionary search could also inspire future work on sparsity.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring activation pruning for other vision transformer architectures beyond Swin Transformer. The authors specifically suggest trying it on MLP-based ViTs like gMLP and ResMLP.- Applying activation pruning to other modalities beyond vision, like text and speech transformers. The authors suggest it could be particularly promising for speech recognition models that take high-resolution spectrograms as input.- Developing specialized hardware accelerators that can take advantage of activation sparsity to achieve even higher speedups. The paper mentions this could be an interesting direction.- Exploring different strategies for scoring window importance beyond just L2 magnitude used in this work. The authors suggest future work could investigate more advanced learned scoring functions.- Extending the ideas to video transformers. The paper proposes that skipping computations on less informative frames via activation pruning could be promising.- Trying different layerwise sparsity search algorithms beyond the evolutionary approach used in this work. The authors suggest this could be an interesting area for future work.- Investigating whether activation pruning can enable training higher-resolution vision transformers that would otherwise not fit in memory, by reducing activations.In summary, the main future directions are exploring activation pruning in other model architectures, modalities, and hardware, using more advanced scoring functions, and applying the ideas to video transformers. The authors position this work as an initial foray into activation pruning for vision transformers that opens up many exciting avenues for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces SparseViT, a vision transformer that leverages activation sparsity for efficient high-resolution vision tasks. It revisits activation pruning in the context of recent window-based vision transformers (ViTs). Different from CNNs where sparsity does not lead to speedup, window attentions in ViTs are naturally batched, making real speedup possible with window-level activation pruning. The paper proposes sparsity-aware adaptation and evolutionary search to efficiently find the optimal per-layer sparsity configuration. Experiments on monocular 3D detection, 2D instance segmentation, and 2D semantic segmentation show that SparseViT achieves 1.5x-1.3x speedup over the dense baseline with negligible accuracy drop. The key insight is that pruning activations is more effective than input downsampling for retaining high-resolution details critical for vision tasks. Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of leveraging activation sparsity in ViTs to improve efficiency.
