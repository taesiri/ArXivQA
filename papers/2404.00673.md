# [A Survey of Privacy-Preserving Model Explanations: Privacy Risks,   Attacks, and Countermeasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00673)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on privacy attacks targeting machine learning model explanations and their countermeasures. As the adoption of explainable AI (XAI) grows, so does the need to address privacy implications. Despite increasing research on AI privacy and explainability, there has been little focus specifically on privacy risks of model explanations. 

The paper provides a thorough analysis of over 50 research papers on privacy attacks and defenses related to model explanations. A key contribution is the connected taxonomy organizing existing literature based on the types of explanations attacked and the methodologies used in attacks and defenses.

The survey examines common attacks like membership inference, reconstruction, attribute inference, and model extraction, describing their threat models, attack scenarios, and impact on various explanation types including feature-based, surrogate models, example-based, and counterfactuals. It also covers emerging research into the root causes of privacy leaks in explanations due to inherent vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the paper explores countermeasures to safeguard privacy with mechanisms like differential privacy, anonymization, perturbations, and collaborative explanation. It introduces the concept of privacy-preserving explanations designed to inherently protect user data. The challenges around balancing explanation utility and privacy preservation are discussed.

Other notable contributions include an aggregation of datasets, metrics, algorithms, and models frequently utilized in this domain to aid further research. The survey concludes by highlighting unresolved issues and suggesting promising research directions in both offensive and defensive aspects related to privacy in XAI systems. An online repository with pertinent literature is also established for the community.

Overall, this is the first holistic examination of the interplay between transparency via model explanations and privacy considerations, offering valuable organization and perspective to drive progress in this critical area of machine learning.
