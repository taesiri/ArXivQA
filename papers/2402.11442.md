# [Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and   Improving LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive reasoning abilities, but their mastery of underlying logical rules and inferences still falls short of human capabilities. 
- Manually crafted rules often appear too simple to generalize, while existing methods for generating logical rules have limitations in diversity and accuracy.
- There is a need for a framework to systematically generate a wide variety of accurate and complex logical rules to rigorously test LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a logic scaffolding framework called LOIRE to automatically generate a large set of inferential rules with different complexities.
- It has two stages - generating simple "primitive" rules using GPT-4, and then composing them into more complex rules using backward chaining. This ensures accuracy and diversity.
- Using this, they construct a dataset called ULogic with ~8K primitive and ~6K compositional rules spanning 5 reasoning domains.

Analyses and Contributions:
- Use ULogic rules to systematically test reasoning capabilities of LLMs including GPT-4. Show significant gaps compared to humans, especially for complex rules.
- Distill rules into a smaller inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing reasoning tasks. Engine outperforms GPT-3.5 in generating more complex and abstract rules.
- Overall, proposed logic scaffolding framework generates challenging rule dataset; analysis uncovers limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning; distilled engine effectively improves reasoning.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective framework to generate logical rules for testing and enhancing reasoning skills of large language models to match complex human capabilities. The analysis and inference engine address limitations of current LLMs.
