# [StableToolBench: Towards Stable Large-Scale Benchmarking on Tool   Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "StableToolBench: Towards Stable Large-Scale Benchmarking on Tool Learning of Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Existing tool learning benchmarks rely on either small-scale handcrafted tools or large-scale unstable real online APIs. The instability of real APIs leads to irreproducible and incomparable benchmark results over time.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce StableToolBench, a new benchmark with two main components:
  1) Virtual API Server: Contains a caching system to store API call responses and API simulators using LLMs to simulate unavailable real APIs. This ensures APIs are always accessible.
  2) Stable Evaluation System: Judges solvable tasks and uses metrics like Solvable Pass Rate (SoPR) with GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator to reduce randomness.

Main Contributions:
- Significantly enhances stability of model performance evaluation despite API failures. Experiments show consistent scores even with 50% API failure rate.
- Virtual API system maintains diversity and realism comparable to real APIs based on human evaluation and embedding visualization. 
- Caching system greatly contributes to stability with over 90% cache hit rate for in-domain methods.
- Replacing GPT-3.5 evaluator with GPT-4 yields over 70% accuracy, much higher than GPT-3.5's sub-70% accuracy.

In summary, StableToolBench enables reliable assessment of models' tool usage abilities over time through its stable virtual API server and evaluation system. The benchmark demonstrates enhanced reproducibility and comparability while maintaining diversity and scope.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called StableToolBench that enhances the stability of the ToolBench benchmark for evaluating tool usage capabilities of language models by implementing a caching system and simulated API server to ensure consistent data availability, as well as designing new evaluation metrics and using stronger automatic evaluators to reduce randomness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing StableToolBench, a new tool learning benchmark that enhances the stability of the ToolBench benchmark. Specifically, the paper:

1) Implements a caching system and virtual API server using LLMs to simulate API behavior in order to ensure consistent API availability and responses over time. This addresses the issue of unstable real-world APIs in previous benchmarks like ToolBench.

2) Designs a stable evaluation system including new metrics (SoPR and SoWR) and using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator. This aims to reduce randomness and improve reliability in assessing model performance on tool usage. 

3) Demonstrates through experiments that StableToolBench significantly enhances stability while maintaining diversity and realism compared to using real unstable APIs. The caching system and API simulators are shown to be effective. The evaluation system also exhibits higher correlation with human judgment.

In summary, StableToolBench makes key innovations in constructing a reliable and reproducible benchmark for evaluating progress on tool learning, addressing limitations around stability in prior benchmarks.
