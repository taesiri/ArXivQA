# [Careless Whisper: Speech-to-Text Hallucination Harms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper evaluates the accuracy of OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text API, a state-of-the-art commercial service. 
- They find troubling issues where Whisper sometimes hallucinates content, generating entire phrases or sentences that do not exist at all in the input audio. Around 1% of transcriptions contain such hallucinations.
- The authors analyze these hallucinations and find 38% contain concerning or harmful content like violence, made up personal details, or false claims of authority. This poses risks of misrepresentation, misinterpretation or even threats to readers.

Proposed Solution / Contributions:
- The authors conduct what they call the first large-scale external evaluation of Whisper on over 13,000 audio samples, comparing transcriptions to ground truth transcripts.
- They identify and categorize different types of potentially harmful hallucinated content generated by Whisper.
- They hypothesize two underlying causes - overreliance on generative language models and vulnerability to disfluencies which disproportionately impact speakers with conditions like aphasia.  
- Indeed, they find higher rates of hallucinations for aphasic speakers (1.7%) versus control groups (1.2%), indicating speech bias issues.
- Based on the analysis, the authors provide specific calls to action for OpenAI and the broader speech recognition community to study, understand and address the causes of problematic hallucinations in systems like Whisper.

In summary, the key contributions are surfacing previously unknown issues with potential harms from hallucinations in Whisper, providing both analysis of the types of hallucinations and hypotheses on underlying causes, demonstrating disproportionate speech biases, and laying out concrete next steps to ameliorate the issues.
