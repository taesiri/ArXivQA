# [Dendrogram distance: an evaluation metric for generative networks using   hierarchical clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16894)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel metric called Dendrogram Distance (DD) to evaluate generative models, with a focus on detecting mode collapse. The method represents the real and generated data through dendrograms obtained via hierarchical clustering. It then measures the divergence between the two dendrograms by comparing their sorted agglomerative distances, which corresponds to an ultrametric space. Experiments show DD is more robust in capturing the number of modes compared to FID when evaluating 2D synthetic datasets, even when the relative positions of modes are perturbed. DD also demonstrates an ability to detect mode collapse and monitor convergence when applied directly to MNIST image pixels. When extracting features from pre-trained CNNs, DD exhibits competitive performance against FID and Inception Score in detecting mode drop on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and CelebA datasets. Theoretical guarantees from clustering literature and interpretability are advantages of DD. Overall, DD shows promise as an evaluation metric complementary to existing methods, with sensitivity to mode collapse and theoretical foundations. Future work includes refining DD for unstructured data and investigating its use directly during model training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel generative model evaluation metric called Dendrogram Distance that uses hierarchical clustering of real and generated data to quantify divergence between their distributions and detect issues like mode collapse.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of the Dendrogram Distance (DD), a novel evaluation metric for generative models that relies on hierarchical clustering to evaluate the generated data. Specifically:

- The DD uses dendrograms to represent real and fake/generated data, allowing for the divergence between training and generated samples to be computed. This allows it to focus on detecting mode collapse in generators.

- The DD is shown through experiments to be more sensitive in detecting differences in the number of modes covered by a generator compared to other metrics like FID. It is also more robust to position perturbations of the modes.

- The DD provides a quantitative measure to augment the commonly used 2D benchmark datasets for evaluating generative models.

- Experiments show the DD can work with image data by using embeddings, and it is competitive with FID and IS for detecting mode collapse.

In summary, the key contribution is a new evaluation metric that allows better assessment of mode collapse in generative models, with theoretical grounding and demonstrated experimental results. The interpretability of dendrograms and linkage to clustering are also useful aspects of the approach.

The paper proposes a new evaluation metric called Dendrogram Distance (DD) for generative models, especially GANs. It uses dendrograms and hierarchical clustering to measure the difference between real and generated data distributions. A key focus is detecting mode collapse in the generated samples. Experiments show DD is more robust in 2D synthetic datasets compared to FID and also works reasonably well for image data by using embeddings. The interpretability of dendrograms is also emphasized as an advantage.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using dendrograms constructed from the real and generated data distributions to evaluate generative models. Why are dendrograms a good representation for this task compared to simpler statistics like mean and covariance? 

2. The equivalence between dendrograms and ultrametric spaces is utilized in the paper. Explain this equivalence and why it allows the use of methods from metric space literature to analyze dendrograms.

3. The paper claims the proposed Dendrogram Distance (DD) metric is able to reliably detect the presence of mode collapse. Explain why this is the case and why metrics like FID may fail at this.

4. The experiments show DD has lower variance than FID when mode positions are perturbed in 2D datasets. Why does DD demonstrate better stability?

5. For image data, the paper extracts features using a CNN before constructing dendrograms. Why is using a feature representation better than applying DD directly to pixels for images?

6. The paper shows DD can act as a proxy for convergence during GAN training. Why is analyzing convergence difficult for GANs and how can DD help assess this? 

7. On STL-10, DD performed worse at distinguishing modes compared to FID and IS. What are some possible reasons for this and how could DD be improved?

8. The paper claims DD relies on formation of clusters in the feature space. How could the embeddings/feature extraction be improved to produce better clusters?

9. The paper suggests using DD as a training objective instead of just an evaluation metric. What benefits could this provide? How would the training process differ?

10. The paper focuses on mode collapse detection but mentions DD could be used to compare datasets generally. What modifications would be needed to assess similarity of arbitrary datasets with DD?
