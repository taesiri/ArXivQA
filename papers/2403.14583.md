# [Co-Optimization of Environment and Policies for Decentralized   Multi-Agent Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper studies the problem of decentralized multi-agent navigation in cluttered environments. It considers a multi-agent system consisting of multiple mobile agents navigating towards destinations in an environment with obstacles. 

The key idea is that the agents and their environment should be viewed as a co-evolving system, where the behavior of one affects and depends on the other. As such, the paper proposes to simultaneously optimize both the navigation policy of the agents as well as the configuration of the environment itself to maximize the navigation performance. 

Specifically, two sub-problems are identified: (1) multi-agent navigation, which seeks to find an optimal decentralized policy to guide agents to their destinations while avoiding collisions, and (2) environment optimization, which seeks to find an optimal configuration of obstacles in the environment to facilitate agent navigation.

To solve this joint optimization problem, the paper develops a coordinated optimization algorithm that alternates between optimizing a navigation policy parameterized by a graph neural network (GNN) using reinforcement learning, and optimizing an environment generative model parameterized by a deep neural network (DNN) using policy gradient ascent.

By coordinating these two model-free learning processes, the algorithm establishes a symbiotic co-evolution between agents and environment, where they rely on and adapt to each other to improve navigation performance.

Theoretical analysis is provided showing that this coordinated optimization scheme converges to the local minimum trajectory of an associated non-convex optimization problem.

Experiments demonstrate the benefit of co-optimization over standard baselines, with performance improvements especially significant as environment complexity increases. An interesting finding is that optimized environments can positively guide agents through targeted spatial deconfliction. This is unlike existing views of environments mainly providing negative restrictions.

In summary, the key contributions are: (i) the concept of agent-environment co-optimization, (ii) a coordinated optimization algorithm combining reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning in an alternating manner, (iii) theoretical convergence guarantees, and (iv) experimental validation showing both performance improvements and novel environment guidance roles from co-optimization.
