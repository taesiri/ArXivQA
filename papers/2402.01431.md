# [Approximate Control for Continuous-Time POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of decision-making and control for partially observable systems that evolve continuously in time, have discrete state spaces, and discrete action spaces. Such systems arise in many real-world applications like queueing networks, biological systems, etc. However, computing optimal policies for such systems is very challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. More specifically, exactly solving the Bayesian filtering problem to compute the belief state and using it to solve the stochastic optimal control problem becomes intractable for large state spaces.

Proposed Solution  
The paper proposes a two-pronged approach to tackle the scalability issues:

1. Approximate the intractable Bayesian filtering distribution using a parametric distribution based on the entropic matching method. This results in simple ODEs for evolving the parameters of the distribution over time. Closed-form solutions for the ODEs are provided for queueing networks and chemical reaction networks.

2. Use a heuristic based on the underlying fully observable MDP to compute an approximate optimal policy. Specifically, first compute the Q-function for the fully observable MDP using function approximation. Then compute an approximate policy by taking expectations of this Q-function under the approximate filtering distribution from step 1 above.

Main Contributions
- Formalizes the problem of control for continuous-time POMDPs with discrete state and action spaces
- Proposes a scalable approach that combines approximate Bayesian filtering with a heuristic policy computation method
- Derives closed-form entropic matching solutions for queueing networks and chemical reaction networks  
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on queueing networks, predator-prey systems, and biological reaction networks

The key novelty is in proposing the first known scalable solution approach for this class of challenging partially observable control problems with discrete states and actions in continuous time.
