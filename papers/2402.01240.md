# [Beyond the Request: Harnessing HTTP Response Headers for Cross-Browser   Web Tracker Classification in an Imbalanced Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Web tracking is prevalent and raises privacy concerns, but filter lists used to block trackers have limitations like manual curation and vulnerability to circumvention.  
- Past research has explored using ML for web tracker detection, but most focus only on HTTP requests while neglecting HTTP responses. Also, most rely only on Firefox data, limiting diversity.
- There is a gap regarding using HTTP responses as the sole data source for cross-browser web tracker classification, especially in imbalanced data settings.

Proposed Solution:
- Collect HTTP response data from Chrome, Firefox and Brave using the T.EX browser extension on Tranco top 10K websites.
- Preprocess data via filtering, fuzzy matching of headers, and binary encoding. Retain class imbalance.  
- Train 11 supervised classifiers (tree and gradient boosting ensembles) on Chrome data. Test on all browsers.
- Evaluate with 13 metrics including Accuracy, F1-Score, AUPRC, calibrated probabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of HTTP response similarities and differences across browsers regarding web tracking.
- High-performing tree and gradient boosting classifiers using binary encoded HTTP responses, achieving Accuracy and F1 >0.9.  
- Rigorous cross-browser testing shows strong Chrome and Firefox performance but limitations generalizing to distinct Brave distribution.
- Longitudinal testing indicates minor degradation over time. Calibration has little effect.
- First study demonstrating viability of HTTP response headers alone for ML-based web tracker detection across diverse browsers in imbalanced setting.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed data-driven machine learning solution, evaluation approach, main results and contributions, providing a detailed understanding of this research.
