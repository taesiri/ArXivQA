# [One model to use them all: Training a segmentation model with   complementary datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19340)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic segmentation of surgical scenes is important for computer-assisted surgery systems to provide intelligent assistance. 
- Training high-quality segmentation models requires large datasets with pixel-level annotations for all relevant classes. Such datasets are difficult and time-consuming to obtain.
- Existing datasets provide only partial annotations, with different datasets labeling different classes.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a method to combine multiple complementary datasets with partial annotations into one model to enable full scene segmentation. 
- Leverage mutual exclusive property of classes to maximize information from each dataset. Positively labeled pixels for one class are used as negative samples for other classes.
- Pixels with unknown labels are excluded from loss calculation rather than assigning them to background.

Methods:
- Use DeepLabV3 with ResNet50 backbone initialized with COCO pretraining.
- Train with AdamW optimizer and cross entropy loss. Mask loss to ignore unknown label pixels.  
- Evaluate segmentation performance using mean Dice coefficient over all classes.

Experiments:
- Use public Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset with 11 anatomical structure classes and 13,195 laparoscopic images.
- Compare to ensemble model baseline and fully supervised upper bound.
- Proposed approach combines 6 classes, improving Dice by 4.4% over ensemble and reducing confusion between organs.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of training multi-class organ segmentation from multiple complementary datasets.
- Shows models benefit from improved scene understanding and confusion reduction from knowing more classes.
- Overcomes data bottleneck in surgical data science without needing fully annotated dataset.
- Enables real-time 43 fps inference while allowing additional classes to be added without increase in computation.

In summary, the paper presents a method to combine multiple surgical datasets to train better segmentation models, while requiring less exhaustive annotation effort. This helps address the data availability bottleneck in the field.
