# [Out-of-Candidate Rectification for Weakly Supervised Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to rectify out-of-candidate (OC) error predictions in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. The key hypothesis is that OC errors, where the predicted class contradicts the image-level labels, can be reduced by pushing OC pixels away from OC class centers and pulling them closer to in-candidate (IC) class centers.

The main contributions are:

- Identifying OC errors as a major problem in weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. These are pixels wrongly predicted as classes not present in the image-level labels.

- Proposing an Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) method to reduce OC errors by adaptively splitting classes into IC and OC groups and using a rectification loss to push OC pixels away from OC classes and towards IC classes.

- Showing consistent improvements in OC error rates and segmentation performance when applying OCR to multiple baselines on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. This demonstrates its effectiveness and generality.

So in summary, the paper focuses on the problem of OC errors in weakly supervised segmentation and proposes the OCR approach to reduce them by framing it as a group ranking problem and deriving a custom rectification loss. The central hypothesis is that explicitly optimizing to reduce OC errors will improve segmentation performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies a common error type called "Out-of-Candidate" (OC) errors in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, where the predicted pixel labels contradict the image-level tags. 

2. It proposes a novel Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) mechanism to suppress these OC errors. The key ideas are:

- Adaptively split classes into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel based on prior annotation and posterior prediction correlations.

- Derive a differentiable rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift from the OC group to the IC group.

3. It incorporates OCR into various WSSS baselines like AffinityNet, SEAM, MCTformer, and shows consistent and significant performance gains on PASCAL VOC (+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8%) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5%). This demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of OCR.

4. The proposed OCR module is simple, plug-and-play, and incurs negligible extra computation overhead. It provides supervised signals to train better WSSS models, without extra costs during inference.

In summary, this paper identifies a previously overlooked error mode in WSSS, and proposes a novel and effective solution OCR to rectify it. The consistent gains across methods and datasets showcase the impact of this contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) mechanism to rectify segmentation predictions that contradict the image-level class labels by adaptively splitting classes into In-Candidate (IC) and Out-of-Candidate (OC) groups and using a rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group.
