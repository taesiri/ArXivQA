# AugESC: Dialogue Augmentation with Large Language Models for Emotional   Support Conversation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models be leveraged to augment crowdsourced dialogue data and improve downstream dialogue models' generalization ability? Specifically, the authors aim to address the limitations of current crowdsourced dialogue datasets, which are expensive to collect and limited in scale and topic coverage. They hypothesize that large language models can be used to automatically augment dialogue data through a dialogue completion approach, thereby improving generalization of downstream models trained on this data. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can treating dialogue augmentation as a dialogue completion task and leveraging large LMs lead to effective augmentation with reasonable quality?- Can the augmented dataset, AugESC, improve generalization capability of downstream dialogue models to open-domain topics compared to only using the original crowdsourced data?- How does this dialogue completion approach compare to strong baselines for dialogue augmentation like simulated conversation between separately trained models?- What is the quality of the augmented dialogues produced by this approach compared to crowdsourced and simulated dialogues based on human evaluation?So in summary, the central hypothesis is that large LMs can augment limited dialogue data through dialogue completion to improve generalization, and the key questions surround the effectiveness and quality of this approach. The human and automatic evaluations aim to validate the utility of the augmented dataset and compare dialogue quality across different augmentation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective approach for augmenting dialogue data using large language models. Specifically:- The paper presents an approach that treats dialogue augmentation as a dialogue completion task. By fine-tuning a large language model (GPT-J) on sample dialogues and then prompting it to complete full dialogues from various starting points, the authors are able to generate a large amount of augmented dialogues.- Using this approach, the authors construct AugESC, an augmented dataset for the emotional support conversation (ESC) task, which has 45x more dialogues and greatly extended topic coverage compared to the original crowdsourced ESConv dataset.- Through comprehensive human evaluation, the authors demonstrate that their approach produces higher quality augmented dialogues than strong baselines. The quality of AugESC is shown to be comparable to the crowdsourced ESConv. - Further human interactive evaluation verifies that post-training dialogue models on AugESC substantially improves their generalization capability to open-domain topics unseen during training.In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective dialogue augmentation approach via language model prompting, constructing a high-quality augmented dataset AugESC, and demonstrating its utility in improving dialogue models' generalization ability. The results highlight the potential of leveraging large language models to alleviate data scarcity issues for dialogue tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents an approach for augmenting dialogue data for emotional support conversation by fine-tuning a large language model to complete dialogues from prompt posts, and constructs an augmented dataset AugESC which improves generalization of dialogue models to open-domain topics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key aspects in comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper focuses on dialogue augmentation using large language models, specifically for the task of emotional support conversation (ESC). Other work has explored using language models for data augmentation, but not as much for dialogue tasks. The dialogue augmentation methods in this paper are novel.- The approach treats dialogue augmentation as a dialogue completion task by fine-tuning a large LM on existing dialogue samples and prompting it to complete new dialogues. This framing as dialogue completion is different from prior work like simulated conversation between separately trained agents.- The paper analyzes the quality and utility of the augmented dialogues in depth through human evaluation. Other related work has not evaluated the quality of augmented dialogues to this extent.- The AugESC dataset constructed in this paper is much larger and more diverse than existing crowdsourced ESC datasets like ESConv, greatly expanding the data scale and topic coverage.- This work focuses specifically on ESC, while related work has looked at augmentation for other tasks like chit-chat dialogue. The tailored analysis for ESC data is a novel contribution.- The paper demonstrates strong empirical results, with the augmented dialogues showing comparable quality to human-written dialogues and improving generalization of models to open-domain topics. This validates the efficacy of the proposed augmentation approach.In summary, this paper presents a new approach for dialogue augmentation using completion prompting of large LMs, provides in-depth analysis of the augmented data, and shows strong results on the ESC task. The focus on augmenting dialogues and the ESC domain makes this work unique compared to prior research. The scale and utility of the augmented dataset are significant contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring broader applications of their dialogue augmentation approach to other dialogue generation tasks beyond emotional support conversation, such as knowledge-grounded dialogue. They mention this could involve utilizing knowledge bases during the augmentation process.- Experimenting with even larger language models for dialogue augmentation to see if they can produce augmented dialogues with even better quality. They note that commercial models like GPT-3 are more powerful than open-sourced ones like GPT-J that they used.- Developing automatic methods for further quality refinement of the augmented dialogues. While they used heuristic-based postprocessing in this work, they mention fully automatic quality control mechanisms could be explored in the future.- Further investigation of the toxicity problem in augmented dialogues. They discuss the tradeoffs between reducing toxicity and improving dialogue quality, and suggest more work on this issue.- Exploring whether their approach could generalize to other dialogue tasks beyond emotional support and to other language models beyond GPT-J. The current work focused more on analysis and evaluation than on broader applications.In summary, the main future directions involve broadening the application of their augmentation approach, using larger language models, improving automatic quality control of augmented dialogues, mitigating potential toxicity, and testing generalization to other tasks and models. The authors frame this work as an initial demonstration of using large LMs for complex dialogue augmentation, which can hopefully inspire more research in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a simple yet effective approach for large-scale dialogue augmentation using large language models. The key idea is to treat dialogue augmentation as a dialogue completion task. The authors first fine-tune the 6B parameter GPT-J model on sample dialogues from the ESConv dataset to acquire the ability to complete full dialogues. They then prompt the fine-tuned model with emotional dialogue posts from EmpatheticDialogues to generate full dialogues on various topics. The generated dialogues are postprocessed with heuristics to remove undesirable cases. Using this approach, the authors construct AugESC, an augmented dataset for the emotional support conversation task, which contains 65K dialogues and is 45 times larger than the original ESConv dataset. Through comprehensive human evaluation, the authors demonstrate the superiority of their approach over strong baselines and show that AugESC has reasonable quality comparable to the crowdsourced ESConv dataset. Further human interactive evaluation verifies that finetuning dialogue models on AugESC notably improves their generalization capability to open-domain topics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of large language models in improving data-scarce dialogue tasks and generating reasonable quality augmented dialogues.
