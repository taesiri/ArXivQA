# [Improving the Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks with Knowledge   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10924)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the interpretability of deep neural networks while maintaining good performance? Specifically, the authors aim to resolve the tension between interpretability and accuracy performance of deep neural networks. They do this by using knowledge distillation to distill knowledge from a complex deep neural network (the teacher model) into a more interpretable decision tree model (the student model). The main hypothesis is that by treating the problem as a multi-output regression task and using the logits from the teacher model as soft targets to train the student model, they can significantly improve the accuracy of the decision tree compared to a vanilla decision tree trained normally. This results in a model that is more interpretable due to its tree structure, while also having accuracy closer to that of a deep neural network.In summary, the central research question is how to make deep neural networks more interpretable without sacrificing too much accuracy, and the hypothesis is that knowledge distillation into decision trees can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a method for improving the interpretability of deep neural networks using knowledge distillation. The key contributions are:- They propose distilling knowledge from deep neural networks into decision trees to obtain models that are both high-performing and interpretable. - They reformulate the multi-class classification problem into a multi-output regression problem so that decision trees can be trained directly using the logits from the neural network as targets. - They demonstrate their approach on the MNIST and Connect-4 datasets, showing that the distilled decision trees achieve 1-5% higher accuracy compared to vanilla decision trees at the same tree depth.- To my knowledge, this is the first work to distill knowledge from neural nets into vanilla decision trees for multi-class classification problems. In summary, the main contribution is presenting an approach to improve the interpretability of decision trees by transferring dark knowledge from complex deep models, while still maintaining high accuracy. This helps resolve the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on interpreting and improving the interpretability of deep neural networks:- It focuses on using knowledge distillation to distill a neural network into a decision tree, in order to improve interpretability while maintaining accuracy. This is a novel approach compared to other methods like generating explanations or visualizations for an existing neural network. - Most prior work on distillation has focused on compressing neural nets into smaller or shallower neural nets. Distilling into a decision tree allows interpretability via the tree structure.- The method treats the problem as multi-output regression in order to generate continuous outputs that can match the neural net logits, enabling the distillation process. This reformulation is key to making the approach work.- Experiments demonstrate sizeable accuracy gains compared to normal decision tree training, proving the effectiveness of the knowledge distillation approach for this purpose.- The focus is on global interpretability of the full model, as opposed to local explanations of individual predictions. - It builds on common distillation techniques like matching logits, rather than developing new distillation methods. The novelty is in the application to decision trees for interpretability.Overall, this paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting neural networks, with a solid technical approach and promising results. It expands the application of knowledge distillation in a creative way to address the important problem of interpretability in deep learning. The technique could be applicable to other inherently interpretable models besides decision trees as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other methods to solve the multi-output regression problem for knowledge distillation. The paper used the algorithm adaptation method to handle multi-output data, but the authors suggest trying other techniques like problem transformation methods. This could help take full advantage of knowledge distillation.- Designing new inherently interpretable machine learning models that can match the performance of non-interpretable models like deep neural networks. The authors' approach makes it possible to improve simpler interpretable models, so developing new models tailored for this could allow achieving both interpretability and high accuracy.- Adding a temperature term into the softmax layer and using both soft targets and true labels together to train the student model. The paper used a basic matching logits approach, but incorporating ideas from the original knowledge distillation framework could further improve performance.- Applying the knowledge distillation approach to other interpretable models beyond decision trees. The authors only experimented with distilling knowledge into decision trees, but suggest this could work for improving other transparent models. - Testing the approach on larger and more complex datasets. The experiments were on MNIST and a small Connect-4 dataset, but scaling up to bigger real-world datasets would better demonstrate the capabilities.- Investigating if combining interpretability techniques like visualizations along with knowledge distillation can enhance model explainability. The authors focus only on distillation for interpretability, but suggest interpretability itself is still not well defined.In summary, the main directions are around exploring enhancements to the knowledge distillation approach, applying it to new types of transparent models, testing on larger datasets, and combining it with other interpretability methods to further improve model explainability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes using knowledge distillation to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) by distilling them into decision trees. Knowledge distillation refers to transferring the knowledge learned by a large, complex teacher model to a smaller, simpler student model. The authors employ the "matching logits" approach where the logits (pre-softmax outputs) of a trained DNN teacher model are used as soft targets to train a decision tree student model on the original training data. This allows the decision tree to learn from the dark knowledge encoded in the DNN's soft targets. The authors reformulate the classification problem as a multi-output regression problem to enable training a decision tree on continuous logit values. Experiments on the MNIST and Connect-4 datasets show the student decision tree models achieve significantly higher accuracy (1-5% higher) compared to vanilla decision trees at the same tree depth, thereby improving interpretability without sacrificing performance. Overall, this method demonstrates an effective way to distill knowledge from complex DNNs into interpretable decision tree models.

Knowledge distillation refers to transferring the knowledge from a complex teacher model to a simpler student model. Specifically, the authors distill the knowledge from a DNN teacher model into a decision tree student model in order to attain good performance and interpretability. The key contribution is reformulating the classification task as a multi-output regression problem.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper applies knowledge distillation to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs). Knowledge distillation involves transferring the knowledge from a large, complex teacher model (typically a DNN) to a smaller, simpler student model. The authors use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the teacher models and decision trees as the student models. They formulate the multi-class classification problem as a multi-output regression problem so that the student model can be trained to match the logits (pre-softmax outputs) of the teacher model. This allows the decision tree student model to attain higher accuracy compared to a normal decision tree trained directly on the data labels. Experiments on the MNIST and Connect-4 datasets show the student model achieves 1-5% higher accuracy than vanilla decision trees at the same tree depth. Overall, the method enables training highly interpretable decision tree models that have enhanced accuracy through distillation of knowledge from complex DNNs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of improving the interpretability of deep neural networks while maintaining good performance. Specifically, the authors aim to develop models that have both high accuracy and interpretability. The main problem the paper tries to tackle is that deep neural networks, despite their excellent performance on many tasks, are complex black box models that are hard to interpret and understand. This lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in areas like healthcare where being able to explain predictions is important. On the other hand, models like decision trees are easy to interpret but don't achieve the same level of accuracy as deep neural networks on complex tasks involving large datasets. So the key question the paper aims to address is - how can we attain both high accuracy and interpretability in a single model?
