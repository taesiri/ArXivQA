# [Interfacing Foundation Models' Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07532)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation model embeddings across vision and language domains. FIND enables a shared interleaved embedding space where vision and language embeddings can be seamlessly combined for various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, etc. A lightweight transformer interface is designed that can interface arbitrary vision and language foundation models without fine-tuning their weights. Different tasks are implemented by prototyping attention masks and embedding types. FIND demonstrates strong performance on the newly introduced interleaved segmentation and retrieval tasks on the proposed FIND-Bench benchmark, as well as competitive results on standard retrieval and segmentation datasets. The unified multi-task training creates an interleaved shared space where visual and textual representations can be interchanged, enabling zero-shot cross-modal capabilities. Key strengths are generalizability across tasks/models, prototypability for new objectives, interleaveability between modalities, and extendibility to new techniques. The work provides both a strong benchmark and an effective interface for bridging vision and language foundation models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an interface called FIND that aligns foundation models' embeddings. Can you explain in more detail how FIND works to align the embeddings from vision and language foundation models? 

2. One key attribute of FIND is that it is generalizable to various tasks like retrieval and segmentation under the same architecture and weights. How does FIND achieve this generalizability across different tasks?

3. FIND uses attention masks and embedding types to prototype different tasks. Can you provide some examples of how attention masks and embeddings are configured for tasks like grounded segmentation and interleaved retrieval?

7. For the interleaved grounded segmentation task, how are the search queries formulated? What constitutes the search space?

8. The paper compares FIND against several baselines on tasks like interleaved retrieval and segmentation. Can you summarize the key results and reasons for FIND's superior performance?

9. What are the two main operator modules used in the FIND interface and how do they help in gathering and constraining information from the input embeddings?

10. Qualitative results are shown for interleave segmentation and retrieval. Can you describe 1-2 example output segments/images and explain why they demonstrate the effectiveness of FIND?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the rapid progress in foundation models for vision (e.g. SAM) and language (e.g. LLaMA), there is a need to bridge their embedding spaces to enable multi-modal and multi-task learning. However, existing methods like BLIP-2 and LLaVa feed the vision model outputs into the language model decoder, limiting their flexibility. There is also a lack of benchmarks for evaluating interleaved image-text understanding involving both images and text.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FIND (INterface for Foundation models' embeDDings), a generalized interface to align vision and language foundation model embeddings for multi-modal learning. The key components are:

1) An embedding sampler to obtain image, text and interleaved embeddings.

2) Content and conditional attention mechanisms to enable flexible masking and information gathering across modalities/tasks. 

3) Task prototype templates that allow new tasks to be added just by changing the attention mask.

4) New interleaved segmentation and retrieval tasks on a proposed COCO-based benchmark called FIND-Bench.

Main Contributions:

1) A flexible interface FIND that can jointly learn various vision-language tasks like segmentation, retrieval etc. while keeping foundation model weights fixed.

2) The ability to prototype new tasks without changing model architecture. FIND creates an interleaved shared embedding space across modalities.

3) State-of-the-art results on FIND-Bench for new interleaved tasks. Comparable performance to recent methods on other benchmarks.

4) Two new tasks and carefully designed benchmark FIND-Bench for evaluating interleaved image-text understanding.

In summary, this paper presents a novel interface to align foundation model embeddings across vision and language for multi-task learning, with very promising results on standard and new proposed benchmarks.
