# [MaiBaam: A Multi-Dialectal Bavarian Universal Dependency Treebank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10293)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks cover 140+ languages but lack diversity within high-resource languages, e.g. for German. 
- No UD treebank exists for Bavarian, a Germanic language variety closely related to German, spoken by over 10 million people in Germany, Austria and Italy.  
- Bavarian comprises several dialects and lacks standardization, making it challenging to collect and annotate data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present MaiBaam, the first multi-dialect Bavarian UD treebank.
- It contains 15,000 tokens covering diverse genres (wiki, fiction, grammar examples, social media, non-fiction) and dialects from all Bavarian-speaking regions.
- Annotation guidelines are provided for structures differing from German, e.g. analytic possession, article+name order.
- The data comes from various public sources to maximize dialectal and genre diversity.

Main Contributions:
- First UD treebank for Bavarian with POS and syntactic dependency annotations
- Guidelines for annotating Bavarian structures not found in Standard German
- Analysis of morphological and syntactic differences between Bavarian and German
- Detailed error analysis of parser performance showing lower scores than German and substantial variance across parsers
- Publicly released dataset to support future research on Bavarian NLP and contrastive analysis with other Germanic languages

In summary, this paper introduces the first manually annotated Bavarian UD treebank covering diverse dialects and genres. It highlights linguistic differences from German, provides annotation guidelines and baseline parsing results. The dataset enables future research on this under-resourced language variety.
