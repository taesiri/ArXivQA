# [Make-A-Video: Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key contributions and research focus of this paper seem to be:1. Proposing Make-A-Video, an approach to translate progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation to text-to-video (T2V) generation. The main hypothesis is that a T2I model can be extended to T2V by learning what the world looks like from text-image data and how the world moves from unlabeled video data.2. Showing that pairing a strong T2I model with unsupervised video data enables high-quality T2V generation without needing paired text-video data. The paper hypothesizes that the visual and multimodal representations learned by the T2I model accelerate T2V training.3. Designing novel spatiotemporal modules like pseudo-3D convolutions and attention to extend a T2I model for video generation. The hypothesis is these modules can effectively capture motion and temporal dynamics.4. Developing super-resolution techniques to increase spatial and temporal resolution of videos for the first time in T2V generation. The hypothesis is these can produce high-definition, high frame rate videos.5. Demonstrating state-of-the-art T2V generation results, evaluated on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The hypothesis is the proposed Make-A-Video approach outperforms existing T2V methods.In summary, the main hypothesis is that extending a strong T2I model with spatiotemporal representations learned from unlabeled video can achieve high-quality T2V generation without paired text-video supervision. The paper aims to demonstrate this through both model design and experimental results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing Make-A-Video, an approach to translate progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation to text-to-video (T2V) generation. The key ideas are:- Leveraging existing T2I models to learn text-visual world correspondence.- Using unsupervised learning on unlabeled videos to learn realistic motion. 2. Designing effective spatiotemporal modules to extend T2I models to handle video, including pseudo-3D convolution and attention layers.3. Developing strategies for high resolution, high frame rate video generation using a spatiotemporal pipeline with a video decoder, interpolation model, and super resolution models. 4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art T2V generation results, evaluated on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The model does not require paired text-video data.5. Collecting a new test set of 300 text prompts for zero-shot T2V evaluation.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing Make-A-Video, a novel and effective approach to "translate" recent progress in T2I modeling to the more challenging T2V problem, without requiring difficult-to-obtain paired text-video data. The method achieves new state-of-the-art results by leveraging T2I models and unsupervised video data.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper on Make-A-Video presents a novel approach for text-to-video generation that builds on recent progress in text-to-image modeling. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Leverages text-to-image models rather than training from scratch: This allows the method to take advantage of representations already learned from large text-image datasets, accelerating T2V training. Other works like CogVideo and VDM collect paired text-video data from scratch.- Does not require paired text-video data: By utilizing a pre-trained T2I model and then simply unsupervised video data, the method avoids the need for difficult-to-obtain aligned text-video pairs. This could enable scaling to larger video datasets.- Novel spatiotemporal architecture design: The pseudo-3D convolution and attention layers provide an efficient way to extend strong T2I models to the temporal dimension. This is a different design from prior works like VDM and CogVideo.- High resolution, high frame rate generation: The proposed spatial and temporal super-resolution models generate higher fidelity videos than prior T2V works like GODIVA or NÃœWA.- More thorough evaluation: Both automatic metrics and human evaluations on a diverse test set demonstrate SOTA qualitative and quantitative performance. The zero-shot evaluations also show better generalization than methods like CogVideo.Overall, by creatively combining text-image priors with unsupervised video in a novel model design, Make-A-Video pushes the state-of-the-art for controllable video generation without paired supervision. The work provides both an advancement in capabilities and a strong benchmark for future research.
