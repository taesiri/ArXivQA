# [Integrating Hyperparameter Search into GramML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- AutoML has become popular to reduce the time and expertise required to design ML systems, but still faces challenges like defining and efficiently exploring the solution space.
- Recent works use context-free grammars and tree search to address this, but most limit the search to pipeline structures and use default hyperparameters. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an extension to GramML, a model-free RL approach for AutoML based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over a grammar.  
- They incorporate hyperparameter values into the grammar rules to expand the search space.
- They modify the MCTS algorithm to add pruning and new selection policies (UCT, BTS, TPE) to handle the larger search space.

Key Contributions:
- Incorporates hyperparameter search into grammar-based AutoML to greatly expand the search space.
- Introduces pruning and new selection policies in the MCTS algorithm to efficiently search the larger space.  
- Shows statistically significant improvements over GramML, Auto-Sklearn, and MOSAIC on an OpenML benchmark, especially for a BTS-based variant.

The ablation study analyzes the impact of selection policy parameters on search efficiency. The comparison with other methods demonstrates the value of adding hyperparameter search to grammar-based AutoML, setting the stage for future work on incorporating meta-learning and execution time constraints.
