## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Visual navigation presents challenges for visually impaired individuals in dynamic urban environments. Existing object detection models have limitations in handling complex real-world scenarios. 

- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for vision-language understanding but their potential for accessible technologies and safety applications remains unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a framework integrating lightweight object detection with LLMs for real-time anomaly detection to enhance navigation safety. 

- Uses state-of-the-art YOLO-World model for customizable open-vocabulary object detection from camera frames.

- Specialized prompts submitted to LLM module guide analysis of detected objects and classification of potential obstacles/anomalies.

- LLM module also generates audio alerts and scene descriptions for users emphasizing abnormalities and safety hazards.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates feasibility of combining computer vision and LLMs for accessible anomaly detection in complex environments.

- System optimization for real-time performance with minimal latency critical for safety applications.

- Exploration of prompt engineering techniques to elicit desired LLM responses for this domain.

- Introduces image splitting method to categorize object locations and better assess threats.

- Testing shows high detection accuracy and system's ability to transition between environments. 

- Proposed approach has significant potential to enhance navigation independence and safety for visually impaired individuals.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative integration of object detection and LLMs to deliver real-time, personalized alerts during navigation while exploring prompt engineering for accessibility. The system shows promise in improving safety and accessibility in dynamic real-world environments.
