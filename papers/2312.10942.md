# [ShuttleSHAP: A Turn-Based Feature Attribution Approach for Analyzing   Forecasting Models in Badminton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10942)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the stroke forecasting task in badminton. This involves predicting a player's future strokes (shot type and landing location) in a rally based on past strokes. Recent deep learning models like ShuttleNet show promising performance but behave like black boxes, making it hard to understand what features the model uses to make predictions. Existing model explanation methods like SHAP, TimeSHAP, TrajSHAP cannot properly attribute temporal or player contributions in this turn-based multi-agent setting. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ShuttleSHAP, a model-agnostic explanation framework to analyze badminton forecasting models. It extends SHAP values to quantify contribution of features not only temporally (past strokes) but also from player aspects (player styles). It also enables multi-output explanations for shot type and landing location predictions. Reference values for dropped strokes are set to a default defensive return to the court center.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes the first feature attribution method, ShuttleSHAP, for turn-based forecasting models to enable temporal and player attributions for multi-output predictions.

2) Analysis using ShuttleSHAP uncovers that ShuttleNet does not rely much on past strokes for future predictions, likely due to its causal intervention design. In contrast, sequential models like TF suffer from confounding effects between player styles, past and future strokes.  

3) Player styles are shown to have a large influence on predicting future strokes for both ShuttleNet and TF, especially when less past context is available.

4) A case study demonstrates how ShuttleSHAP can help analyze model behaviors for a specific rally to potentially improve training and tactics.
