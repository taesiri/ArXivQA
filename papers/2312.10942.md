# [ShuttleSHAP: A Turn-Based Feature Attribution Approach for Analyzing   Forecasting Models in Badminton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10942)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the stroke forecasting task in badminton. This involves predicting a player's future strokes (shot type and landing location) in a rally based on past strokes. Recent deep learning models like ShuttleNet show promising performance but behave like black boxes, making it hard to understand what features the model uses to make predictions. Existing model explanation methods like SHAP, TimeSHAP, TrajSHAP cannot properly attribute temporal or player contributions in this turn-based multi-agent setting. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ShuttleSHAP, a model-agnostic explanation framework to analyze badminton forecasting models. It extends SHAP values to quantify contribution of features not only temporally (past strokes) but also from player aspects (player styles). It also enables multi-output explanations for shot type and landing location predictions. Reference values for dropped strokes are set to a default defensive return to the court center.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes the first feature attribution method, ShuttleSHAP, for turn-based forecasting models to enable temporal and player attributions for multi-output predictions.

2) Analysis using ShuttleSHAP uncovers that ShuttleNet does not rely much on past strokes for future predictions, likely due to its causal intervention design. In contrast, sequential models like TF suffer from confounding effects between player styles, past and future strokes.  

3) Player styles are shown to have a large influence on predicting future strokes for both ShuttleNet and TF, especially when less past context is available.

4) A case study demonstrates how ShuttleSHAP can help analyze model behaviors for a specific rally to potentially improve training and tactics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ShuttleSHAP, a novel model-agnostic feature attribution method to analyze forecasting models in badminton by quantifying the contributions of not only temporal aspects but also player aspects in terms of multifaceted cues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. It proposes ShuttleSHAP, the first feature attribution method for the turn-based forecasting problem. ShuttleSHAP is a model-agnostic explainer that can quantify the contributions of features not only from a temporal aspect but also from a player aspect. It also enables multi-output performance attributions.

2. ShuttleSHAP reinforces the capability to quantify the contributions of not only the temporal aspect but also the player aspect. It also supports multi-output performance attribution for sequential prediction tasks. 

3. The analysis using ShuttleSHAP revealed that the turn-based model (ShuttleNet) does not rely much on past strokes for future simulation, likely due to its causal intervention design. In contrast, conventional sequential models suffer from confounding effects between player styles and stroke trajectories. The analysis also showed that player interactions provide important cues for reasoning about future strokes in both models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing ShuttleSHAP, a new feature attribution method tailored for turn-based forecasting models, and using it to analyze existing turn-based and sequential models to uncover new insights into their behaviors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- ShuttleSHAP - The proposed turn-based feature attribution approach for analyzing forecasting models in badminton.

- Turn-based sports analytics - Analyzing sports like badminton that involve two players alternating actions (turns).

- Stroke forecasting - Predicting future strokes (shots) in a badminton rally given past strokes. 

- Feature attribution - Explaining which input features are most important for a model's predictions.

- Shapley values - A game theoretic approach to attribute contributions of features to a model's output.

- Player influence attribution - Proposed method to quantify how much each player's style contributes to predictive performance. 

- Past stroke attribution - Proposed method to quantify how much past strokes in a rally contribute to future stroke predictions.

- Confounding effects - Spurious correlations between variables that affect model predictions.

- Causal intervention - Modifying models to remove spurious variable relationships.

The key focus is on explaining stroke forecasting models in badminton using novel feature attribution methods based on Shapley values. The methods aim to uncover the contribution of past strokes and player styles to predictions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called ShuttleSHAP for feature attribution in turn-based forecasting models. Can you explain in detail how ShuttleSHAP extends the SHAP method to incorporate temporal and player aspects in its attributions? 

2. ShuttleSHAP quantifies the contribution of input features to the model's predictive performance rather than just its output. Why is this an important distinction to make in the context of analyzing sports forecasting models?

3. The paper argues that existing temporal attribution methods like TimeSHAP and TrajSHAP are insufficient for analyzing turn-based sports models. What are the key limitations they identify in these methods when applied to badminton stroke forecasting?

4. Explain the rationale behind the defensive stroke design for the reference value when dropping input features in ShuttleSHAP. Why is this a better choice than typical reference values used in other SHAP implementations?

5. The paper analyzes two models - ShuttleNet and TF. What differences did ShuttleSHAP uncover between these models in terms of their utilization of past strokes versus player styles for making predictions?

6. ShuttleNet does not rely much on past strokes. The paper hypothesizes the causal intervention design eliminates confounding effects - explain this argument and the underlying causal model in detail.  

7. The local analysis case study demonstrates how ShuttleSHAP can provide interpretable insights into model behaviors for domain experts. Suggest additional ways the attribution values could further assist practitioners.

8. TimeSHAP averages Shapley values across a sequence whereas TrajSHAP takes the maximum. This paper opts for averaging - discuss the limitations of the other two choices for this problem setting.

9. The paper focuses only on badminton due to dataset availability. Discuss the adaptability of ShuttleSHAP to other turn-based sports and any potential differences to consider.

10. Can you suggest any promising extensions or open problems for temporal and player attribution methods in turn-based forecasting based on this paper?
