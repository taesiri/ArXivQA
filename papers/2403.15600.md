# [Just another copy and paste? Comparing the security vulnerabilities of   ChatGPT generated code and StackOverflow answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models like ChatGPT are being widely adopted for software development. However, there are concerns about potential security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code propagating to downstream software systems. 

- Developers need to decide whether to use AI models or traditional information sources like Stack Overflow. Empirical data comparing the security of both is required to inform developer choices.

Methodology:
- Compare security vulnerabilities in 108 Java code snippets - 90 from Stack Overflow answers and 90 ChatGPT-generated snippets responding to the same Stack Overflow questions.

- Use CodeQL, a static analysis tool, to detect vulnerabilities and associated Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) in all snippets.

Results:
- Found 274 total unique vulnerabilities and 30 different CWE vulnerability types overall. 

- ChatGPT snippets had fewer total vulnerabilities (248 vs 302 in Stack Overflow), fewer vulnerability types (18 vs 26), and fewer snippets with vulnerabilities.

- However, 25% vulnerability overlap between platforms shows both can propagate insecure code.

Conclusions:
- Developers should not blindly trust any copied code, whether AI or human generated. Good security practices are essential when using code from outside sources.  

- While ChatGPT performed better security-wise, absolute numbers show room for improvement on both platforms to further secure software supply chains.

Main Contributions:
- First empirical comparison of security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code (ChatGPT) vs traditional web resource (Stack Overflow)

- Enhanced dataset linking SO content to ChatGPT snippets

- List of detected vulnerabilities and CWE types in both information sources to inform developer platform choices
