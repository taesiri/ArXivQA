# [Unsupervised Learning of Neurosymbolic Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13132v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an unsupervised learning approach to obtain interpretable and semantically meaningful latent representations, by combining neural networks with symbolic programs?

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Proposing neurosymbolic encoders, where part of the latent representation is computed by a symbolic program and the rest by a neural network. This aims to get the benefits of interpretability from the symbolic program and modeling capacity from the neural network.

- An unsupervised learning algorithm that combines variational autoencoder (VAE) training with program synthesis techniques to learn the neurosymbolic encoder along with a standard decoder.

- Evaluation on real-world trajectory datasets from animal behavior analysis and sports analytics. The results demonstrate that the neurosymbolic encoder leads to latent representations that better separate semantically meaningful categories compared to standard VAEs.

- Showing the practical utility by integrating the automatically learned programs into a downstream behavior analysis framework, achieving comparable performance to hand-designed expert programs for a behavior classification task.

So in summary, the main research contribution is an unsupervised neurosymbolic representation learning approach that produces interpretable and semantically meaningful latent representations. The key idea is learning neurosymbolic encoders that combine neural networks and symbolic programs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework for the unsupervised learning of neurosymbolic encoders. The key ideas are:

- Proposing neurosymbolic encoders, where part of the latent representation is produced by an interpretable symbolic program while the rest is computed by a neural network. This allows incorporating domain knowledge into the encoder via the program.

- Realizing the approach by combining VAE training with program synthesis techniques. The learning algorithm alternates between training the VAE and searching for better symbolic encoder programs via distillation.

- Evaluating the approach on real-world trajectory datasets from animal behavior analysis and sports analytics. The results demonstrate that the learned symbolic programs produce clusters that better align with human-annotated semantic labels compared to standard neural VAEs.

- Showing the practical utility of the unsupervised programs by integrating them into a downstream behavior analysis framework as a source of self-supervision. The automatically learned programs achieve comparable performance to expert-designed programs for the task.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel neurosymbolic encoder learning framework that can produce interpretable and semantically meaningful representations by leveraging symbolic domain knowledge, and demonstrating its effectiveness on real-world scientific datasets.
