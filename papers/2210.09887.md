# [MotionDeltaCNN: Sparse CNN Inference of Frame Differences in Moving   Camera Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we efficiently perform convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on videos captured with moving cameras? 

The key ideas and contributions to address this question seem to be:

- Proposing MotionDeltaCNN, a framework to accelerate CNN inference on videos with moving cameras by only processing sparse frame differences. This builds on prior work DeltaCNN that focused on videos with static cameras.

- Introducing "spherical buffers" - 2D ring buffers with wrapped coordinates that can align pixels from the current frame with previously processed regions to maximize reuse despite camera motion.

- Using "padded convolutions" to allow seamless integration of newly unveiled pixels from camera motion without artifacts or the need to reprocess seen pixels.

- Allowing dynamic initialization and bias addition for newly visible image regions unveiled by camera motion.

- Showing these techniques can enable much greater acceleration compared to prior work in the case of videos captured with moving cameras, with measured speedups of up to 90% compared to DeltaCNN and over 2x compared to standard dense processing.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that by using spherical buffers, padded convolutions, and other proposed techniques, the authors can efficiently accelerate CNN inference on videos with moving cameras by only processing sparse frame differences. The paper presents innovations in this direction and evaluations demonstrating significant speedups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a framework called MotionDeltaCNN that enables efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on videos with moving cameras. 

Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:

- Spherical buffers - Two-dimensional ring buffers that allow seamless integration of newly unveiled image regions from a moving camera into existing processed regions without increasing memory overhead. This is done by wrapping buffer coordinates.

- Padded convolutions - Adding padding to convolutional layers to process all pixels that could be affected by the kernel, including newly unveiled pixels. This allows fusing image regions from different perspectives correctly.

- Dynamic initialization - Resetting and initializing new tiles in the buffers when the camera pans over previously unseen areas, and adding biases to feature maps during inference to compensate.

Together, these concepts allow MotionDeltaCNN to achieve much higher frame rates compared to prior work like DeltaCNN in the case of videos captured with moving cameras. The system exploits temporal redundancy to only process sparse pixel differences between aligned frames rather than dense per-frame inference.

In experiments, MotionDeltaCNN is shown to outperform DeltaCNN by up to 90% on moving camera videos from the DAVIS dataset and also speeds up static camera inference when only regions of interest are processed. The main benefit is enabling efficient CNN video inference on low-power devices where dense processing may not be feasible.
