# [All Rivers Run to the Sea: Private Learning with Asymmetric Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Data privacy is a major concern when using cloud machine learning services, as sensitive user data is exposed to service providers during training and inference. Existing privacy solutions like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environments have limitations in performance, scalability, or accuracy.  

Proposed Solution (\method{} Framework):
The paper proposes a private training and inference framework called \method{} that decomposes intermediate representations (IRs) in neural networks into two asymmetric flows - an information-sensitive low-dimensional flow and a high-dimensional residual flow. 

The information-sensitive flow is fed to a small model running in a private environment like a trusted execution environment. The residuals are perturbed with differential privacy noise and binary quantization before sending to a large model on public cloud GPUs. This asymmetric decomposition allows accuracy-privacy tradeoffs superior to simply adding noise to IRs.

Main Contributions:

1) Asymmetric decomposition of IRs in neural networks to create low-dimensional privacy-sensitive representations and high-dimensional residuals.

2) Small private model design and perturbations to make residuals differentially private with minimal impact on accuracy.  

3) Superior accuracy-privacy tradeoff - e.g. 31% higher accuracy than differential privacy baseline for the same privacy budget.

4) Faster training and inference - e.g. 22x faster training than prior work by reducing communication between private and public environments.

5) Strong empirical privacy protection against model inversion and membership inference attacks.

In summary, the key innovation is the rigorous asymmetric decomposition to extract sensitive information into a low-dimensional submodel that runs privately. This enables accuracy, performance and privacy superior to prior techniques.
