# [Rethinking Loss Functions for Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The standard cross-entropy loss for training verdict predictors in the FEVER fact verification task fails to capture the heterogeneity among the three verdict classes - Supported (SUP), Refuted (REF), and Not Enough Info (NEI). 
- Treating all misclassification types uniformly is problematic as SUP and REF assume evidence is present while NEI means evidence is missing. So misclassifying SUP as REF or NEI should not be considered equal errors.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop two new loss functions tailored to FEVER - SRN and SR losses - to impose penalties of varying magnitudes based on the prediction error type.
- The SRN loss reduces penalties for false NEI predictions compared to SRC and REF errors.
- The SR loss focuses only on the contradictory SUP vs REF classes and disregards NEI.
- Both objectives are also combined with class weighting to handle training data imbalance.

Main Contributions:
- Propose two new loss functions specifically designed for the FEVER dataset to capture the heterogeneity of verdict classes.
- Demonstrate improved accuracy over standard cross-entropy loss using the new objectives.
- Show additional gains from combining with class weighting to mitigate label imbalance.
- Provide comprehensive empirical evaluation on the FEVER dataset with multiple classifier backbones.

The key insight is to develop objectives tailored to the nuances of the prediction classes rather than treating all errors uniformly. The proposed approaches outperform the standard loss, confirming their advantage for the FEVER task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores loss functions tailored for the FEVER fact verification task that impose different penalties based on the type of misclassification errors in order to capture the heterogeneity among the three verdict classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two new loss functions, called \srn and \sr, that are tailored for the FEVER fact verification task. These loss functions aim to capture the heterogeneity of the three verdict classes in FEVER (SUPPORTED, REFUTED, NOT ENOUGH INFO) by imposing different penalties for different misclassification types. Specifically, they penalize more for confusing a SUPPORTED claim as REFUTED (and vice versa) compared to confusing them with NOT ENOUGH INFO, based on the reasoning that SUPPORTED and REFUTED assume evidence is present while NOT ENOUGH INFO means evidence is missing. Experiments show that the proposed losses outperform the standard cross-entropy loss for training FEVER verdict predictors. The paper also explores combining the new losses with class weighting to handle class imbalance.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing verdict prediction loss functions that are specialized for the nuances of the FEVER dataset, demonstrating improved performance over generic classification losses like cross-entropy.

The paper explores loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss and custom loss terms, for the task of verdict prediction on the FEVER dataset. It aims to address the heterogeneity of the three verdict classes in FEVER by proposing loss functions that impose different penalties based on the type of misclassification. The paper also utilizes class weighting to deal with class imbalance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What motivates the authors to propose new loss functions tailored specifically for the FEVER dataset instead of using the standard cross-entropy loss? Describe the issues with treating all misclassification errors equally.

2. Explain the \srn and \sr loss functions in detail. How do they differ in their treatment of the verdict classes and imposing penalties?  

3. The paper argues that misclassifying a SUPPORTED claim as REFUTED should have a higher penalty compared to misclassifying it as NOT ENOUGH INFO. Do you agree with this viewpoint? Justify your answer.

4. How exactly does the class weighting scheme described help deal with class imbalance in the FEVER dataset? What is the intuition behind using the balanced class weights proposed by Cui et al. (2019)?

5. Analyze the confusion matrices in the Appendix (Tables 3-5). What trends can you observe regarding the effect of the proposed loss functions and weighting scheme on the predictions?

6. Should the hyperparameter λ in the loss functions be tuned? What was the effect of using fixed λ=1 instead of tuning it on the development set?

7. The proposed loss functions improve performance over cross-entropy when used with the KGAT model. Do you think they will be as effective when used with more recent state-of-the-art FEVER models? Why or why not?  

8. The gains obtained from the proposed objectives diminish with more powerful backbone architectures (BERT > RoBERTa). What could be the reason behind this?

9. The paper focuses only on modifying the loss function for the verdict predictor. Can you think of ways the evidence retrieval component could also be improved in KGAT using a similar approach?

10. The method here relies on having access to gold evidence during training. How can the ideas presented be extended to a scenario where only labeled claims are available rather than claim-evidence pairs?
