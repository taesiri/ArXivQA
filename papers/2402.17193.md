# [When Scaling Meets LLM Finetuning: The Effect of Data, Model and   Finetuning Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Understanding the scaling properties and inductive biases of different finetuning methods for large language models (LLMs) is important but under-explored. 
- Key factors that can affect LLM finetuning performance include LLM model size, pretraining data size, finetuning data size, parameter-efficient tuning (PET) parameter size, and finetuning methods.
- The paper aims to systematically study how these factors jointly scale for two popular finetuning approaches - full-model tuning (FMT) and PET (prompt tuning and LoRA).

Proposed Solution
- Propose a multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data size and other factors: performance = A/(X^α * D_f^β) + E, where X is another scaling factor.
- Conduct extensive experiments with bilingual LLMs (English-German/Chinese) from 1B to 16B parameters on machine translation and summarization.
- Compare scaling behaviours of FMT vs prompt tuning vs LoRA under factors like model size, pretraining data, and finetuning data.

Key Findings
- The proposed joint scaling law captures the empirical scaling trends well across tasks and methods. 
- Increasing model size benefits finetuning more than scaling pretraining data. PET parameter scaling is ineffective.  
- FMT relies more on finetuning data than PET. LoRA scales better with data than prompt tuning.
- Optimal finetuning method depends greatly on task and available finetuning data.
- PET encourages better generalization than FMT for zero-shot and few-shot transfer.

Main Contributions
- First systematic study on how key factors jointly scale for LLM finetuning.
- Proposition and verification of a multiplicative joint scaling law.
- Extensive experiments on bilingual LLMs from 1B to 16B parameters.
- Analysis and insights on scaling behaviours of different finetuning methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically studies the scaling behavior of different factors (LLM model size, pretraining data size, finetuning data size, PET parameter size) and finetuning methods (full-model tuning, prompt tuning, LoRA) for LLM finetuning, proposing a multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data and other factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is systematically studying the scaling properties of different factors, including model size, pretraining data size, finetuning data size, and finetuning methods, for large language model (LLM) finetuning. Specifically, the key findings are:

1) Proposing a multiplicative joint scaling law (Eq. 1 in the paper) that captures the relationship between finetuning data size and other scaling factors like model size.

2) Showing that LLM model scaling benefits finetuning more than pretraining data scaling, and scaling parameter-efficient tuning (PET) parameters is generally ineffective. 

3) Demonstrating that the optimal finetuning method is highly dependent on the task and availability of finetuning data. There are critical points for finetuning data size beyond which one method outperforms another.

4) PET methods like prompt tuning and LoRA depend more on base LLM knowledge and preserve better zero-shot capabilities than full model finetuning.

In summary, this work provides a systematic study and valuable insights on understanding scaling properties of different factors for LLM finetuning.

The paper explores how different scaling factors like LLM model size, pretraining data size, finetuning data size etc. affect the performance of different LLM finetuning methods. It proposes a multiplicative joint scaling law to model these relationships. The key goal is to understand how to select the optimal finetuning method given factors like the amount of finetuning data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a multiplicative joint scaling law (Eq. 1) to model the relationship between finetuning data size and other factors like model size. What is the intuition behind using a multiplicative formulation rather than an additive one? How does this impact extrapolation performance?

2. The scaling exponents for model size ($\alpha_m$) are generally higher than for pretraining data size ($\alpha_p$). Why might finetuning benefit more from larger models rather than larger pretraining datasets? Does this depend on the nature of the downstream task?

3. For parameter-efficient tuning methods like prompt tuning and LoRA, increasing the number of tunable parameters shows little performance gain. Why might scaling these parameters not be effective? Are there ways this scaling could be improved? 

4. The optimal finetuning method is shown to depend heavily on the downstream task and availability of finetuning data. What factors determine which method works best? Can you derive a guideline for selecting methods based on this work?

5. How does the scaling behavior differ between full-model tuning and parameter-efficient methods? For example, how does their reliance on pretraining factors and finetuning data differ? What causes these differences?

6. Prompt tuning and LoRA seem to retain more of the model's generalization capability compared to full tuning. Why might this occur? Does the amount of finetuning data or model size affect this?

7. The paper explores bilingual translation and summarization tasks. How might the scaling laws and finetuning method comparison differ for monolingual or multilingual tasks? For more open-ended generation?

8. Could the proposed joint scaling law be applied to other transfer learning scenarios like intermediate pretraining or training language models from scratch? How might the parameters change?

9. The scaling analysis relies on varying factors like model size and finetuning data separately. How could a joint scaling analysis be performed when multiple factors are tuned together (e.g. scaling up both simultaneously)? 

10. How sensitive are the determined critical points for optimal finetuning methods (Figure 5) to noise in the fitted scaling curves? Could uncertainty in the model fits impact selection of the best approach?
