# [Adam-like Algorithm with Smooth Clipping Attains Global Minima: Analysis   Based on Ergodicity of Functional SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) is known to converge to the global minimizer for non-convex losses under certain conditions. In contrast, convergence guarantees for adaptive optimization methods like Adam have been lacking.
- Previous work has shown Adam converges to stationary points, but not that it attains global minima for non-convex problems. Analyzing Adam is challenging since it lacks the Markov property that enables convergence analyses for SGLD. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a modified Adam-like algorithm with added smooth clipping and take the state space to be the set of all trajectories. 
- This enables forming a Markov process and finding a Lyapunov function, allowing the use of ergodic theory to analyze the asymptotic properties.
- Specifically, they show the analysis reduces to bounding the difference between two functional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with different drift terms.

Main Contributions:
- The authors prove the proposed Adam-like algorithm with smooth clipping approaches the global minimum of a regularized, non-convex loss function.
- Convergence rates are established explicitly for the discretization error (O(√η)), generalization error (O(1/√n)) and in terms of the optimization error (exponential convergence).
- To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first result showing an Adam-type algorithm can globally minimize non-convex objectives.
- The approach based on ergodicity of functional SDEs provides a framework for analyzing other adaptive optimization algorithms as well.

In summary, the paper provides valuable theoretical guarantees for an Adam-like algorithm to attain global minima of non-convex problems by framing the analysis in terms of the ergodic theory of functional stochastic differential equations.
