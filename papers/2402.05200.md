# [Are LLMs Ready for Real-World Materials Discovery?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown promise for materials science, but currently fall short in being practical research tools. They lack sufficient materials science knowledge and reasoning abilities to generate useful hypotheses or accelerate discovery.

- Key issues include: poor performance on materials science exams and reasoning tasks; inability to understand complex notation like crystal structures; lack of multi-modal understanding across text, tables, figures; inability to link knowledge across documents.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop specialized Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) with two key capabilities:
  1) Domain knowledge and grounded reasoning - understand materials concepts and principles to answer questions and generate hypotheses
  2) Augment materials scientists - perform useful tasks like information extraction, experiment planning, procedure generation  

- MatSci-LLMs need:
  - Exposure to multi-modal materials data (text, tables, figures) properly aligned and linked
  - Understanding of domain-specific notations and conventions 
  - Ability to reference and reason over interconnected concepts across documents

- A roadmap is provided for applying MatSci-LLMs to automate knowledge base creation, in-silico design, and connect to real-world labs.

Main Contributions:
- Analyzes limitations of current LLMs on materials tasks showing poor reasoning and notation understanding
- Defines requirements and challenges unique to MatSci-LLMs vs. general scientific or chemistry LLMs  
- Proposes a framework to develop MatSci-LLMs grounded in domain knowledge and hypothesis testing
- Identifies materials-specific multi-modal information extraction challenges from literature
- Provides a roadmap for deploying MatSci-LLMs to automate materials discovery and accelerate real-world research
