# [A Note on High-Probability Analysis of Algorithms with Exponential,   Sub-Gaussian, and General Light Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02873)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the analysis of randomized algorithms that use random variables with light tails (e.g. exponential, sub-Gaussian) for internal randomization. Such algorithms are usually analyzed assuming bounded noise, which simplifies the analysis but is a stronger assumption. The paper aims to reduce the analysis under light tails to an analysis under bounded noise in a black-box manner.

Proposed Solution:
The key result is a theorem that shows the following:
Given an algorithm that interacts for $n$ rounds with a sampling oracle (which provides samples from light-tailed distributions), there exists an alternative bounded oracle such that (i) the expectations of the distributions match (ii) with high probability, the outputs of the algorithm when run with the original vs bounded oracle are identical. 

The proof constructs the alternative bounded oracle by truncating samples from the original oracle to ensure boundedness, while correcting the bias. The theorem implies that to analyze the original algorithm, it suffices to analyze the simpler variant with bounded noise, inheriting the high-probability guarantees.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes analysis of randomized algorithms as interaction with sampling oracles over rounds.
- Provides a theorem to reduce analysis under light tails to easier analysis under bounded noise with only logarithmic loss in parameters.
- Applies the theorem to obtain variants of Azuma's inequality and SGD convergence under sub-Gaussian noise, highlighting its modular use.
- Shows tightness via an example where the logarithmic loss introduced is unavoidable.

The key advantage is that existing analyses that assume bounded noise can now be automatically extended to allow more general light tails, without needing tail-specific concentration inequalities. This enables simpler and more modular analysis of randomized algorithms.
