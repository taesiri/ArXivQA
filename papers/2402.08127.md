# [Efficient Contextual Bandits with Uninformed Feedback Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies contextual bandits with directed feedback graphs, which generalizes classic contextual bandits. In this setting, the learner makes a decision based on a context, suffers a loss and observes the losses of other decisions that have an edge to the selected decision in a feedback graph.  

- Prior work studied this problem when the feedback graph is revealed to the learner before making the decision (informed setting). However, in many applications, the feedback graph is not available or revealed after the decision (uninformed setting), which is more challenging.

- This paper focuses on the uninformed setting and designs the first efficient contextual bandit algorithm for this problem.

Proposed Solution:
- The algorithm builds on prior work \graphCB for the informed setting. It learns the losses using squared loss and the graphs using log loss simultaneously. 

- In each round, it predicts the losses and graph, plugs them into the decision rule of \graphCB to sample an action, suffers the loss, and uses the observed losses and graph to update the predictors.

- The analysis reveals that using log loss for graph prediction is critical. It relates the log loss of graph prediction to the squared loss regret due to graph unawareness.

Main Contributions:  
- First contextual bandit algorithm for uninformed feedback graphs that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\alpha(\calG) T})$ regret where $\alpha(\calG)$ is the maximum independence number.

- Shows the necessity of using log loss for graph prediction by relating it to squared loss regret.

- Improves the regret to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t})$ for the fully revealed setting where $\alpha_t$ is the independence number at round $t$.  

- Demonstrates the empirical effectiveness on a bidding application with both synthetic and real data.

In summary, the paper proposes the first efficient contextual bandit algorithm for uninformed feedback graphs with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. The analysis provides insights on properly learning the graph structure.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper develops the first efficient contextual bandit algorithm for the setting where the feedback graph is uninformed (only revealed after decisions are made), achieving strong regret guarantees both theoretically and empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes the first efficient algorithm for contextual bandits with uninformed feedback graphs. Specifically:

- It develops an algorithm called \graphCBp that efficiently reduces the problem to online regression over both the losses and the graphs. Importantly, it shows that using log loss instead of squared loss for learning the graphs is critical.

- In the partially revealed graph setting, it proves an $\otil(\sqrt{\alpha(\calG) T})$ regret bound, where $\alpha(\calG)$ is the independence number. 

- In the easier fully revealed graph setting, it achieves an improved $\otil(\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t})$ regret bound that adapts to the difficulty of each individual graph.

- It demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm on a bidding application using both synthetic and real-world data.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient reduction-based algorithm for contextual bandits with uninformed feedback graphs, along with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical validation. The work significantly expands the applicability of bandits with graphs by removing the restrictive assumption that graphs must be revealed before decisions.

The paper studies the problem of contextual bandits with uninformed feedback graphs. It makes realizability assumptions on the loss and graph functions and uses online regression oracles to learn them. A key concept is the independence number which characterizes the difficulty of the feedback graphs. The paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on optimizing a Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) and analyzes its regret bounds for both partially revealed and fully revealed graph settings. It also demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness empirically on a bidding application using synthetic and real-world data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning the feedback graphs using log loss rather than squared loss. Why is this important? Can you walk through the analysis to show the issues that would arise if squared loss was used instead?

2. The regret bounds for the partially revealed graph setting depend on the independence number $\alpha(\calG)$, while the bounds for the fully revealed setting depend on the per-round independence numbers $\alpha_t$. Intuitively, why is the algorithm able to adapt to the easier quantity $\alpha_t$ when given more graph information?

3. The algorithm reduction approach connects the regret to the sum of square loss regret $\RegSq$ and log loss regret $\RegLogG$. Walk through how these regret terms arise in the analysis. In particular, focus on the connections to Assumptions 2 and 3. 

4. Implementing the algorithm requires optimizing the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) on each round. Discuss the convex optimization problem that needs to be solved here. How does the relaxation of the $v^*$ variables to be real-valued simplify this?

5. The experiments consider a bidding application modeled as bandits with uninformed graphs. Walk through how this application fits into the problem formulation, clearly defining the actions, losses, and graph structure.  

6. Compare and contrast the synthetic and real-world datasets used in the experiments. What are the key differences and how do you expect algorithm performance to vary across them?

7. The paper leaves open the possibility of achieving per-round independence number regret in the partially revealed setting. Propose some ideas or algorithm modifications you think could lead to this improved bound. What are the obstacles?

8. How crucial is the realizability Assumption 1? Could the techniques be extended to agnostic or adversarial settings? What new issues arise in analyzing the regret without realizability?

9. The graph prediction uses linear classification while loss prediction uses neural networks. Justify these modeling choices and whether you might consider alternatives.

10. Based on the problem setting and results, suggest 1-2 real-world applications where this contextual bandits with uninformed graphs framework could be highly useful.
