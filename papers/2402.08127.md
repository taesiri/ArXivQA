# [Efficient Contextual Bandits with Uninformed Feedback Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies contextual bandits with directed feedback graphs, which generalizes classic contextual bandits. In this setting, the learner makes a decision based on a context, suffers a loss and observes the losses of other decisions that have an edge to the selected decision in a feedback graph.  

- Prior work studied this problem when the feedback graph is revealed to the learner before making the decision (informed setting). However, in many applications, the feedback graph is not available or revealed after the decision (uninformed setting), which is more challenging.

- This paper focuses on the uninformed setting and designs the first efficient contextual bandit algorithm for this problem.

Proposed Solution:
- The algorithm builds on prior work \graphCB for the informed setting. It learns the losses using squared loss and the graphs using log loss simultaneously. 

- In each round, it predicts the losses and graph, plugs them into the decision rule of \graphCB to sample an action, suffers the loss, and uses the observed losses and graph to update the predictors.

- The analysis reveals that using log loss for graph prediction is critical. It relates the log loss of graph prediction to the squared loss regret due to graph unawareness.

Main Contributions:  
- First contextual bandit algorithm for uninformed feedback graphs that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\alpha(\calG) T})$ regret where $\alpha(\calG)$ is the maximum independence number.

- Shows the necessity of using log loss for graph prediction by relating it to squared loss regret.

- Improves the regret to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t})$ for the fully revealed setting where $\alpha_t$ is the independence number at round $t$.  

- Demonstrates the empirical effectiveness on a bidding application with both synthetic and real data.

In summary, the paper proposes the first efficient contextual bandit algorithm for uninformed feedback graphs with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. The analysis provides insights on properly learning the graph structure.
