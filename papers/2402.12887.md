# [The practice of qualitative parameterisation in the development of   Bayesian networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian network (BN) development typically involves iterative stages of specifying purpose/scope, structure development, parameterisation, and validation. 
- Structure development focuses on qualitative issues and parameterisation on quantitative.
- However, there is often an intermediate step between structure development and full parameterisation where a "rough" parameterisation is done to capture the intended qualitative behavior of the model. 
- This step helps validate the structure, guides later parameterisation, but is rarely reported in the literature despite being a common practice.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the term "qualitative parameterisation" for this common but unnamed practice. 
- Qualitative parameterisation involves selecting parameters to represent the desired local and global qualitative behavior of the model rather than to provide accurate quantitative estimates.
- The qualitative behavior refers to how probabilities change under interventions or different evidence scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a clear definition and a name ("qualitative parameterisation") for a previously unnamed common practice.
- Explains the benefits of qualitative parameterisation in validating structure, guiding quantitative parameterisation, representing qualitative relationships.
- Gives examples of qualitative parameterisation using a simple illustrative Bayesian network.
- Situates qualitative parameterisation within the overall BN development process and clarifies its purpose relative to quantitative parameterisation.
- Calls for explicitly recognizing this practice, its uses and limitations.

In summary, the paper identifies and names the common practice of qualitative parameterisation in BN development, highlights its uses and value in capturing qualitative behavior and validating model structure, and argues it deserves more explicit recognition in the BN literature and process.
