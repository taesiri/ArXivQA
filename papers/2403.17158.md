# [Reflecting the Male Gaze: Quantifying Female Objectification in 19th and   20th Century Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the concept of the "male gaze" and resulting "female objectification" in literature, where women are depicted as passive objects for visual pleasure from a heterosexual male perspective. This can perpetuate harms against women. The authors propose a quantitative framework to measure female objectification along two axes: (1) agency bias - whether male entities are more likely to be grammatical agents than female entities, indicating lower female agency, and (2) appearance bias - whether female entities are more closely related to appearance words than male entities in the embedding space.  

Proposed Solution:
To measure agency bias, the authors use a semantic role labeler to analyze whether male or female entities are more likely to be agents. To measure appearance bias, they use the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) to compare associations between "female" words versus "male" words and a set of "appearance" words in the embedding space before and after fine-tuning on the target text. The change in relative associations indicates the appearance bias.

Experiments and Results:
The authors test their framework by analyzing female objectification in 79 popular 19th and 20th century English novels from Project Gutenberg. Overall, the novels exhibit significant positive agency bias and appearance bias, indicating female objectification. When separating by author gender, only novels by male authors show significant biases. Novels with a female narrator also do not show significant biases. The results suggest systematic female objectification exists in the male-perspective novels, where female characters must be more important to gain agency and non-appearance associations afforded to even minor male characters.

Main Contributions:
1) A quantitative framework to measure female objectification via agency bias and appearance bias metrics
2) Empirical evidence for a "male gaze" phenomenon that systematically objectifies women in 19th and 20th century English novels, specifically those written from a male perspective
3) Analysis showing that agency and non-appearance associations are reserved only for the most important female characters, while even minor male characters readily obtain these
