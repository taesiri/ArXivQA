# [An Implicit Physical Face Model Driven by Expression and Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D facial animation is typically controlled by facial rigs with intuitive parameters to manipulate facial deformations. A key component overlooked is the "style", or how a facial expression is performed based on individual differences in muscle activations.  
- Style is usually baked into the facial rig, making it hard to manipulate or transfer styles across characters.
- Physics-based facial models can simulate complex deformations and effects, but require laborious anatomy modeling and have only focused on single identities.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a new facial animation model based on an implicit neural physical simulation that can be driven by both expression and style parameters separately.
- Allow the model to be concurrently trained on motion capture data from multiple identities to learn a shared model, while still capturing individual styles.  
- Introduce a canonical space to map all identity spaces for unified learning, plus identity-specific warp functions.
- Use blendshape weights for expression and quantized codes for style parameters. Apply Lipschitz regularization to help disentangle expression and style spaces.
- Integrate a robust collision handling model.

Main Contributions:
- First implicit physical face model trained on multi-identity data, enabling generalized physics-based facial animation for multiple identities and extension to unseen performances.
- Allows control over animation style, enabling style transfer across characters or style blending.
- As a physics-based model, handles physical effects like collisions, friction, paralysis, bone reshaping etc.
- Applications demonstrated include facial animation retargeting, style transfer, and physical effect simulations.

In summary, the paper presents a novel data-driven implicit physical facial model that separates expression and style controls. Training on multiple identities allows greater generalization and animation control. The physics-based nature also facilitates complex physical simulations for enhanced realism.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new physics-based face model trained on multi-identity capture data that separates expression and style allowing control and transfer of both components across characters while also enabling physical effects like collisions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new facial animation model that can be driven by both expression and style separately. The key ideas include:

1) An implicit physical face model trained concurrently on animation data from multiple identities. This allows the model to learn a more comprehensive representation of human expression styles.

2) Introduction of a canonical space and identity-specific mappings to separate the learning and simulation spaces. This enables unified multi-identity training while retaining linkage to each identity's material space.

3) Parameterization of expressions using blendshape weights and styles using quantized style codes. Optimization with Lipschitz regularization helps disentangle expression and style spaces. 

4) Capability to synthesize physical effects like collision handling, setting it apart from conventional blendshape-based approaches.

5) Applications like facial animation retargeting, style transfer between identities, and artistic editing such as simulating facial paralysis or reshaping bones.

In summary, the main contribution is a multi-identity trained implicit physical model for facial animation that supports disentangled control over expression and style, and facilitates various applications difficult to achieve with traditional methods.
