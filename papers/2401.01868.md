# [Step length measurement in the wild using FMCW radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monitoring gait parameters like step length in homes is important to assess mobility and predict risk of falls/hospitalizations for older adults aging in place. 
- While radars have been used to measure gait speed at home, measuring step length is still an open challenge.
- Existing radar-based step length measurement techniques have only been evaluated in controlled settings using healthy subjects over long walk distances, making them impractical for home use.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a radar-based method to measure step length at home by tracking the torso using radar point clouds and detecting peaks in torso speed to get step lengths.
- The method is designed to work with short walk lengths and does not require constant speed, making it suitable for home use.

Evaluations:
- Performed extensive evaluation with 35 frail older adults in clinic over 625 walks under 5 conditions and compared to Zeno walkway. Average error was 5.5cm (10.2% of step length).
- 21 frail older adults evaluated system at home over 2 weeks. Showed excellent reliability (ICC=0.91) and consistency with clinic measurement (ICC=0.81).

Key Contributions:  
- First paper to demonstrate radar-based step length measurement with frail older adults both in clinic and uncontrolled home settings.
- Proposed step length measurement approach designed specifically for home use.
- Comprehensive assessment and validation of the approach using frail older adults in homes establishes feasibility of home step length monitoring to assess mobility.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling in-home step length measurement using radars to assess mobility for older adults aging in place, through a novel approach designed and extensively validated using frail older adults in homes.
