# [Chairs Can be Stood on: Overcoming Object Bias in Human-Object   Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02400)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper identifies and addresses an "object bias" problem in human-object interaction (HOI) detection, where current models tend to predict interactions solely based on the detected objects rather than considering the overall context. This bias arises from two factors: the inherently unbalanced interaction distribution per object in existing datasets, and models overfitting to the frequent interactions conditioned on each object type while overlooking rare cases. To alleviate this issue, the authors propose an Object-wise Debiasing Memory (ODM) module to facilitate more balanced sampling of interactions for each object during training. Specifically, ODM maintains a memory bank of HOI features per object, with carefully designed read and write strategies that prioritize sampling of rare interactions. By applying ODM to multiple HOI detection models, significant performance gains are demonstrated, especially on rare interactions per object. The method also achieves new state-of-the-art results on the HICO-DET and HOI-COCO benchmarks when evaluated under the standard protocols. Overall, this paper provides useful insights into the object bias problem in HOI understanding, and presents an effective approach to address it.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Object-wise Debiasing Memory module to overcome the object bias problem in human-object interaction detection by balancing the skewed conditional verb distribution to improve model performance, especially on rare classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. The authors systematically study the "object bias" problem in Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. To the best of their knowledge, they are the first to recognize and address this problem in the HOI literature. 

2. To alleviate the object bias problem, they propose a novel Object-wise Debiasing Memory (ODM) module to facilitate the learning of a balanced classifier. The proposed ODM is model-agnostic and applicable to both one-stage and two-stage HOI detection methods.

3. They conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets - HICO-DET and HOI-COCO. When applying their method to several HOI detection baselines, significant performance improvements are observed, especially on rare interactions under each object. As a side product, they achieve new state-of-the-art results on the two benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel ODM module to alleviate the newly identified "object bias" problem in HOI detection, which brings consistent and noticeable performance gains.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection
- Object bias problem
- Unbalanced interaction distribution 
- Biased model learning
- Object-conditional class balancing
- Object-wise Debiasing Memory (ODM)
- Memory reading strategies
- Memory writing strategies
- Rare/non-rare interactions under each object
- New evaluation protocol for object bias
- Performance improvements on HOI detection benchmarks (HICO-DET, HOI-COCO)

The paper focuses on identifying and overcoming the "object bias problem" in HOI detection, which refers to models predicting interactions mainly based on the conditional label distribution under each object, rather than the overall distribution. The proposed method is an Object-wise Debiasing Memory that facilitates more balanced sampling of interactions for each object during training. The effectiveness is shown through experiments on standard HOI detection datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Object-wise Debiasing Memory (ODM) module to overcome the object bias problem in HOI detection. Can you explain in detail how the read and write strategies for the ODM work? What is the intuition behind prioritizing rare classes in these strategies?

2. The ODM module maintains a separate memory cell for each object category. What is the motivation behind this design? How does it help mitigate the object-conditional label imbalance?

3. The paper evaluates performance under a new "object bias" protocol. Can you explain this protocol and how it helps quantify a model's capability of overcoming object bias? 

4. The method trains two classifiers - one on the original imbalanced distribution ($f_b$) and one on the balanced distribution from ODM ($f_m$). Why are both classifiers needed? How do they complement each other?

5. The paper compares with several existing debiasing methods like loss reweighting, general debiasing methods etc. How exactly do these methods differ from the proposed approach? Why do they underperform compared to the proposed ODM?

6. Can you analyze the evolution of verb distribution plots in Figure 5 and explain how they demonstrate the effect of the ODM module over training iterations?

7. Can you explain the false negative and false positive examples shown in Figure 6? How do they provide qualitative evidence for object bias in the baseline? 

8. The object bias problem is shown to be distinct from the general long-tail distribution problem studied in previous works. Can you summarize the key differences between them?

9. The paper achieves state-of-the-art results on both HICO-DET and HOI-COCO datasets. Can you attribute this performance gain to overcoming the object bias specifically?

10. The object bias problem likely exists in other human-centric understanding tasks like visual relation detection as well. Can the proposed approach be extended to handle bias in those settings? What adaptations would be needed?
