## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes TABSurfer, a novel deep learning model for subcortical brain segmentation in MRI scans. TABSurfer uses a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture applied in a 3D patch-based approach to capture intricate anatomical spatial relationships while compensating for the limited context of patches. The model was evaluated against the established FreeSurfer pipeline and the state-of-the-art FastSurferVINN deep learning model. Across over 1700 heterogeneous T1-weighted scans, TABSurfer demonstrated quantitatively superior performance to both methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and quality. Additional validation on manually annotated scans further verified TABSurferâ€™s strengths. With accelerated processing under 90 seconds, high adaptability to diverse data, and smoother segmentation contours, TABSurfer shows promising utility as an automated subcortical segmentation tool for structural brain analysis. The authors aim to improve model efficiency for expanded applications in future work.
