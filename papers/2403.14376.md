# [InfNeRF: Towards Infinite Scale NeRF Rendering with O(log n) Space   Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods have shown impressive view synthesis results, but primarily focus on small-scale scenes. Scaling up NeRF to large environments like cities or the entire Earth remains an open challenge. Key issues are the escalating memory requirements to store the entire model, inefficient data fetching, and aliasing artifacts when rendering low-resolution views.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes InfNeRF, a novel framework that integrates NeRF with a level-of-detail (LoD) octree structure to represent large-scale scenes. 

Key aspects:
- The scene is hierarchically partitioned into nodes spanning different spatial regions and level of details (scales). Each node contains a small NeRF model.
- During rendering, only a subset of nodes close to the camera view are retrieved, significantly reducing memory footprint. The complexity is O(log n) where n is the total scene information.
- Parent nodes act as smoothed, low-pass filtered versions, naturally reducing aliasing when zooming out.
- A pruning algorithm removes redundant nodes using sparse 3D points from structure-from-motion.
- A distributed training strategy maintains efficiency while scaling up.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes InfNeRF, a new method to extend NeRF to large-scale scenes through an LoD octree structure. Achieves efficient O(log n) rendering complexity.
- Integrates anti-aliasing capabilities to enhance visual quality, with over 2.4dB PSNR gain while accessing only 17% of parameters. 
- Develops tailored solutions like pruning and distributed training to further improve efficiency and scalability.
- Establishes a general framework to incorporate rapid NeRF advancements to handle large-scale scenes.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative integration of ideas from classical graphics like LoD with recent neural advances like NeRF. It unlocks new possibilities for immersive traversal of expansive environments at scale.
