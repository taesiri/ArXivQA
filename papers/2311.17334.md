# [Long-tailed multi-label classification with noisy label of thoracic   diseases from chest X-ray](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17334)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LTML-MIMIC-CXR, a new chest X-ray dataset for developing computer-aided diagnosis systems that can detect both common and rare thoracic diseases. The dataset builds on MIMIC-CXR by expanding the labeled disease categories from 13 to 39, using automatic annotation to add rarer conditions sourced from Radiology Gamuts. To handle challenges of long-tail distribution and noisy labels from automation, the authors propose a deep learning framework integrating adaptive negative regularization to prevent over-suppression of tail classes, and large loss reconsideration to account for annotation errors. Evaluation demonstrates significant gains over existing methods, with their approach improving balanced accuracy from 56.34% to 64.84% on the testing set. The LTML-MIMIC-CXR benchmark and proposed techniques establish a foundation for robust systems that balance recognition across a spectrum of diseases in chest radiographs. Overall, this work makes notable contributions in dataset curation and modeling to progress computer-aided diagnosis for comprehensive and precise identification of both common and rare thoracic diseases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a long-tailed multi-label chest X-ray dataset with 26 additional rare diseases and a deep learning method with adaptive negative regularization and large loss reconsideration to address the challenges of long-tailed distribution and noisy labels for comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors established a long-tailed multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) dataset named "LTML-MIMIC-CXR" containing extra 26 rare diseases (39 diseases in total) under the multi-label setting. This serves as a benchmark to aid the development of comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for CXR disease diagnosis.

2) The authors designed a novel deep learning-based method to address the challenges of long-tailed distribution and noisy labels in the LTML-MIMIC-CXR dataset. Their method includes an adaptive negative regularization (ANR) module to alleviate over-suppression of negative logits, and a large loss reconsideration (LLR) module to handle noisy labels. Evaluation shows their method improves the total balanced accuracy on LTML-MIMIC-CXR from 0.5634 to 0.6484.

In summary, the main contributions are the construction of the LTML-MIMIC-CXR benchmark dataset, and a new method to address long-tailed distribution and noisy labels that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an adaptive negative regularization (ANR) to alleviate the over-suppression of negative logits. How does ANR work? What is the motivation behind using a non-linear scaling factor λi instead of a simple linear scaling?

2. In the formulation of λi for ANR, the paper introduces a bias term vi to account for model bias. How is vi calculated? Why is it helpful to include this bias term? 

3. For the Large Loss Reconsideration (LLR) strategy, the paper states that noisy labels predominantly occur in negative samples. What is the reasoning behind this assumption? How valid is this assumption?

4. The paper implements two approaches for LLR - Large Loss Abandoning (LLA) and Large Loss Modifying (LLM). What are the differences between LLA and LLM? What are the relative pros and cons?

5. In the experiments, the results show LLA achieves better performance than LLM. Why might LLM introduce new labeling errors while correcting large losses? 

6. The parameter k determines the number of large losses to reconsider in LLR. The paper states k should increase as training progresses. What is the intuition behind dynamically adjusting k? How can we determine the schedule for adjusting k?

7. For the baseline methods compared in the experiments, what modifications were made to make them applicable for the long-tailed multi-label setting? Are there any other existing methods you might suggest comparing to?

8. The ANR method achieves strong improvements on tail classes. Does the performance on head vs tail classes represent a trade-off? How can we balance performance across head and tail?  

9. The paper utilizes automated annotation using CheXpert for expanding disease labels and thus contains noisy labels. If manual annotation was feasible, how much performance gain would be expected?

10. The method is evaluated on the LTML-MIMIC-CXR dataset introduced in the paper. How could the approach be adapted or improved if applied to other CXR datasets with different data distributions?
