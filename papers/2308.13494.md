# [Eventful Transformers: Leveraging Temporal Redundancy in Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13494)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

Can we exploit temporal redundancy between frames in videos to reduce the computational cost of applying vision transformers frame-by-frame or clip-by-clip?

The key ideas and contributions of the paper can be summarized as:

- Natural videos contain significant temporal redundancy between subsequent frames. However, vision transformers are typically applied from "scratch" to each frame, which is inefficient. 

- The paper proposes "Eventful Transformers", a modified transformer architecture that tracks changes at the token level across frames and selectively updates only those tokens that have changed significantly.

- This is achieved by introducing token gating modules that compare current tokens to stored references and determine which tokens need to be updated. Only updated tokens are passed through subsequent layers.

- The method updates both token-wise operations (like MLPs) as well as the query-key and attention-value products in the self-attention mechanism in a sparse manner.

- The number of updated tokens can be controlled in real-time via the token selection policy, enabling adaptive computation based on available resources.

- Experiments on video object detection and action recognition show 2-4x computational speedups with minor accuracy drops when converting state-of-the-art models to Eventful Transformers.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that exploiting temporal redundancy can significantly reduce the computational costs of applying vision transformers to videos, in an efficient and adaptable manner. The paper presents a novel method and provides experimental evidence to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing Eventful Transformers, a method to reduce the computational cost of vision Transformers for video processing tasks. The key ideas are:

- Exploiting temporal redundancy between frames/clips by selectively updating only those token representations that have changed significantly over time. This avoids recomputing everything from scratch on each frame.

- Adding token gating modules to Transformer blocks that track changes in tokens and determine which ones need to be updated. The gates give a level of adaptivity and control over the compute cost.

- Modifying the self-attention mechanism to compute sparse updates to the query-key and attention-value matrices, rather than full recomputations. 

- Showing that transforming existing vision Transformer models (e.g. for object detection and action recognition) into Eventful Transformers can lead to significant compute savings of 2-4x with minimal loss in accuracy.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a way to modify vision Transformers to exploit temporal redundancy and enable efficient, adaptive processing of video frames/clips. This helps address the high computational costs of standard Transformers for video tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Eventful Transformers that reduces the computational cost of applying vision Transformers to video data by exploiting temporal redundancy between frames and giving adaptive control over inference cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in efficient vision transformers and video understanding:

- The key novelty of this paper is exploiting temporal redundancy between frames/clips to accelerate vision transformers applied to video data. Most prior work has focused on spatial redundancy within a single image or accelerating transformers in general. This temporal focus enables savings complementary to spatial methods.

- For video understanding, there has been some work on exploiting temporal redundancy in CNNs, but little on transformers. The authors note the challenges in directly adapting CNN methods like skip connections due to architectural differences. The proposed gating mechanism and sparse update strategies are tailored for transformers.

- Compared to the one related transformer method STGT, this paper handles redundancy in self-attention in addition to feedforward layers. The gating mechanism also seems more robust, avoiding accuracy drops on gradual scene changes.

- For adaptivity, this method provides finer control over compute cost at runtime compared to prior transformer methods that adapt within a single input. Trading off accuracy and compute dynamically is useful for applications with varying resources.

- The experiments are quite extensive, demonstrating savings on major video tasks across multiple models. The code release is also useful for adoption. Results suggest 2-4x savings with minor accuracy drops.

Overall, this seems like a novel contribution applying an important concept (temporal redundancy) to an increasingly vital architecture (transformers) on demanding applications (video). The paper is clearly written and provides useful experimental validation. The work should be of broad interest to researchers working on efficient video recognition and transformers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further improve the speedups and efficiency of Eventful Transformers through engineering optimizations like custom CUDA kernels or high-performance inference frameworks. The speedups demonstrated in the paper use standard PyTorch operators, which likely have some overhead. More optimized implementations could lead to better runtime improvements.

- Explore more sophisticated token selection policies beyond just top-r or threshold-based policies. Ideas mentioned include learned policies or using importance scores to aid selection. Better policies could improve the accuracy vs. efficiency tradeoff.

- Combine Eventful Transformers with methods that exploit spatial redundancy. The paper shows a simple proof-of-concept experiment merging their temporal redundancy approach with spatial pooling. More research is needed on jointly modeling spatial and temporal redundancy. 

- Apply Eventful Transformers to a broader range of vision Transformer architectures and tasks beyond the object detection and action recognition models tested in the paper.

- Reduce the memory overheads of Eventful Transformers by removing temporal redundancy awareness from some components like the attention matrix. Memory optimizations would make the approach viable on more memory constrained devices.

- Study the differences between temporal and spatial redundancy and determine if they should be handled separately. The temporal axis may have unique properties compared to the spatial axes.

- Analyze the effects of common video preprocessing steps like frame rate adjustment on the redundancy assumptions and efficiency of Eventful Transformers.

So in summary, the main future directions are around optimizations to improve speed, accuracy and memory usage, expanding compatibility, and better understanding the temporal modeling properties. The overall goal is to advance Eventful Transformers as a general approach for efficient video recognition with Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Eventful Transformers, a method to reduce the computational cost of vision Transformers for video processing tasks. The key idea is to exploit temporal redundancy between consecutive video frames by selectively updating only those tokens in the Transformer whose representations have significantly changed from the previous frame. This is accomplished via token gating modules that track changes to tokens over time and determine which tokens need to be recomputed. The token gating logic is integrated into the Transformer architecture to avoid redundant computation in the token-wise operations like the MLP as well as the query-key and attention-value matrix multiplications. The number of updated tokens can be controlled in each Transformer block to enable adaptive inference under varying computational budgets. Experiments on video object detection and action recognition datasets demonstrate significant computational savings of 2-4x with minimal impact on accuracy when applying Eventful Transformers to state-of-the-art models. The code is publicly released.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Eventful Transformers, a method to accelerate vision Transformers for video recognition tasks. Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on image classification, object detection, and video classification but have very high computational costs. This makes their deployment challenging, especially for video which has massive data volumes. The key idea is to exploit the temporal redundancy between video frames to avoid redundant computation. Specifically, the method tracks changes at the token level between frames. It uses gating modules to identify which tokens have changed significantly and only updates those tokens and their corresponding self-attention components. This allows reusing computation from previous frames. The approach can be applied to existing models without retraining. Experiments on video object detection and action recognition show 2-4x reductions in computation with minor losses in accuracy.

Eventful Transformers use token gating modules to track changes versus reference tokens over time. Only tokens with large differences are selected for update. This accelerates token-wise operations like MLPs as well as the query-key and attention-value matrix multiplications. Tracked changes in the gate outputs allow efficient delta updates. The method supports different policies for selecting which tokens to update; a top-k policy works well. Eventful Transformer blocks can replace standard blocks in existing architectures. Experiments demonstrate significant computational savings on video object detection and action recognition with minimal impact on accuracy. The code is released to allow building Eventful versions of various models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Eventful Transformers, a new class of vision Transformer that leverages temporal redundancy between subsequent video frames to enable efficient, adaptive inference. The key idea is to track changes at the token level across frames and selectively update only those tokens in each Transformer block that have changed significantly since the last frame. This is achieved using token gating modules that compare current tokens to stored references, determine which tokens have changed beyond a threshold, and pass only those changed tokens on for recomputation. The paper shows how to modify Transformer blocks to exploit this sparse updating, accelerating operations like the query-key and attention-value matrix multiplications. The number of updated tokens can be controlled in real-time via the selection policy in the gates, enabling adaptive computation. Experiments show that converting state-of-the-art Transformer models to Eventful Transformers reduces computation by 2-4x on video tasks with only minor drops in accuracy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Vision transformers (ViTs) achieve excellent accuracy on vision tasks but have very high computational costs compared to convolutional neural networks. This limits their deployability, especially for video processing where the data volume is large. 

- The paper proposes a method to reduce the compute cost of ViTs for video processing by exploiting the temporal redundancy between frames. Videos have lots of redundancy between subsequent frames, but ViTs process each frame from scratch discarding this temporal information.

- The paper introduces "Eventful Transformers", which are ViTs that track changes at the token level across frames and selectively update only parts of the model on each frame. This avoids redundant computation on static image regions.

- A key component is a "token gating" module that detects which tokens have changed significantly vs a stored reference and selects those to update. The paper shows how to modify ViT blocks to incorporate this gating and sparse update logic.

- Experiments show they can reduce FLOPs on video tasks 2-4x with minimal accuracy loss by converting standard ViTs to be Eventful Transformers. The method also enables adaptive inference by controlling how many tokens are updated.

- Main limitations are engineering/implementation challenges to realize optimal speedups, and some extra memory overhead. But overall the paper presents a promising approach to exploit temporal redundancy in ViTs to improve efficiency.

In summary, the key focus is reducing ViT compute costs for video processing by avoiding redundant computation across frames. This is done via selective token updates based on detected frame differences.
