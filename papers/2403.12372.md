# [Learning Transferable Time Series Classifier with Cross-Domain   Pre-training from Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time series classification is an important task but deep learning models require extensive labeled training data which is costly to obtain. 
- Self-supervised learning can help by pre-training on unlabeled time series data but most methods focus within the same domain, missing chances to transfer knowledge across domains. 
- Cross-domain pre-training is challenging due to significant differences in time series characteristics (channels, resolutions, etc) across domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CrossTimeNet, a cross-domain self-supervised learning framework for time series.
- A core component is the time series tokenizer which converts continuous data into discrete tokens based on reconstruction, enabling unified representation.
- Masked token prediction is used as the pre-training task, predicting a higher proportion of corrupted tokens to learn more informative patterns. 
- A pre-trained language model (BERT) is unexpectedly found to be very effective as the encoder backbone for feature extraction.

Main Contributions:
- Novel time series tokenizer for cross-domain discretization and unified representation.
- Emphasis on masked token prediction pre-training for learning universal time series features.
- Discovery that language model encoders boost performance for time series tasks.
- Extensive experiments validate CrossTimeNet's superiority over existing methods on diverse real-world time series datasets.
- Framework helps overcome labeled data scarcity and provides a strong baseline for advancing research towards universal time series models.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative cross-domain pre-training paradigm for time series aimed at learning meaningful and transferable data representations to enhance downstream tasks, with empirical results confirming the potential of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CrossTimeNet, a novel self-supervised learning framework for pre-training time series representations across multiple domains by converting continuous time series into discrete tokens and using a masked token prediction task with a pre-trained language model as the encoder to learn transferable features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing CrossTimeNet, a novel framework for self-supervised pre-training of time series data across multiple domains. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) A time series tokenization module that can convert continuous time series into discrete tokens, enabling unified representation for cross-domain learning. 

2) Highlighting the benefit of predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens during pre-training for learning more informative patterns.

3) Using a pre-trained language model (BERT) as the encoder backbone for extracting time series representations, which is shown to be surprisingly effective. 

4) Conducting comprehensive experiments on real-world time series classification tasks across various domains like HAR, EEG, and ECG to demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossTimeNet in learning transferable representations.

In summary, the main novelty lies in the cross-domain self-supervised pre-training paradigm for time series aimed at learning universal representations, facilitated by the proposed time series tokenizer and adoption of pre-trained language model. The experimental results validate the superiority of CrossTimeNet.
