# [Extracting Self-Consistent Causal Insights from Users Feedback with LLMs   and In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Microsoft's Windows Feedback Hub receives a large volume of user feedback on Windows issues, making it challenging to diagnose root causes. There is a need to better understand and triage user-reported issues.  
- A key challenge is that causal analysis requires domain knowledge to build the causal graph. This knowledge is not always available.

Proposed Solution:
- Use large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning to extract causal variables (treatments, outcomes, confounders) and sequences of events from user feedback. 
- Generate a prior causal model to aid in the causal inference pipeline when domain knowledge is lacking.
- Design causal heuristics using the extracted insights to score feedback informativeness.

Main Contributions:
- A modified self-consistency approach using LLM prompt ensembles to reduce hallucination risk.
- Demonstration of using reasoning abilities of LLMs and in-context learning to extract causal insights from real user feedback data.
- Two causal heuristics for scoring feedback actionability based on number of extracted variables and causal chain length.
- Show 19% of extracted issues are new and undiscovered bugs based on real user data evaluation.
- Minimize out-of-domain responses to 0% through the proposed techniques.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to leverage large language models to extract reliable and previously unknown causal insights from user feedback, to aid in diagnosing issues and prioritizing bug fixing efforts. The proposed causal scoring also helps filter uninformative feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using large language models and in-context learning to extract causal variables and event sequences from user feedback data to generate causal graphs and score feedback informativeness for improving bug diagnosis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a modified self-consistency approach that uses an ensemble of prompts and a greedy strategy to extract causal variables (treatment, outcome, confounders) and sequences of events from user feedback data. This aims to mitigate issues like hallucination in LLMs and maximize the chance of capturing confounders.

2. Leveraging reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning to extract causal insights from user feedback data to construct a prior causal graph. This graph can serve as a heuristic to semi-automate the causal modeling process when domain knowledge is lacking.  

3. Defining two causal heuristics based on the number of extracted variables and length of causal chains to score the informativeness or "actionability" of user feedback. This can help prioritize useful feedback for engineers.

4. Evaluating the approach on real user feedback data from Microsoft's Feedback Hub and showing that it can uncover new issues beyond pre-classified ones, while minimizing out-of-domain responses.

In summary, the key contribution is using LLMs in an intelligent prompting framework to extract reliable causal insights from user feedback to construct causal graphs and score feedback utility.

The paper discusses leveraging Large Language Models and In-Context Learning to extract causal insights from user feedback data. It focuses on power and battery related feedback from the Microsoft Feedback Hub. The key ideas include using prompting techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting to elicit causal variables and event chains from the feedback. A self-consistency approach via prompt ensembles is proposed to reduce hallucination. The extracted insights are used to build causal graphs and define heuristics to score feedback informativeness. Overall, the paper demonstrates an application of LLMs for causal discovery from natural language data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the modified self-consistency framework proposed mitigate the issue of hallucination and incorrect answers from LLMs? What specific modifications were made compared to traditional self-consistency methods?

2. Why was an ensemble of prompts designed and leveraged for extracting causal variables and sequences? What are the key benefits this provides over using a single prompt?  

3. What greedy confounder selection approach is proposed and why may this lead to incorrect confounder selection? How can this issue be addressed in future work?

4. What are the key differences in the causal variables extracted via zero-shot vs few-shot chain of thought prompting? What accounts for these differences?

5. Why can the extracted causal variables and sequences help engineers prioritize and score feedback informativeness? What are the specifics of the two proposed heuristics?

6. What percentage of extracted outcomes/treatments were previously known vs newly discovered bugs? What does this suggest about the capability of the method? 

7. For the Modern Standby use case, what percentage of confounders were explicitly mentioned in the text vs inferred by the LLM? What enabled this emergent capability?  

8. For the extracted event sequences, what percentage were previously known vs newly discovered? Why is unearthing new event chains important?

9. What role does topic modeling and natural language inference play in the overall pipeline? How does it enable better causal analysis? 

10. What are some limitations of solely relying on user feedback for causal analysis vs supplementing with other data sources? How can the assumptions made be validated?
