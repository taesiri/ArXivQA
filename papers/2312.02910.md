# [Rare Galaxy Classes Identified In Foundation Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02910)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method to identify rare and visually distinctive galaxy populations by searching for structure within the learned representations of pretrained models. Specifically, the authors leverage the Zoobot galaxy foundation models (EfficientNetB0 and MaxViT Tiny architectures) that were pretrained on 100 million Galaxy Zoo volunteer responses to arrange galaxies by visual appearance independently of the original training labels. They design a clustering approach involving bottlenecking the models to 128 dimensions, compressing the representations with UMAP, and postprocessing the HDBSCAN clustering output to isolate local patterns corresponding to rare galaxy subclasses. Examples of subclasses identified include low-mass barred and unbarred galaxies, one-armed spirals, merging pairs, and galaxies with irregular clumpy structure. The discovery of these visually cohesive but rare groups, without any expert guidance, demonstrates that the foundation model representations contain meaningful structure beyond that needed for the original classification tasks. Overall, this unsupervised search technique provides a promising data-driven way to reveal new, unexpected galaxy populations that can shed light on the processes driving galaxy formation.
