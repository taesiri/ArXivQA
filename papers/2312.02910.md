# [Rare Galaxy Classes Identified In Foundation Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02910)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method to identify rare and visually distinctive galaxy populations by searching for structure within the learned representations of pretrained models. Specifically, the authors leverage the Zoobot galaxy foundation models (EfficientNetB0 and MaxViT Tiny architectures) that were pretrained on 100 million Galaxy Zoo volunteer responses to arrange galaxies by visual appearance independently of the original training labels. They design a clustering approach involving bottlenecking the models to 128 dimensions, compressing the representations with UMAP, and postprocessing the HDBSCAN clustering output to isolate local patterns corresponding to rare galaxy subclasses. Examples of subclasses identified include low-mass barred and unbarred galaxies, one-armed spirals, merging pairs, and galaxies with irregular clumpy structure. The discovery of these visually cohesive but rare groups, without any expert guidance, demonstrates that the foundation model representations contain meaningful structure beyond that needed for the original classification tasks. Overall, this unsupervised search technique provides a promising data-driven way to reveal new, unexpected galaxy populations that can shed light on the processes driving galaxy formation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method to identify rare and visually distinctive galaxy populations by searching for structure within the learned representations of pretrained models, showing that these representations arrange galaxies by appearance in patterns beyond those needed to predict the pretraining labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper seems to be:

Developing a method to identify rare and visually distinctive galaxy populations by searching for structure and patterns in the learned representations of pretrained galaxy models (like Zoobot). Specifically, the paper shows that Zoobot's representations arrange galaxies by visual appearance in ways beyond what is needed to predict the labels the model was pretrained on. By designing a clustering approach to isolate local patterns in the representation space, they are able to reveal groups of galaxies with rare and interesting morphologies.

In summary, the key contribution is using the inherent structure in a foundation model's learned representation to discover new subclasses of rare galaxies, without needing any examples of those subclasses a priori. This allows them to identify galaxies with distinctive features that may shed light on galaxy formation processes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Rare galaxy classes - The paper focuses on identifying visually rare and unusual galaxy populations.

- Foundation models - The paper utilizes the pretrained Zoobot galaxy models, referring to them as "foundation models" that have learned adaptable representations.

- Representation learning - A key aspect is searching for rare galaxies within the learned representations of the Zoobot models.

- Clustering - The paper applies dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to the representations to isolate rare galaxy subgroups. Specifically, it uses UMAP and HDBSCAN.

- Anomaly detection - The goal of finding rare galaxy types is related to anomaly detection, though the paper aims to find coherent subgroups rather than one-off anomalies.

- Galaxy morphology - The identified galaxy classes have distinct visual morphologies, like clumpy spirals, shredded spirals, one-armed spirals, etc.

- Data-driven discovery - A goal of the work is to data-mine the model representations to discover new galaxy populations in a data-driven way, without expert input.

So in summary, key terms revolve around representation learning, clustering, anomaly detection, and morphological analysis to uncover rare galaxy populations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that the representation learned by Zoobot arranges galaxies in patterns beyond those required to predict the supervised labels. What evidence is provided to support this claim? How definitive is this evidence? 

2. The method relies on finding overdensities in the compressed representation space to identify rare galaxy subclasses. What causes these overdensities? Could the overdensities be an artifact of the compression techniques rather than indicative of meaningful subgroups?

3. What motivates the specific parameter choices for the UMAP and HDBSCAN algorithms, such as the number of neighbors and minimum cluster size? How sensitive are the resulting clusters to these parameter settings? 

4. The paper notes that most galaxies (95%+) cannot be confidently assigned to clusters. What are some possible explanations for why the representation space is so resistant to clustering? How might the training process or compression techniques be altered to improve cluster detection?

5. How does the choice of architecture (EfficientNet vs MaxViT) impact the clusters identified? Are there meaningful differences between clusters found with each model? If so, what might account for these architectural differences?  

6. The paper identifies one cluster containing shredded spiral galaxies mistakenly recorded as multiple sources. What modifications could be made to the pipeline or method to automatically flag such cases in the future?

7. For the artifact clusters identified, what commonalities exist within each cluster in terms of the root cause or type of image contamination leading to those artifacts?

8. Some clusters, like the low-mass barred galaxies, have not been previously studied at scale. What follow-up analyses could be done on these clusters to better understand their properties and formation mechanisms?  

9. How do the clusters identified qualitatively or quantitatively compare to existing galaxy classification systems? Do any clusters align with known rare galaxy types or anomalies? 

10. The method currently identifies visually apparent clusters. How could the approach be extended to uncover more subtle galaxy subgroups that may not be visually distinctive but still share common intrinsic properties?
