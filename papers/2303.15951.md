# [F$^{2}$-NeRF: Fast Neural Radiance Field Training with Free Camera   Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15951)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new method called F$^2$-NeRF for fast training of neural radiance fields from images with free camera trajectories. 

The key research questions addressed in this paper are:

1) How to enable fast grid-based NeRF training methods to handle scenes captured with free, unstructured camera trajectories rather than just forward-facing or 360° trajectories?

2) How to optimize the allocation of the spatial representation capacity in grid-based NeRFs for long, narrow free trajectories where foreground objects have dense views but background regions are sparsely viewed?

3) Can a single warping function be designed that works for arbitrary free trajectories but also generalizes to forward-facing and 360° trajectories?

The central hypothesis is that by developing a novel perspective warping method and adaptive space subdivision strategy, it is possible to train high-quality NeRFs from free trajectories in just a few minutes on a single GPU. The perspective warping generalizes existing warping approaches and optimizes capacity allocation for free trajectories.

In summary, this paper aims to extend fast grid-based NeRF training to handle free camera trajectories through innovations in warping and space subdivision, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis from just a few minutes of training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel grid-based neural radiance field method called F2-NeRF for novel view synthesis. The key ideas and contributions are:

1. It proposes a general space warping method called perspective warping, which allows handling arbitrary camera trajectories in the grid-based NeRF framework. Previous grid-based NeRF methods rely on specialized space warping techniques like NDC warping or inverse sphere warping which only work for certain camera trajectories like forward-facing or 360 views. 

2. Based on the perspective warping, it further proposes adaptive space subdivision to allocate more grids and capacity to foreground regions. This allows efficiently using the limited GPU memory and representation capacity.

3. It validates the proposed F2-NeRF method on a new challenging dataset with free trajectories collected by the authors, demonstrating it can render high-quality novel views while only requiring around 12 minutes of training time on a single GPU.

4. Extensive experiments on Forward-Facing, 360, and Free trajectory datasets demonstrate the generality of the proposed perspective warping and that F2-NeRF outperforms previous state-of-the-art fast NeRF methods in terms of both quality and speed.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing perspective warping and F2-NeRF to enable fast, high-quality novel view synthesis from arbitrary camera trajectories using grid-based neural scene representations. The experiments validate effectiveness on diverse datasets including a new challenging free trajectory dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents F^2-NeRF, a novel grid-based neural radiance field method that enables fast training on scenes with arbitrary camera trajectories by using a perspective warping technique and adaptive spatial subdivision to efficiently represent unbounded scenes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in novel view synthesis with neural radiance fields:

- It focuses on enabling fast training of NeRFs on scenes with free, unstructured camera trajectories. Most prior work on fast NeRF training methods like Instant-NGP and DVGO targets more structured trajectories like forward-facing or 360 capture. The free trajectories posed a challenge for grid-based representations.

- It proposes a novel perspective warping method to handle the free trajectories in a unified way. This differs from prior work like mip-NeRF that uses separate warping methods for forward-facing vs 360 capture. The perspective warping generalizes across trajectory types.

- It combines the perspective warping method with a hash-based grid representation similar to Instant-NGP. Most prior fast NeRF methods use regular voxel grids. Using the hash-based grid allows scaling to large scenes. 

- It achieves training times under 15 minutes for high quality novel view synthesis. This is on par with or faster than recent fast NeRF methods. The speed comes from both the compact hash grid and optimizing the implementation in LibTorch.

- The method is evaluated on a new dataset of scenes with free trajectories captured by the authors. Most prior fast NeRF papers focus on standard datasets like LLFF and synthetic forward-facing/360 scenes.

In summary, the key novelties are in handling free trajectories efficiently via the perspective warping, and showing this can enable high quality novel view synthesis from unstructured camera paths in just a few minutes of training. This expands the applicability of fast NeRF methods to less constrained capture.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further improving the flexibility and generalization of F^2-NeRF to more complex camera trajectories and scenes. The current method still has some limitations in handling extremely complex free trajectories. Developing techniques to make F^2-NeRF applicable to more general trajectories could be an interesting direction. 

- Extending F^2-NeRF to large-scale scenes and trajectories by combining it with existing large-scale NeRF methods. The authors suggest F^2-NeRF could potentially serve as the backbone radiance field method for a single block in large-scale NeRF frameworks. Exploring this direction could allow high-quality novel view synthesis for large scenes with free trajectories.

- Developing new space subdivision and warping techniques to further improve sample efficiency and enable finer-grained capacity allocation. The perspective warping method provides a good start, but there is room for more optimized subdivision algorithms and more flexible warping functions.

- Applying F^2-NeRF to other tasks beyond novel view synthesis, such as relighting, dynamics modeling, etc. Exploring how free trajectories could benefit neural scene representations for other applications is a promising direction.

- Improving the efficiency of F^2-NeRF to achieve real-time performance. Reducing the training and rendering time could make F^2-NeRF more practical for real-world usages.

In summary, the main suggestions are to expand the applicability and flexibility of F^2-NeRF, integrate it into large-scale NeRF frameworks, further optimize the core techniques like space warping, and apply it to other tasks beyond view synthesis. Advancing research along these directions could lead to more powerful and generalizable neural radiance field methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents F$^2$-NeRF, a fast neural radiance field model that enables training from images captured along free, unbounded camera trajectories. The key ideas are:

1) A perspective warping method is proposed that can warp an unbounded 3D scene to a bounded space based on projecting scene points to their 2D locations in input camera views. This allows handling arbitrary camera trajectories unlike previous warping methods like NDC or sphere inversion. 

2) The scene is adaptively subdivided so that local warping functions can be constructed for different regions based on visible cameras. This allows allocating representation capacity based on scene complexity.

3) Features are stored in a shared hash table indexed using different hash functions for different regions. This reduces collisions while enabling memory efficiency.

4) A perspective sampling method is used to sample points along camera rays based on warping derivatives. This gives more uniform image space sampling.

Together, these ideas allow F$^2$-NeRF to be trained from free trajectories in a few minutes while giving higher quality results than previous fast NeRF methods like Instant-NGP or DVGO. Experiments on forward-facing, 360, and free trajectory datasets demonstrate fast, high-quality novel view synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a novel grid-based neural radiance field method called F2-NeRF for novel view synthesis. F2-NeRF enables fast training of neural radiance fields from arbitrary camera trajectories in just a few minutes. Existing grid-based methods like Instant-NGP and DVGO are limited to bounded scenes or require special camera trajectories like forward-facing or 360 surround views. The key contribution of this work is a new space warping method called perspective warping that can handle novel view synthesis from arbitrary camera trajectories. 

The perspective warping method represents a 3D point using the 2D coordinates of its projection in the input views. These 2D coordinates are mapped to a compact 3D subspace using PCA. This allows converting an unbounded scene to a bounded representation. The scene is adaptively subdivided so that foreground regions use finer grids and background regions use coarser grids. Experiments on unbounded forward-facing scenes, 360 surround view scenes, and a new dataset with long, narrow free trajectories show that F2-NeRF produces high quality novel views in just 12 minutes of training. The same perspective warping method works for all camera trajectories. F2-NeRF outperforms prior grid-based methods like Instant-NGP on the challenging free trajectory scenes.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents F$^2$-NeRF, a novel grid-based neural radiance field method for novel view synthesis that enables training on scenes with arbitrary camera trajectories in just a few minutes. F$^2$-NeRF uses a new perspective warping technique to map the unbounded scene to a bounded space compatible with grid representations. The key idea is to represent a 3D point's location using the concatenation of its 2D projected coordinates in the input views, and then map these to 3D using PCA. This allows handling of arbitrary camera trajectories. F$^2$-NeRF also uses a space subdivision scheme to allocate more grids to focused foreground regions based on camera view frustums, improving efficiency. The same perspective warping and grid representation is used across diverse datasets with different camera trajectories. Experiments show F$^2$-NeRF can render high-quality views of unbounded scenes from new camera poses after only around 12 minutes of training, outperforming prior grid-based NeRF methods on a challenging dataset with long, narrow camera trajectories.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- Existing fast grid-based NeRF training methods (e.g. Instant-NGP, Plenoxels, DVGO, TensoRF) are designed for bounded scenes and rely on space warping to handle unbounded scenes. 

- There are two main space warping methods used currently - NDC warping for forward-facing scenes, and inverse sphere warping for 360° object-centric scenes. However, these warping methods assume specific camera trajectory patterns and cannot handle arbitrary camera trajectories.

- In particular, they have difficulty handling long, narrow camera trajectories with multiple foreground objects ("free trajectories"), leading to poor rendering quality. 

- The key questions are: How to enable fast grid-based NeRF training on unbounded scenes with arbitrary camera trajectories? How to handle free trajectories efficiently?

In summary, the main problem is that existing fast NeRF methods and space warping techniques are limited to specific camera trajectory patterns and cannot handle arbitrary free trajectories for large unbounded scenes. The paper aims to address this limitation by proposing a novel space warping method and fast NeRF framework that can accommodate arbitrary camera trajectories.
