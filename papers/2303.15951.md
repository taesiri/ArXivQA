# [F$^{2}$-NeRF: Fast Neural Radiance Field Training with Free Camera   Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15951)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper presents a new method called F$^2$-NeRF for fast training of neural radiance fields from images with free camera trajectories. The key research questions addressed in this paper are:1) How to enable fast grid-based NeRF training methods to handle scenes captured with free, unstructured camera trajectories rather than just forward-facing or 360° trajectories?2) How to optimize the allocation of the spatial representation capacity in grid-based NeRFs for long, narrow free trajectories where foreground objects have dense views but background regions are sparsely viewed?3) Can a single warping function be designed that works for arbitrary free trajectories but also generalizes to forward-facing and 360° trajectories?The central hypothesis is that by developing a novel perspective warping method and adaptive space subdivision strategy, it is possible to train high-quality NeRFs from free trajectories in just a few minutes on a single GPU. The perspective warping generalizes existing warping approaches and optimizes capacity allocation for free trajectories.In summary, this paper aims to extend fast grid-based NeRF training to handle free camera trajectories through innovations in warping and space subdivision, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis from just a few minutes of training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel grid-based neural radiance field method called F2-NeRF for novel view synthesis. The key ideas and contributions are:1. It proposes a general space warping method called perspective warping, which allows handling arbitrary camera trajectories in the grid-based NeRF framework. Previous grid-based NeRF methods rely on specialized space warping techniques like NDC warping or inverse sphere warping which only work for certain camera trajectories like forward-facing or 360 views. 2. Based on the perspective warping, it further proposes adaptive space subdivision to allocate more grids and capacity to foreground regions. This allows efficiently using the limited GPU memory and representation capacity.3. It validates the proposed F2-NeRF method on a new challenging dataset with free trajectories collected by the authors, demonstrating it can render high-quality novel views while only requiring around 12 minutes of training time on a single GPU.4. Extensive experiments on Forward-Facing, 360, and Free trajectory datasets demonstrate the generality of the proposed perspective warping and that F2-NeRF outperforms previous state-of-the-art fast NeRF methods in terms of both quality and speed.In summary, the key contribution is proposing perspective warping and F2-NeRF to enable fast, high-quality novel view synthesis from arbitrary camera trajectories using grid-based neural scene representations. The experiments validate effectiveness on diverse datasets including a new challenging free trajectory dataset.
