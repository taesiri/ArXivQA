# [Conditional Score-Based Diffusion Model for Cortical Thickness   Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves progressive decline in cognitive functions and irreversible brain atrophy. Changes in cortical thickness (CTh) are closely associated with AD progression. 
- Accurately forecasting CTh trajectories can aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD. 
- Existing longitudinal data suffers from temporal sparsity and missing data, posing challenges in modeling disease progression.
- Existing methods either focus on complete data or require assumptions about disease trajectories.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a conditional score-based diffusion model to generate CTh trajectories based on baseline information like diagnosis, age, sex etc.

- The model utilizes a forward diffusion process that adds noise to the conditional data distribution. The reverse process generates samples from the original data distribution.

- The reverse diffusion process uses a trained neural network (denoising U-Net) to estimate the score function. This guides the model in adjusting the data to match the training distribution.

- The model is trained on incomplete longitudinal CTh data from the TADPOLE dataset. During inference, it predicts CTh changes from baseline data without needing historical CTh measurements.

Main Contributions:
- First application of diffusion models for longitudinal CTh prediction in Alzheimer's disease.

- Model conditioned on multifaceted baseline information to capture diverse cortical thinning patterns.

- Evaluated on population, subgroup and patient levels. Shows negligible bias and strong correlation to ground truth measurements.

- Enables continuous and flexible CTh predictions based on time differences. 

- Provides uncertainty analysis for patient-specific forecasts through multiple stochastic realizations.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel conditional score-based diffusion model for cortical thickness prediction in Alzheimer's disease that shows strong performance across groups and can quantify uncertainty in patient-specific forecasts.
