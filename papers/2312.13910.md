# [Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for   Connected Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of decision-making for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, it aims to address two challenges: (1) Existing model-free RL methods for CAVs require a huge amount of training data which is infeasible to collect in practice. (2) Most studies only consider decision making for a single CAV, ignoring vehicle-to-vehicle communications.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel decentralized multi-agent model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called MA-PETS. The key ideas are:

1) Use probabilistic ensemble neural networks to learn the environment dynamics model from data exchanged between neighboring vehicles. This captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. 

2) Develop a trajectory sampling based model predictive control method for decision making using the learned model. This avoids expensive computations and is robust to uncertainty.

3) Analyze the group regret bound theoretically to show that communication between agents reduces the regret, even in the worst case of uniformly random exploration.

Main Contributions:

1) A decentralized multi-agent model-based RL algorithm MA-PETS for CAV decision making, which uses probabilistic ensembling and trajectory sampling.

2) Mathematical analysis to derive the group regret bound, formally proving that communication helps reduce regret. 

3) Extensive simulations using a CAV platform SMARTS showing MA-PETS converges much faster than state-of-the-art multi-agent RL algorithms.

4) Investigation of impact of communication range on learning efficiency and safety of MA-PETS. Results validate the theoretical group regret analyses.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in addressing key challenges of applying multi-agent RL for CAV decision making via a sample-efficient model-based approach and formally analyzing the benefits of communications.
