# [Towards Large-scale Network Emulation on Analog Neuromorphic Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neuromorphic hardware like the BrainScaleS-2 (BSS-2) system has limited size and cannot directly emulate larger spiking neural networks (SNNs) that exceed the chip's constraints. This restricts the complexity of models that can be tested.

- There is a need for techniques to map larger SNN models onto the BSS-2 system to enable more accurate performance evaluation and aid development of large-scale models and architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents software support to facilitate emulation of partitioned large-scale SNNs on BSS-2 by splitting them into subnetworks that individually fit into the hardware constraints. 

- Subnetworks are executed sequentially, with spikes recorded and injected between runs to retain communication. This allows reusing neuron/synapse substrates across the partitions.

- Two models (MNIST, EuroSAT) exceeding BSS-2 size constraints are demonstrated by partitioning feedforward paths and small recurrent subnetworks to fit sequentially.

Main Contributions:

- Novel software feature enabling large SNN emulation on BSS-2 substrates via automated partitioning and sequential execution.

- Abstraction to shift focus from hardware handling to modeling larger networks.

- First demonstration of training and inference for MNIST ($98\%$ accuracy) and EuroSAT SNNs larger than BSS-2 constraints. 

- Showcases how partitioning can extend capabilities of small neuromorphic systems to evaluate larger models, aiding future hardware development.

In summary, the key innovation is software support to sequentially map partitioned subnetworks of large SNN models onto the limited BSS-2 hardware by reusing substrates across runs. This enables exploring SNNs at scales beyond the constraints of current small neuromorphic chips.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a software framework that enables the emulation of large-scale spiking neural networks on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic hardware by automatically partitioning models into subnetworks that fit within the hardware's size constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel software feature for the BrainScaleS-2 (BSS-2) neuromorphic platform that facilitates the emulation of partitioned large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs). This allows networks larger than the physical size constraints of a single BSS-2 chip to be trained and tested by partitioning them into subnetworks that fit onto the hardware. The authors demonstrate this on MNIST and EuroSAT image classification tasks, training networks too large to fit on a single BSS-2 chip by partitioning them and reusing neuron/synapse circuits multiple times across sequential executions of the partitions. The ability to emulate bigger-than-substrate SNNs provides a pathway for more accurate performance evaluation and advances the development and understanding of large-scale models and neuromorphic computing architectures.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Neuromorphic hardware - The paper focuses on utilizing the BrainScaleS-2 (BSS-2) neuromorphic hardware as a substrate for emulating spiking neural networks.

- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) - The models trained and tested in the paper are spiking neural networks, which incorporate more biologically realistic spiking dynamics.

- Network partitioning - A key contribution is software support for partitioning large SNN models into subnetworks that can fit within the hardware constraints of a single BSS-2 chip.

- Sequential execution - The partitions of a large SNN are executed sequentially on the hardware by reusing neuron/synapse circuits. This allows emulation of networks larger than the hardware substrate.

- MNIST dataset - A standard image classification dataset used to demonstrate the partitioning approach and achieve 98% accuracy on BSS-2, the best reported so far.

- EuroSAT dataset - A satellite image land use/land cover dataset, used to showcase emulation of the largest SNN on BSS-2 to date by partitioning the network across multiple executions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a software feature to facilitate the emulation of partitioned large-scale spiking neural networks on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic hardware. Can you explain in more detail how this software feature works to enable the partitioning and sequential execution? 

2. The method relies on splitting up networks into subnetworks that fit onto the single-chip BrainScaleS-2 system. What are the constraints and trade-offs involved when determining how to partition a larger network appropriately?

3. The results showcase emulating the largest spiking neural network to date on BrainScaleS-2. Can you discuss the approach taken to map the large 12288-dimensional input space of the EuroSAT dataset onto the hardware?

4. The paper notes a performance gap between simulation and emulation on BrainScaleS-2 for the EuroSAT task. What are some potential reasons for this performance degradation that are mentioned? How might these be addressed in future work?

5. Partitioned emulation will typically be slower than a sufficiently large hardware system. However, the paper argues there is still value in this approach during hardware development cycles. Can you expand on the key benefits highlighted for being able to explore larger networks, despite slower performance?  

6. The method relies on the mixed-signal nature of BrainScaleS-2 where spike communication between subnetworks can be reliably recorded and replayed. How does this mixed-signal approach enable deterministic communication during partitioning?

7. Can you discuss in more technical detail how the software API and backend signal-flow graph notation can represent partitioned networks across multiple executions? 

8. The EuroSAT results are the first benchmarking of BrainScaleS-2 hardware for a satellite image processing task. What is the potential relevance of this for future applications that is noted?

9. The paper mentions connectivity sparsity enabled mapping receptive fields for the EuroSAT input layer. How does leveraging sparsity help enable partitioning schemes in neuromorphic hardware?

10. Can you suggest any alternative partitioning or mapping schemes that could be explored beyond the specific approach taken in this paper for Feedforward and Convolutional SNN topologies?
