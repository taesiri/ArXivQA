# [To Err Is Human, but Llamas Can Learn It Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to automatically correct errors in text, but suffers from lack of training data even for high-resource languages.  
- Artificial error generation (AEG) is commonly used to create synthetic training data by introducing errors into clean text. But most methods are simple rule-based approaches and don't generate errors similar to human errors.

Proposed Solution:
- Fine-tune language models (LMs) based on Llama 2 architecture to perform AEG by taking clean text as input and generating text with errors as output.
- Show that errors generated by fine-tuned LMs are more diverse and human-like compared to rule-based methods. 
- Use the synthetic data from LM-based AEG to train GEC models, also based on Llama 2 LMs.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate that pre-trained LMs can be effectively fine-tuned for high-quality AEG with limited human error data.
- The synthetic errors enhance GEC models more than rule-based errors, with gains of 2-2.4 F0.5 score.  
- Achieve new state-of-the-art GEC results across German, Ukrainian and Estonian by training Llama 2 models on synthetic data from LM-based AEG.
- Compare fine-tuning LMs for AEG to prompting large models like GPT-3.5 and show both can generate useful errors.
- Analyze quality of errors from different AEG methods and show LM-based errors are more similar to human errors than rule-based methods.
