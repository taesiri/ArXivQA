# [Attentive Illumination Decomposition Model for Multi-Illuminant White   Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing white balance (WB) algorithms assume uniform illumination, failing for multi-illuminant scenes. 
- Prior multi-illuminant WB works predict pixel-level illumination without considering scene's lighting conditions (number and color of lights). This leads to unnatural results lacking consistency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Attentive Illumination Decomposition (AID), a deep WB model leveraging slot attention to represent individual illuminants.
- AID estimates chromaticities and weight maps for each illuminant which are fused to generate the final illumination map. This satisfies the image formation model's linearity constraint.

Key Components:
- Slot Attention Module: Slots represent chromaticities of illuminants. Attention maps become pixel-wise weight maps of corresponding illuminants.
- Centroid Matching Loss: Matches predictions to ground truths based on color gamut to enhance decomposition.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to separately predict chromaticity and weight map of each illuminant for multi-illuminant WB.
- Novel centroid matching loss for effective slot updates to represent color gamuts. 
- State-of-the-art performance on both single- and multi-illuminant datasets. Provides illuminant-wise information allowing tuning of illumination.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable illumination decomposition framework for multi-illuminant white balance. By leveraging slot attention and a new loss, it demonstrates superior quantitative results while offering additional control over scene illumination.
