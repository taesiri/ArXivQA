# [Distilled ChatGPT Topic &amp; Sentiment Modeling with Applications in   Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quarterly earnings calls provide valuable insights for investors, but analyzing large numbers of transcripts is labor intensive. 
- Conventional topic modeling has limitations in handling noise and flexibility.
- Large language models (LLMs) can analyze earnings calls effectively but have issues like computational demands, reproducibility, explainability.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a 3-step knowledge distillation pipeline to create lightweight topic and sentiment classification models from a large LLM teacher model.
- Step 1) Use ChatGPT to suggest topics based on a sample of sentences from earnings transcripts. Refine list with expert input.  
- Step 2) Query ChatGPT to label a dataset of 80,000 sentences with topics from refined list.
- Step 3) Train a smaller MPNet model on labeled data using transfer learning. Add MLP for classification.

- Repeat step 2 to create labeled data for sentiment classification. Transfer learn from FinBERT teacher model.

Main Contributions:
- Method to distill knowledge from ChatGPT into simplified finance models with high accuracy.
- Achieve topic model F1 of 73% and sentiment model F1 of 78% vs human labels. 
- Demonstrate applications like analyzing topic/sentiment correlation with stock returns and tracking sentiment trends.
- Computationally lighter method more suitable for industry applications compared to heavy LLMs.

In summary, the paper presents a novel knowledge distillation pipeline to create accurate and interpretable topic and sentiment classifiers for earnings transcripts using ChatGPT and transfer learning. Key applications in quantitative finance are demonstrated.
