# [Semi-supervised Semantics-guided Adversarial Training for Trajectory   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14230)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research focus is developing a new adversarial training method to enhance the robustness and robust generalization of trajectory prediction models against adversarial attacks. 

Specifically, the central hypothesis appears to be:

A novel adversarial training approach based on a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder architecture with disentangled semantic features can effectively improve the adversarial robustness and generalization of trajectory prediction models.

The key elements of their proposed method include:

- Using a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to model disentangled semantic features (e.g. lateral and longitudinal vectors) in the latent space. 

- Incorporating domain knowledge to impose useful priors on the distributions of semantic latent vectors.

- Providing additional latent labels to guide the adversarial training process.

- Modeling attack patterns explicitly through the semantic features.

- Balancing robustness and standard accuracy trade-off via techniques like MixUp.

Through extensive experiments, the paper aims to demonstrate that this semantics-guided architecture and adversarial training pipeline can enhance robustness against various types of attacks and improve generalization to unseen attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper outlines LaTeX author guidelines for submitting a paper to the IEEE Computer Society Press for the ICCV conference proceedings. The main contributions are:

- It provides instructions on paper formatting, such as using a two-column format, font sizes, margins, and page numbering. 

- It gives guidelines on language, paper length, and the use of a ruler in the submission.

- It offers recommendations on mathematics, figures, tables, references, footnotes, headings, and other stylistic matters. 

- It specifies requirements for blind review, anonymizing citations, acknowledging previous work, and citing the authors' own technical reports or challenge submissions.

- It describes how to handle situations where the work relies on access restricted to a single institution.

- It notes the requirement to submit a signed IEEE copyright release form.

So in summary, this paper aims to provide a set of comprehensive author instructions to facilitate the preparation and submission of manuscripts for the ICCV conference proceedings. The guidelines cover both the formatting aspects as well as the policies and stylistic considerations.
