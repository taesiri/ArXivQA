## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel adversarial training method to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models against adversarial attacks. The key ideas are:

1) They develop a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder (AAE) architecture that models disentangled semantic features (lateral and longitudinal) in the latent space. This is guided by domain knowledge of typical trajectory distributions. The semi-supervised learning provides additional latent labels to facilitate adversarial training when ground truths are available. 

2) They conduct adversarial training on the attacked trajectories to improve robustness. Compared to typical adversarial training that only uses the final trajectory error, they exploit the semantic latent vectors predicted by the AAE and put higher weight on the semi-supervised loss when the attack fools the lateral intention prediction. This guides the model to focus more on high-level semantics when under attacks.

3) Extensive experiments show their proposed method, named SSAT, outperforms other defense baselines by reducing the prediction errors under attacks by up to 73%. It also demonstrates better generalization on unseen types of attacks. This verifies the benefits of modeling disentangled semantics and semi-supervised learning in the adversarial training process.

In summary, the key novelty is developing a semi-supervised AAE architecture to model semantic latent features and trajectories, which facilitates more effective adversarial training for robust trajectory prediction.
