# [Semi-supervised Semantics-guided Adversarial Training for Trajectory   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14230)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research focus is developing a new adversarial training method to enhance the robustness and robust generalization of trajectory prediction models against adversarial attacks. 

Specifically, the central hypothesis appears to be:

A novel adversarial training approach based on a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder architecture with disentangled semantic features can effectively improve the adversarial robustness and generalization of trajectory prediction models.

The key elements of their proposed method include:

- Using a semi-supervised adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to model disentangled semantic features (e.g. lateral and longitudinal vectors) in the latent space. 

- Incorporating domain knowledge to impose useful priors on the distributions of semantic latent vectors.

- Providing additional latent labels to guide the adversarial training process.

- Modeling attack patterns explicitly through the semantic features.

- Balancing robustness and standard accuracy trade-off via techniques like MixUp.

Through extensive experiments, the paper aims to demonstrate that this semantics-guided architecture and adversarial training pipeline can enhance robustness against various types of attacks and improve generalization to unseen attacks.
