# [Monitoring the evolution of antisemitic discourse on extremist social   media using BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05548)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hate speech and conspiracy theories are rampant on social media platforms, contributing to a toxic online environment. Specifically, antisemitism is spreading and evolving, with new conspiracy theories and terminology emerging continuously. 
- Manual monitoring of this evolution is impractical due to the large volume of posts. Existing methods for analyzing online hate speech take a static view rather than dynamically tracking the evolution of themes and terminology over time.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an unsupervised online machine learning approach to continuously monitor and track the evolution of antisemitic themes and associated terminology in extremist posts on social media.
- They use transformer-based language models (BERT) to generate semantic embeddings that capture the contextual meaning of posts. These embeddings are input into a novel divisive clustering algorithm that adaptively updates clustering over time as new posts come in.
- The approach works in a continual fashion, ensuring stability and avoiding catastrophic forgetting as new information is incorporated. It makes local or global updates to existing clusters. New subthemes can emerge from existing clusters, and new clusters form when sufficiently distinct new themes arise.

Main Contributions:
- A continually running unsupervised approach to track evolution of antisemitic discourse and terminology over time from social media posts.
- A novel stable divisive clustering algorithm tailored for this task that makes local or global updates, capturing new subthemes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
- Demonstrating the methodology extracts meaningful antisemitic themes like economic control, political control, cultural control, dystopian conspiracy theories etc. and related terminology.
- Analysis shows the approach outperforms existing baseline methods for clustering/topic modeling and has unique capabilities for dynamically monitoring evolving themes.

In summary, the key innovation is a continuously running unsupervised system that can track emerging trends in antisemitic conspiracy theories and terminology on social media by clustering posts into themes and making stable updates over time. This provides a valuable tool for monitoring the evolution of online hatred.
