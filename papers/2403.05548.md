# [Monitoring the evolution of antisemitic discourse on extremist social   media using BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05548)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hate speech and conspiracy theories are rampant on social media platforms, contributing to a toxic online environment. Specifically, antisemitism is spreading and evolving, with new conspiracy theories and terminology emerging continuously. 
- Manual monitoring of this evolution is impractical due to the large volume of posts. Existing methods for analyzing online hate speech take a static view rather than dynamically tracking the evolution of themes and terminology over time.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an unsupervised online machine learning approach to continuously monitor and track the evolution of antisemitic themes and associated terminology in extremist posts on social media.
- They use transformer-based language models (BERT) to generate semantic embeddings that capture the contextual meaning of posts. These embeddings are input into a novel divisive clustering algorithm that adaptively updates clustering over time as new posts come in.
- The approach works in a continual fashion, ensuring stability and avoiding catastrophic forgetting as new information is incorporated. It makes local or global updates to existing clusters. New subthemes can emerge from existing clusters, and new clusters form when sufficiently distinct new themes arise.

Main Contributions:
- A continually running unsupervised approach to track evolution of antisemitic discourse and terminology over time from social media posts.
- A novel stable divisive clustering algorithm tailored for this task that makes local or global updates, capturing new subthemes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
- Demonstrating the methodology extracts meaningful antisemitic themes like economic control, political control, cultural control, dystopian conspiracy theories etc. and related terminology.
- Analysis shows the approach outperforms existing baseline methods for clustering/topic modeling and has unique capabilities for dynamically monitoring evolving themes.

In summary, the key innovation is a continuously running unsupervised system that can track emerging trends in antisemitic conspiracy theories and terminology on social media by clustering posts into themes and making stable updates over time. This provides a valuable tool for monitoring the evolution of online hatred.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised online machine learning approach using transformer models like BERT to continuously monitor the evolution of antisemitic themes and associated terminology in extremist social media discussions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an unsupervised machine learning approach for continuously monitoring the evolution of antisemitic discourse and themes in online extremist communities. Specifically:

1) The paper presents an algorithm that takes in batches of social media posts over time, clusters them into antisemitic themes, and extracts related terminology. As new posts come in, the algorithm adaptively updates the clustering to add new themes or sub-themes that emerge, without catastrophically forgetting past knowledge.

2) The algorithm uses transformer-based language models (specifically BERT) to generate semantic embeddings of the posts, which help uncover conceptual relationships for clustering. The clusters represent different antisemitic themes or tropes found in the data.

3) The paper demonstrates and evaluates the approach both quantitatively and qualitatively on a dataset of extremist posts. It shows the algorithm can effectively capture emerging and evolving antisemitic themes and terminology over time. 

In summary, the main contribution is developing a continually running, unsupervised system to track hateful discourse as it changes on social platforms. The system extracts the themes and terminology it contains to help understand extremist communities. This approach is designed to assist organizations seeking to monitor and intervene against online hatred.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Antisemitism
- Hate speech
- Online monitoring
- Concept formation
- Large language models (LLMs)
- BERT
- Transformer architecture
- Unsupervised learning
- Continual learning
- Concept drift
- Extremist social media
- Trope discovery
- Term extraction

The paper focuses on using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to monitor the evolution of antisemitic discourse and themes on extremist social media platforms. Some of the key technical elements include using BERT, a type of large language model based on the transformer architecture, to generate contextualized embeddings of social media posts. These embeddings are then clustered in an unsupervised, online fashion to discover antisemitic tropes and themes and track them over time. New terms associated with emerging tropes are also extracted automatically. The overall approach aims to provide a continual monitoring system for tracking hateful content on social platforms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using BERT for generating contextual embeddings. What were some of the different combinations explored for extracting contextual embeddings from BERT (e.g. last 4 layers, pooled layer)? What were the results of evaluating these different combinations?

2. Algorithm 1 outlines the approach for continuously extracting antisemitic concepts over time. Walk through the details of how local and global adjustments work to update the concepts. What is the purpose of only allowing these two types of adjustments?

3. Explain the semantic similarity structure maintained in Algorithm 1. What is the purpose of storing root and child concepts in this structure? How does this help in tracking the evolution of concepts over time?

4. The paper evaluates both quantitatively and qualitatively. Discuss the quantitative results comparing the proposed approach to baselines like Affinity Propagation, Birch, Spectral Clustering etc. What metrics were used and how did the approach perform?

5. Pick one of the qualitative concepts discussed in Section 4.2 (e.g. C2, C5 etc.) and analyze the key terms and themes associated with that concept. How do they relate to known antisemitic tropes or conspiracy theories?  

6. Discuss the detailed quantitative analysis done in Section 4.3 focusing on concepts C2 and C7. How does coverage by the proposed approach for these concepts compare to the baselines? What does this analysis reveal about the quality of the clustering?

7. The paper mentions the ability to extract emerging hate terminology from the discovered concepts. Briefly explain the methodology used for term extraction and how cosine similarity with known terms is used to automatically evaluate new terms.

8. What are some of the benefits of using lifelong unsupervised learning instead of supervised learning for a problem like evolving hate speech monitoring? Why is catastrophic forgetting an issue and how does the approach address it?

9. The paper focuses specifically on antisemitism but mentions applicability to other types of hatred discourse as well. What modifications would be needed to apply the same methodology to monitor evolution of themes around racism, homophobia etc?

10. What are some ways the researchers suggest to make the approach more user-friendly and tailored to the needs of social scientists studying online hate? What kind of additional features could be built on top of the concept mapping methodology?
