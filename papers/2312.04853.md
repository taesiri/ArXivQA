# [DiffCMR: Fast Cardiac MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion Probabilistic   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04853)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DiffCMR, a novel MRI reconstruction framework that leverages conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models to generate high-quality MRI images from under-sampled k-space data. The method views MRI reconstruction as a conditional image generation task, where the model takes the under-sampled MRI image as conditioning and outputs the corresponding fully-sampled image. Specifically, DiffCMR employs a U-Net-based model with concatenated encodings of the under-sampled input and current estimate to perform iterative denoising over multiple diffusion steps. To further enhance performance, the authors adopt a multi-round inference strategy that averages results across different passes. Experiments conducted on the CMRxRecon dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with DiffCMR significantly outperforming previous methods like U-Net and cGAN in terms of metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE. The proposed framework offers a robust and effective approach to accelerated MRI reconstruction that generates high-fidelity outputs while requiring less sampling.
