# [Unveiling the Truth and Facilitating Change: Towards Agent-based   Large-scale Social Movement Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Simulating large-scale online social movements on social media platforms like Twitter is important to anticipate their potential real-world impact. 
- Existing agent-based models (ABMs) have limitations in accurately and efficiently capturing complex behaviors of participants. Using multiple large language models (LLMs) is infeasible due to high computational costs.

Proposed Solution:
- A hybrid simulation framework with two types of users - core users and ordinary users. 
- Core users (influential, active) are modeled by LLMs to emulate complex behaviors. Ordinary users are modeled by computationally cheaper ABMs.
- An online environment similar to Twitter is built for user interactions. Proposed a benchmark SoMoSiMu-Bench with real-world social movement datasets and micro/macro evaluation methods.

Key Contributions:
- Novel hybrid framework combining strengths of LLMs and ABMs for simulating massive participants in social media.
- Tailored simulator platform for modeling opinion dynamics of users in online social movements.
- First benchmark SoMoSiMu-Bench for evaluating social movement simulations, with real-world Twitter datasets.
- Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the hybrid framework over pure ABMs in aligning with real user behaviors and matching empirical attitude distributions.

In summary, the paper introduces a hybrid LLM-ABM based approach to address challenges in simulating large-scale online social movements. A specialized simulation platform and benchmark are designed to facilitate and evaluate the simulations. Experiments verify improved alignment with real-world observations over pure ABM-based methods.
