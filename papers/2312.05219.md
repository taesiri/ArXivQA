## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel facial analysis approach that integrates 3D facial models with deep learning for enhanced classification and recognition. The key innovation is using parameters from 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) reconstruction, specifically the shape coefficient (alpha) and expression coefficient (beta), as inputs to train a ResNet-34 model. A robust reconstruction method called weakly-supervised neural aggregation is used to obtain accurate 3DMM parameters from multiple 2D images. The alpha and beta coefficients are found to encode richer facial information compared to original images. Classification experiments on facial recognition, gender classification, and expression classification yield significantly higher accuracy when using 3DMM coefficients over images, achieving 100%, 95.4%, and 83.5% respectively. Additionally, training time is reduced by up to 62 times. The method's effectiveness stems from systematic extraction of salient shape and expression features that ResNet leverages to improve classification performance. By combining 3D facial insights with deep learning, the paper demonstrates enhanced facial analysis with versatility across tasks and datasets. The approach holds promise for advancing facial classification research.
