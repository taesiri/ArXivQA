# [SAWEC: Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Emerging mobile VR systems require continuous execution of complex computer vision algorithms like object detection and segmentation on high-resolution video frames. 
- However, mobile VR headsets lack enough computational capability to run complex deep neural networks (DNNs) on high-resolution frames.
- While wireless edge computing (WEC) can help by offloading computation to the edge server, continuously transmitting high-resolution frames requires very high data rates which exceed wireless network capacity. 
- Existing WEC methods that compress or downsize frames degrade DNN performance significantly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing" (SAWEC), a new WEC paradigm.
- SAWEC leverages Wi-Fi-based sensing integrated with communication to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in video frames.
- It localizes and tracks humans/objects using angle of arrival/time of arrival estimated from channel frequency response.
- Only the detected ROI from high-res frames, instead of full frames, are transmitted to edge server for DNN execution.

Key Contributions:
- A Wi-Fi sensing based framework to identify ROIs inside 360-degree video frames before transmitting to edge server.
- ADBSCAN-based tracking approach tailored for high localization resolution using 160 MHz Wi-Fi.  
- Adaptation algorithm to map the sensed localization information onto 360-degree camera coordinate system.
- Extensive experiments in anechoic chamber & hall room with 360-degree 10K resolution camera, Wi-Fi 6 network.
- Reduces channel usage and end-to-end latency by 93.81% and 96.19% respectively over state-of-the-art WEC methods. 
- Improves instance segmentation MAP 50-95 by 46.98% compared to baseline WEC methods.

In summary, the key novelty of SAWEC lies in utilizing Wi-Fi sensing to assist wireless edge computing by detecting ROIs inside high-resolution 360-degree video frames before transmission. This markedly reduces resource usage while improving DNN performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a sensing-assisted wireless edge computing framework called SAWEC that leverages Wi-Fi-based localization and tracking to detect regions of interest in 360-degree video frames and only transmits those regions to the edge server for processing, significantly reducing bandwidth usage, end-to-end latency, and improving task performance compared to traditional approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm called "Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing" (SAWEC). SAWEC leverages wireless sensing integrated with the communication process to identify regions of interest (ROIs) in video frames captured by a 360-degree camera. Instead of transmitting the full high-resolution video frames which would require excessive bandwidth, SAWEC transmits only the ROIs to the edge server for processing. This reduces bandwidth usage and end-to-end latency while still allowing complex computer vision algorithms to operate on high-resolution ROIs instead of downsized/compressed frames. The paper presents the design of SAWEC, including Wi-Fi-based localization and tracking to detect ROIs, adaptation of the sensed data to the camera's frame of reference, ROI detection, and experimental evaluation showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.

The key innovation is using concurrent wireless sensing during communication to optimize edge computing through selective ROI transmission, rather than transmitting full frames. This saves network resources without sacrificing image resolution for the computer vision task.

- Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)/channel frequency response (CFR) - Used for wireless sensing and localization to detect ROIs. 

- Localization and tracking - Wireless sensing techniques used to obtain location information about targets/humans to determine ROIs.

- 360-degree video frames - High resolution (e.g. 10K) 360-degree video captured by VR headset cameras, processed using edge computing.

- Deep neural networks (DNNs) - Complex models like instance segmentation models executed on the edge server to process ROIs from the VR headset camera.

So in summary, keywords focus on wireless sensing assisted edge computing for 360 VR video processing using ROI detection and DNN execution.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a sensing-assisted wireless edge computing (SAWEC) framework. Can you elaborate on how the wireless sensing component provides useful contextual information to guide the ROI detection? What specific wireless sensing techniques are leveraged? 

2. The paper mentions using DBSCAN for clustering the angle of arrival (AoA) and time of arrival (ToA) estimates. What considerations went into selecting DBSCAN over other clustering algorithms? How are the DBSCAN parameters (e.g. epsilon, minimum samples) selected?

3. The ROI multiplying factor alpha is introduced to account for localization error when determining the ROI size. How was an appropriate value of alpha determined through experimentation? What is the tradeoff between segmentation performance and channel occupation when varying alpha?

4. The paper performs an AoA/ToA adaptation to project estimates into the camera's reference frame. Can you walk through the geometric transformations and assumptions made in the adaptation process? How robust is this to small variations in camera/WiFi node positions?  

5. What considerations need to be made in terms of synchronizing the WiFi sensing measurements and video frames? How might performance degrade if synchronization is imperfect?

6. How does SAWEC performance compare when using different numbers of receiver antennas for the WiFi sensing? What limits the localization resolution that can be achieved?

7. The paper evaluates SAWEC for the computer vision task of instance segmentation. How might performance differ for other vision tasks like object detection, image classification, etc?

8. Can you discuss the expected limitations of SAWEC in highly dynamic environments with many moving objects? When would the ROI detection likely fail?

9. What future work could be done to enhance the localization and tracking capabilities of SAWEC to make it more robust? Are there other sensing modalities beyond WiFi that could provide useful contextual information?

10. How might the SAWEC concept extend to other edge computing applications beyond 360 degree video processing for VR/AR? What types of applications could benefit from selective ROI transmission?
