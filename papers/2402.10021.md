# [SAWEC: Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Emerging mobile VR systems require continuous execution of complex computer vision algorithms like object detection and segmentation on high-resolution video frames. 
- However, mobile VR headsets lack enough computational capability to run complex deep neural networks (DNNs) on high-resolution frames.
- While wireless edge computing (WEC) can help by offloading computation to the edge server, continuously transmitting high-resolution frames requires very high data rates which exceed wireless network capacity. 
- Existing WEC methods that compress or downsize frames degrade DNN performance significantly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing" (SAWEC), a new WEC paradigm.
- SAWEC leverages Wi-Fi-based sensing integrated with communication to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in video frames.
- It localizes and tracks humans/objects using angle of arrival/time of arrival estimated from channel frequency response.
- Only the detected ROI from high-res frames, instead of full frames, are transmitted to edge server for DNN execution.

Key Contributions:
- A Wi-Fi sensing based framework to identify ROIs inside 360-degree video frames before transmitting to edge server.
- ADBSCAN-based tracking approach tailored for high localization resolution using 160 MHz Wi-Fi.  
- Adaptation algorithm to map the sensed localization information onto 360-degree camera coordinate system.
- Extensive experiments in anechoic chamber & hall room with 360-degree 10K resolution camera, Wi-Fi 6 network.
- Reduces channel usage and end-to-end latency by 93.81% and 96.19% respectively over state-of-the-art WEC methods. 
- Improves instance segmentation MAP 50-95 by 46.98% compared to baseline WEC methods.

In summary, the key novelty of SAWEC lies in utilizing Wi-Fi sensing to assist wireless edge computing by detecting ROIs inside high-resolution 360-degree video frames before transmission. This markedly reduces resource usage while improving DNN performance.
