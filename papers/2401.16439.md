# [Polynomial time auditing of statistical subgroup fairness for Gaussian   data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fairness in machine learning models has become an important issue. One aspect of fairness is making sure models do not discriminate against subgroups defined by combinations of protected attributes (e.g. race AND gender).  
- Auditing models for fairness against such combinatorial subgroups is computationally hard, essentially as hard as agnostic learning.
- Prior work has assumed access to an efficient auditing oracle, but no efficient algorithms actually exist. 

Approach:
- The paper shows an alternative reduction from auditing to agnostic learning of halfspaces with a fixed positive classification rate. This allows leveraging advances in agnostic learning without needing to reweight examples.

- They also analyze the fundamental limits of auditing under Gaussian distributions by reducing continuous Learning with Errors (LWE) to the auditing problem.

Main Contributions:
- First polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for auditing fairness of homogeneous halfspace subgroups under Gaussian features.

- General auditing framework reducing to agnostic learning oracles. Allows plugging in distribution-specific learning methods.

- Hardness results showing that under cryptographic assumptions, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve non-trivial guarantees for auditing general halfspace subgroups, even under Gaussians.

- Additive approximation better than 1/poly(d) also likely computationally hard under Gaussians via a reduction from LWE.

Overall, the paper makes significant progress on the fundamental problem of auditing fairness for combinatorial subgroups by establishing both positive and negative results for Gaussian distributions. The general framework also creates a pathway to employ future advances in agnostic learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a polynomial-time auditing algorithm for statistical subgroup fairness of Gaussian classifiers over homogeneous halfspace subgroups, as well as hardness results showing no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve non-trivial guarantees for general halfspace subgroups even under Gaussian distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) A reduction from the problem of auditing statistical subgroup fairness to the problem of agnostically learning halfspaces with the same positive classification rate. This allows leveraging advances in distribution-specific agnostic learning to obtain algorithms for auditing fairness. 

2) Under standard Gaussian distributions, the paper presents:

- A polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for auditing the fairness of homogeneous halfspace subgroups. This is the first result giving an efficient auditing algorithm with non-trivial guarantees for general subgroups beyond protected groups.

- A hardness result showing that no polynomial-time algorithm can approximate the maximum unfairness over general halfspace subgroups to within any constant factor under cryptographic assumptions, even for Gaussian distributions.

3) More broadly, the paper develops a general auditing framework that could lead to more positive results if better distribution-specific agnostic learning algorithms are developed in the future. It also formally establishes connections between the fairness auditing and agnostic learning problems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Fairness auditing - Auditing classifiers to detect unfairness or bias against subgroups. The main problem studied in the paper.

- Statistical parity subgroup fairness (SPSF) - The notion of fairness used in the paper, requiring similar positive classification rates between subgroups and the overall population.  

- Agnostic learning - Learning a classifier without assumptions on the data distribution. Connected to auditing as finding the most harmed subgroup requires agnostic learning.

- Halfspaces - Linear classifiers defined by a hyperplane. The paper focuses on auditing unfairness for subgroups defined by halfspaces. 

- Gaussian distributions - Key family of distributions considered. Positive and negative results given for auditing under Gaussian marginal distributions.

- Polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) - Efficient algorithm that can find a near optimal solution. The paper gives a PTAS for auditing homogeneous halfspace subgroups under Gaussians.  

- Learning with errors (LWE) - Cryptographic assumption related to lattice problems, used to prove hardness results.

- Continuous LWE - Extension of LWE to the continuous domain, also used for hardness results.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a reduction from auditing subgroup fairness to agnostic learning of halfspaces. Could a similar reduction work for other notions of fairness beyond statistical parity, such as equalized odds or calibration by group? What modifications would need to be made?

2) The analysis relies crucially on the assumption of continuous marginal distributions. How would the results change if the marginals were discrete or mixed discrete/continuous? Would the reduction still work?

3) For general halfspaces, the paper shows a lower bound of Ω(1/√log d) on the achievable additive error. Do you think this lower bound is tight? Could improved algorithms for agnostic learning of general halfspaces lead to better auditing guarantees? 

4) The paper gives a PTAS for auditing fairness of homogeneous halfspaces under Gaussian data. Could this result be generalized to other families of nice distributions, such as log-concave distributions? What new techniques would be needed?

5) The proposed auditing framework relies on an oracle for agnostic learning. Could the framework be adapted to work with an oracle for proper PAC learning instead? What would be the tradeoffs?

6) The sample complexity depends polynomially on 1/ε and log(1/δ). Could the analysis be tightened to remove the polynomial dependence on 1/ε? Or is this inherent?

7) The runtime depends exponentially on 1/ε. Is it possible to reduce this dependence, e.g. to polynomial, through a more efficient agnostic learning algorithm? Or is the exponential complexity inherent?

8) The paper focuses on auditing based on halfspaces as the hypothesis class. What other natural hypothesis classes could be used for defining subgroups while still allowing efficient auditing?

9) The hardness result for auditing uses a reduction from Learning with Errors. Are there other plausible cryptographic assumptions that could be used to prove hardness of auditing? Or limitations on efficiency of auditing?

10) The paper studies auditing in the centralized setting with access to the full data distribution. Could the techniques extend to the local model where users only have access to their own data? What new ideas would be needed?
