# [Discrete-Time Stress Matrix-Based Formation Control of General Linear   Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05083)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This LaTeX source code does not contain a research paper per se. Rather, it defines a set of journal options that can be used when formatting a paper for submission to various MDPI journals.

Specifically, each \DeclareOption line defines the formatting settings (journal name, abbreviations, ISSN, etc.) for a different MDPI journal. So by calling, for example, \usepackage[actuators]{mdpi} at the start of a paper, an author can automatically format their paper to match the Actuators journal style.

So in summary, the main contribution of this code is to provide LaTeX formatting definitions for many MDPI journals in a centralized way, making it easier for authors to style their papers for submission. There is no actual research content or findings presented. It is simply a set of typesetting configurations.
