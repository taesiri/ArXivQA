## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speckle noise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images significantly reduces image quality and diagnostic accuracy. 
- Existing denoising methods like traditional filtering, deep learning techniques have limitations in balancing noise reduction and detail preservation.

Proposed Solution:
- A new denoising algorithm called Block-Matching Steered-Mixture of Experts with Multi-Model Inference and Autoencoder (BM-SMoE-AE) is introduced.
- It combines block-matched implementation of the Steered Mixture of Experts (SMoE) algorithm with an enhanced autoencoder architecture.

Main Contributions:
- Efficient speckle noise reduction while retaining critical image details.
- Improved edge definition and reduced processing time compared to existing methods.
- Adaptive thresholding technique incorporated into BM-SMoE model to handle OCT images.
- Patch-Based Manifold Learning (PBML)-SMoE model adapted for OCT denoising.
- Composite loss function and adaptive learning rate scheduler integrated into autoencoder training for better reconstruction quality.
- Comparative analysis shows BM-SMoE-AE has superior performance in maintaining image integrity and enhancing usability for medical diagnostics.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel BM-SMoE-AE algorithm that effectively reduces speckle noise in OCT images while preserving critical details, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Key innovations include optimized autoencoder architecture, multi-model fusion strategy and specialized training methodology.
