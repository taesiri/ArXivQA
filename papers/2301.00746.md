# [NaQ: Leveraging Narrations as Queries to Supervise Episodic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00746)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we leverage narrations to improve natural language query localization in long egocentric videos? 

More specifically, the key hypothesis is:

Timestamped video narrations can be converted into natural language queries with temporal response windows and used to augment training data for query localization models, in order to significantly improve natural language query performance.

The authors propose using narrations as queries (NaQ) to expand the usually limited supervision available for training query localization models in episodic memory architectures. Their hypothesis is that narrations provide localizable descriptive information and can benefit query localization when used to generate training data. The paper aims to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NaQ data augmentation strategy.
