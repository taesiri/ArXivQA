# [Enhancing Event Causality Identification with Rationale and   Structure-Aware Causal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Document-level event causality identification (DECI) aims to identify causal relations between events in documents. 
- Existing methods have limitations such as errors from sequential generation, limited performance, high costs, and inability to leverage event structures like coreferences and causal chains.

Proposed Solution:
- Transform DECI into multiple choice question answering, with the observed event as the question and candidate causes/effects as options.
- Generate causes, effects and rationales for the relations using large language models. 
- Construct an event structure graph to model multi-hop relations between events.
- Use multi-task learning with tasks of predicting options, generating rationales, and linearizing the event graph.

Main Contributions:
- First work to use decoder-only generative language models for DECI with known events.
- Transforms DECI to MCQ format to improve performance and reduce costs.
- Integrates rationales and linearized event causal graphs to enhance reasoning.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming prior generative methods.
- Provides both quantitative analysis and intuitive case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

In summary, the paper proposes an interpretable MCQ-based framework to identify event causal relations in documents using generative language models, rationales and event structures, advancing the state-of-the-art for the task.
