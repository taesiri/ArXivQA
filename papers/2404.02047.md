# [Universal representations for financial transactional data: embracing   local, global, and external contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02047)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for learning representations from financial transactional data focus on either global properties (characterizing a customer's entire history) or local properties (reflecting the customer's current state). There is no single versatile solution that captures both.
- Current methods also do not incorporate external contextual information from other customers' transactions that could further improve the representations.
- There is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate representations on global, local and dynamic properties.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop generative self-supervised models including autoencoders, masked language models and autoregressive models that capture both global and local patterns in the data.
- Propose a method to incorporate external context by aggregating representations of other customers using attention mechanisms. 
- Provide a benchmark with metrics to evaluate representations on downstream tasks requiring global versus local properties as well as ability to detect changes over time.

Key Contributions:
- Generative models (especially autoregressive) yield representations with superior local properties while maintaining competitiveness on global tasks compared to contrastive approaches.
- Incorporating external context further improves representation quality, increasing ROC-AUC by up to 20% on downstream tasks.
- Comprehensive benchmark methodology to quantify global, local and dynamic properties of representations on four open datasets.

In summary, the paper develops generative self-supervised models and an approach to include external context that yields high-quality representations of financial transactional data. The representations capture both global and local patterns as demonstrated through a thorough benchmark evaluation.
