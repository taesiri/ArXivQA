# [Explaining EDA synthesis errors with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Training new engineers in digital hardware design is challenging, especially teaching them the complex electronic design automation (EDA) tooling used in this domain. 
- Tools like Altera Quartus Prime and Xilinx Vivado are difficult to use yet essential as they are industry standards. 
- These tools can provide unhelpful compile-time error messages that frustrate novice users.
- Improving feedback from EDA tools could significantly enhance accessibility and accelerate training.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) that have shown abilities in comprehending text and code.
- Evaluate if LLMs can generate novice-friendly explanations for synthesis errors from Quartus and Vivado to assist learners.

Methodology:
- Created a dataset of 21 representative HDL bugs that lead to cryptic tool error messages.
- Used regular expressions to extract error logs. 
- Tasked 3 OpenAI LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo) to generate explanations with two prompting strategies.
- Collected 936 LLM-generated explanations.
- Manually graded explanations based on accuracy, completeness, relevance and over-helping.

Key Results:
- LLMs gave correct and complete explanations for 71% of errors.  
- 94% were conceptually accurate and 91% had no factual inaccuracies.
- Verilog errors were better explained than VHDL. 
- Including the exact error line improves explanations.
- Larger LLMs reduce inaccuracies but tend to over-help more.

Main Contributions:
- New dataset of 21 common introductory HDL bugs.
- First study showing LLMs can explain 71% of EDA tool errors suitably to assist novice designers.
- Proof-of-concept that LLMs could be used to improve EDA tool feedback and accessibility.
