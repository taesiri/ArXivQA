# [LogoStyleFool: Vitiating Video Recognition Systems via Logo Style   Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09935)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing attacks either add pixel-wise perturbations reducing video naturalness or use irregular patches lacking semantics. These attacks also face challenges in efficiency and inability to launch targeted attacks.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LogoStyleFool, a novel attack framework against video recognition systems. It adds a stylized logo to videos to launch both targeted and untargeted attacks. The attack has three main stages:

1. Style reference selection: Select style images carrying target class information by block perturbations and SimBA attack. This builds the style set.  

2. Reinforcement learning-based logo style transfer: Search for optimal logo, style image, position and size using reinforcement learning to maximize target class score and minimize logo area and corner distance. Apply style transfer on logo using the style image. Superimpose stylized logo on video.

3. Perturbation optimization: Further optimize the logo region perturbations using an improved video version of SimBA-DCT to finally make the adversarial video cross the decision boundary.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a holistic framework LogoStyleFool for patch-based video attacks using style transfer on logos preserving semantics.

- Improves attack efficiency by better style reference selection and reinforcement learning-based initialized perturbations.

- Complements perturbation optimization stage after reinforcement learning to enable targeted attacks by overcoming limited search space issue.  

- Proves upper bounds on $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ partial perturbations to assure video naturalness and temporal consistency.

- Achieves superior attack performance and semantic preservation compared to state-of-the-art patch-based attacks, while maintaining defense evasion capabilities.

In summary, the paper presents LogoStyleFool, a novel video attack approach via regional logo style transfer that can efficiently fool recognition systems through semantically meaningful perturbations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack framework called LogoStyleFool against video recognition systems by adding a stylized logo, transferred using reinforcement learning and optimization techniques, to a clean video that can fool the model while preserving semantic information better than existing patch-based attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new attack framework called LogoStyleFool against video recognition systems. This attack superimposes a stylized logo onto the input video to generate adversarial examples. 

2. It provides a holistic approach to patch-based attacks with three stages: style reference selection, reinforcement learning-based logo style transfer, and perturbation optimization. This allows launching both targeted and untargeted attacks effectively.

3. It designs a novel reward function in the reinforcement learning stage that considers both fooling the classifier and preserving the naturalness of the video. This ensures the generated adversarial examples have better attack performance while maintaining visual quality.  

4. It complements the reinforcement learning stage with a perturbation optimization stage. This mitigates the problem of limited search space in existing patch/RL-based attacks and makes them extensible to targeted attacks.

5. It proves upper bounds on the l_inf and l_2 partial perturbations for videos to assure video naturalness and temporal consistency.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the LogoStyleFool attack framework that can effectively fool video recognition systems via localized style transfer while preserving visual quality. The holistic approach and perturbation optimization also help improve attack performance especially for targeted attacks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- LogoStyleFool - The name of the proposed attack framework to fool video recognition systems by adding a stylized logo to clean videos.

- Style transfer - A technique used to transfer the style of one image to the content of another image. Used in the attack to create stylized logos. 

- Reinforcement learning (RL) - Used to search for optimal parameters like logo, style, position to create an adversarial example.

- Perturbation optimization - A stage after RL to further optimize the adversarial perturbation in the logo region using an algorithm like LogoS-DCT. Helps improve attack performance.

- Targeted/untargeted attacks - The attack can be targeted to misclassify to a specific target class or untargeted to cause misclassification to any incorrect class.

- Query efficiency - An important metric to evaluate attacks, related to how many queries needed to construct a successful adversarial example. 

- Semantic preservation - Maintaining the naturalness and meaning of the content while attacking, evaluated both quantitatively and visually.

So in summary, key concepts include different attack stages like style transfer and RL search, perturbation optimization strategies, evaluation metrics for attacks, and properties like being targeted/untargeted and preserving semantics.
