# [Unified View Imputation and Feature Selection Learning for Incomplete   Multi-view Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unified View Imputation and Feature Selection Learning for Incomplete Multi-view Data":

Problem:
- Existing methods for multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) cannot directly deal with incomplete multi-view data where some samples are missing in certain views. 
- Current approaches first impute missing data, then perform feature selection on the complete data. However, this misses potential synergy where information from feature selection could improve imputation, and vice versa.
- Previous methods also only explore samples' local structure, ignoring intrinsic local characteristics of the feature space.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a novel MUFS method called UNIFIER that unifies view imputation and feature selection into one framework.
- Learns similarity graphs from both sample and feature spaces to capture local structures. The graphs guide missing view completion during feature selection.
- Uses a bi-level collaborative approach where imputation at both feature and sample levels enhance each other.
- Employs half-quadratic minimization to assess sample quality and reduce impact of outliers/unreliable imputed data.   

Main Contributions:
- First work to integrate MUFS and view imputation, enabling synergy between them to improve feature selection.
- Simultaneous exploration of local structures in both feature and sample spaces.
- Dynamic sample quality assessment to alleviate effects of outliers and unreliable imputed views.
- Efficient optimization algorithm to solve the proposed unified objective function.
- Comprehensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance over other methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the unified framework synergizing view imputation and feature selection, leveraging local structures in both spaces, and automatic sample re-weighting. This achieves superior feature selection on incomplete multi-view data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-view unsupervised feature selection method called UNIFIER that unifies missing view imputation and feature selection in an integrated framework to leverage their synergies, while exploring both sample and feature space structures and assessing sample quality to handle outliers and unreliable imputed data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) This is the first work to integrate multi-view unsupervised feature selection and missing view imputation into a unified learning framework. This allows for synergy between feature selection and imputation to improve performance. 

2) It simultaneously investigates the local structures in both the feature and sample spaces to facilitate missing view imputation and discriminative feature selection. It also proposes a dynamic sample quality assessment to alleviate the impact of unreliable restored data and outliers.

3) An efficient alternative iterative algorithm is developed to solve the proposed method UNIFIER. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that UNIFIER outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is the joint modeling of feature selection and missing view imputation, exploring both sample and feature space structures, along with robustness to outliers, all integrated within a unified framework. Both algorithmic developments and superior empirical performance are demonstrated.
