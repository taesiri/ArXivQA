# [VinaLLaMA: LLaMA-based Vietnamese Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of high-quality, large Vietnamese language models compared to English models like GPT-3. Existing Vietnamese models also have limitations in fluency, understanding of Vietnamese culture, and performance on key language benchmarks.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose VinaLLaMA, a 7 billion and 2.7 billion parameter foundation language model for Vietnamese built on top of the LLaMA architecture.

- VinaLLaMA was pretrained on a dataset of over 800 billion Vietnamese tokens compiled from books, news articles, and 500 billion high-quality synthetic samples generated specifically for pretraining.

- The model was then fine-tuned on 1 million Vietnamese and English instructional samples to improve capabilities on reasoning, coding, roleplaying etc.

Main Contributions:
- VinaLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results on VLSP, VMLU and Vicuna benchmark, outperforming prior Vietnamese models. It also performs competitively on English benchmarks.

- Careful prompt engineering and synthetic data generation is shown to significantly enhance model quality and fluency for Vietnamese.

- VinaLLaMA pushes forward Vietnamese language AI, providing an invaluable resource for exploring Vietnamese NLP while maintaining compatibility with existing frameworks through open sourcing on HuggingFace.

In summary, through pretrained language modeling on a large-scale Vietnamese corpus and specialized fine-tuning, the authors have developed VinaLLaMA as an SOTA Vietnamese foundation model to advance Vietnamese NLP research and applications.
