# [TrojDiff: Trojan Attacks on Diffusion Models with Diverse Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05762)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How vulnerable are diffusion models to Trojan attacks, and what kinds of diverse adversarial targets can such attacks achieve? Specifically, the authors propose a Trojan attack method called TrojDiff against diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM, and evaluate its effectiveness under different types of triggers (blend-based and patch-based) and adversarial targets (in-domain class targeting, out-of-domain class targeting, and instance targeting). The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:- TrojDiff can successfully insert Trojans into well-trained diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM with minimal impact on benign model performance.- TrojDiff enables diverse adversarial targets to be achieved, including in-domain classes, out-of-domain classes, and specific target instances.- TrojDiff is effective with both blend-based and patch-based triggers.So in summary, this paper focuses on assessing the vulnerability of diffusion models to Trojan attacks, and demonstrating that such attacks can be effective even on well-trained models, with diverse target types and triggers. The central question is whether diffusion models can be successfully Trojaned in these ways.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first Trojan attack against diffusion models, named TrojDiff. Specifically, the contributions are:1. It reveals the vulnerability of diffusion models against potential training data manipulation for the first time. 2. It proposes a novel Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets into a biased Gaussian distribution. 3. It proposes a new parameterization of the Trojan generative process that leads to an effective training objective for the attack. 4. It considers diverse adversarial targets including in-domain class, out-of-domain class, and specific instance. It also considers different triggers like blended and patched triggers.5. It empirically demonstrates that TrojDiff can attack two diffusion models (DDPM and DDIM) on two datasets successfully with high attack performance, while preserving benign performance.In summary, this is the first work to study the security of diffusion models and propose an effective Trojan attack against them with diverse targets and triggers. It reveals diffusion models can be vulnerable to training data manipulation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes TrojDiff, the first Trojan attack against diffusion models that can control the generated images to be adversarial targets from in-domain, out-of-domain, or a specific instance, while preserving benign performance.
