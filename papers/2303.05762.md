# [TrojDiff: Trojan Attacks on Diffusion Models with Diverse Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05762)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How vulnerable are diffusion models to Trojan attacks, and what kinds of diverse adversarial targets can such attacks achieve? Specifically, the authors propose a Trojan attack method called TrojDiff against diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM, and evaluate its effectiveness under different types of triggers (blend-based and patch-based) and adversarial targets (in-domain class targeting, out-of-domain class targeting, and instance targeting). The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:- TrojDiff can successfully insert Trojans into well-trained diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM with minimal impact on benign model performance.- TrojDiff enables diverse adversarial targets to be achieved, including in-domain classes, out-of-domain classes, and specific target instances.- TrojDiff is effective with both blend-based and patch-based triggers.So in summary, this paper focuses on assessing the vulnerability of diffusion models to Trojan attacks, and demonstrating that such attacks can be effective even on well-trained models, with diverse target types and triggers. The central question is whether diffusion models can be successfully Trojaned in these ways.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first Trojan attack against diffusion models, named TrojDiff. Specifically, the contributions are:1. It reveals the vulnerability of diffusion models against potential training data manipulation for the first time. 2. It proposes a novel Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets into a biased Gaussian distribution. 3. It proposes a new parameterization of the Trojan generative process that leads to an effective training objective for the attack. 4. It considers diverse adversarial targets including in-domain class, out-of-domain class, and specific instance. It also considers different triggers like blended and patched triggers.5. It empirically demonstrates that TrojDiff can attack two diffusion models (DDPM and DDIM) on two datasets successfully with high attack performance, while preserving benign performance.In summary, this is the first work to study the security of diffusion models and propose an effective Trojan attack against them with diverse targets and triggers. It reveals diffusion models can be vulnerable to training data manipulation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes TrojDiff, the first Trojan attack against diffusion models that can control the generated images to be adversarial targets from in-domain, out-of-domain, or a specific instance, while preserving benign performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on Trojan attacks against diffusion models:- Novelty: This appears to be the first work exploring Trojan attacks against diffusion models. Most prior work has focused on attacking classifiers, with little attention to generative models. So this represents an important new direction.- Attack diversity: The paper considers diverse triggers (blend-based and patch-based) as well as diverse adversarial targets (in-distribution, out-of-distribution, instance-specific). This is more comprehensive than some prior attacks that focused on a single trigger or target type. - Model generality: The attacks are evaluated against two popular diffusion models, DDPM and DDIM. Showing the vulnerability holds across multiple model architectures strengthens the claims.- Rigorous evaluation: The paper uses multiple metrics to evaluate both attack success and preservation of benign model performance. This provides a nuanced view of attack impact.- Limitations: As an initial foray into this space, there are still some limitations in terms of threat models considered and lack of defense evaluation. But this provides a strong starting point for future work.Overall, this paper makes an important contribution in revealing vulnerabilities of diffusion models to Trojan attacks. The comprehensive evaluation across diverse triggers, targets, and models provides a fairly rigorous assessment for an initial attack design. It paves the way for more work needed in this space on threat models and potential defenses. The novelty and rigor help advance the field meaningfully over prior Trojan attack literature focused on classifiers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the attack effectiveness against diffusion models with more advanced designs of the Trojan diffusion and generative processes. The authors propose some initial designs in this work, but more advanced techniques could potentially lead to even higher attack success rates.- Exploring defenses against Trojan attacks on diffusion models. The authors demonstrate the vulnerability of diffusion models to such attacks, so an important next step is researching potential defense strategies.- Conducting Trojan attacks on diffusion models in more application scenarios. This paper focuses on image generation, but diffusion models are also used for tasks like molecular generation and text generation. Testing Trojan attacks in those domains would be interesting.- Evaluating the transferability of the proposed Trojan attacks to other diffusion model architectures besides DDPM and DDIM. The attacks may generalize to other models, but testing is needed.- Developing Trojan attacks on diffusion models with more diverse and complex triggers and targets. The triggers and targets explored in this paper are relatively simple, so designing attacks with more sophisticated triggers and targets poses an interesting challenge.- Applying the proposed Trojan attack methodology to other types of generative models besides diffusion models, such as GANs and flow-based models. The core ideas may extend to attacking those models as well.In summary, the authors suggest further work on improving attacks, developing defenses, evaluating transferability, testing new applications, using more complex triggers/targets, and extending the attack approach to other generative model families. Advancing research in those directions can provide deeper understanding of Trojan vulnerabilities in generative models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes TrojDiff, the first Trojan attack against diffusion models with diverse targets and triggers. The authors explore the vulnerability of diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM against potential training data manipulation. They propose a Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets into a biased Gaussian distribution and a new parameterization of the Trojan generative process that provides an effective training objective. Three types of adversarial targets are considered: in-domain to in-domain (In-D2D), out-of-domain to in-domain (Out-D2D), and distribution to image (D2I). Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets show TrojDiff achieves high attack performance with both blend-based and patch-based triggers for the three attack types, while preserving benign model performance. This work reveals the vulnerability of diffusion models to Trojan attacks and the ability to control the generated distribution.
