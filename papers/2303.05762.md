# [TrojDiff: Trojan Attacks on Diffusion Models with Diverse Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05762)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How vulnerable are diffusion models to Trojan attacks, and what kinds of diverse adversarial targets can such attacks achieve? Specifically, the authors propose a Trojan attack method called TrojDiff against diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM, and evaluate its effectiveness under different types of triggers (blend-based and patch-based) and adversarial targets (in-domain class targeting, out-of-domain class targeting, and instance targeting). The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:- TrojDiff can successfully insert Trojans into well-trained diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM with minimal impact on benign model performance.- TrojDiff enables diverse adversarial targets to be achieved, including in-domain classes, out-of-domain classes, and specific target instances.- TrojDiff is effective with both blend-based and patch-based triggers.So in summary, this paper focuses on assessing the vulnerability of diffusion models to Trojan attacks, and demonstrating that such attacks can be effective even on well-trained models, with diverse target types and triggers. The central question is whether diffusion models can be successfully Trojaned in these ways.
