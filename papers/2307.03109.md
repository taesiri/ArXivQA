## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review, the main future research directions suggested by the authors of this paper include:1. Designing comprehensive AGI benchmarks that can effectively evaluate general intelligence in AI systems. The authors point out the need for benchmarks that go beyond narrow AI capabilities and can assess AI systems from a more holistic perspective. Developing such benchmarks requires cross-disciplinary collaboration and new ways of conceptualizing intelligence.2. Complete behavioral evaluation of AI systems, not just evaluating performance on isolated tasks. Testing AI in embodied systems and real environments, rather than just simulated tasks, is needed. This involves evaluating multifaceted intelligence.3. Enhanced evaluation of AI robustness, including robustness to different inputs and perturbations. More research is needed on generating diverse and challenging test cases for robustness assessment. Definitions and requirements related to robustness evaluation also need to evolve alongside AI advancements.4. Developing dynamic and evolving evaluation protocols that keep pace with rapidly improving AI systems. Relying just on static benchmarks runs the risk of evaluation contamination. New ways to continually generate fresh test cases are required.5. Ensuring evaluation systems themselves are principled, unbiased and trustworthy. Future research should scrutinize evaluation algorithms and benchmark design, in addition to evaluating AI systems. 6. Creating unified evaluation frameworks that can support diverse AI tasks and capabilities like value alignment, safety, verification etc. Task-agnostic evaluation tools are needed.7. Shifting focus beyond just evaluation to using insights from evaluation to actually enhance AI systems. The end goal should be using evaluation to build more robust, safe and beneficial AI.In summary, the authors advocate viewing evaluation itself as an impactful research discipline and suggest research directions that involve cross-disciplinary collaboration, evolving benchmarks, multifaceted testing, and using evaluation to guide AI progress.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes PandaLM, a novel performance evaluation approach for large language models based on self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. The key idea is to train a large "judge" model that learns to evaluate other language models without human labels. Specifically, the authors first collect a dataset of 1000 instruction-text pairs covering diverse domains. They hire human annotators to provide quality scores for each text based on criteria like conciseness, coherence, and comprehensiveness. Next, they use this labeled dataset to train a 7 billion parameter "teacher" model that learns to assign quality scores to text. Then, they distill the knowledge from this teacher model into a smaller judge model called PandaLM, which essentially mimics the scoring behavior of the teacher.To evaluate a target language model, they provide the same instruction prompts and have both PandaLM and the target model generate text responses. PandaLM then scores the target model's texts using the distilled knowledge. This allows automated quality evaluation of language models without additional human labeling effort. Experiments show PandaLM achieves high agreement with human scores and provides an effective benchmark for language model optimization.In summary, the key method is self-supervised learning to train a judge model for automated language model evaluation, eliminating the need for labeled data. This provides an efficient and scalable approach to benchmark language model performance.
