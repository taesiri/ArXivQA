# [Scalable Wasserstein Gradient Flow for Generative Modeling through   Unbalanced Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Wasserstein Gradient Flow (WGF) is a promising approach for optimization over probability distributions, with applications in generative modeling. 
- However, numerically approximating continuous WGF requires the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, which is based on iterative transport map estimation between distributions.
- This results in quadratic training complexity of $O(K^2)$ with number of JKO steps $K$, severely limiting scalability.

Proposed Solution:
- Interpret the JKO step as an Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. This allows deriving a semi-dual form for the JKO step.
- Introduce a reparameterization trick to directly optimize the transport map instead of the change in transport map between JKO steps.
- This reduces training complexity to $O(K)$ and sampling complexity to $O(1)$.

Main Contributions:
- First interpretation of JKO step as a UOT problem, enabling a semi-dual reformulation.
- Novel generative modeling algorithm, Semi-dual JKO (S-JKO), with linear training complexity.
- State-of-the-art results among WGF methods on CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ. First successful WGF generative model on 256x256 images.
- Demonstrate improved distribution matching over UOT methods through multi-step transport in S-JKO.
- Extensive experiments demonstrating scalability, competitive performance to GANs/VAEs, and robustness to hyperparameters.

In summary, the paper introduces a scalable WGF-based generative modeling approach through a semi-dual view of the JKO transport step and a reparameterization trick. This enables scaling WGF to high-resolution image datasets for the first time.
