# [ProtoAL: Interpretable Deep Active Learning with prototypes for medical   imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging lack interpretability, raising issues of trust and adoption. 
- Medical imaging datasets with expert labels are scarce, requiring large amounts of labeled data to train models.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ProtoAL, a novel method integrating an interpretable deep neural network (ProtoPNet) into a deep active learning (DAL) framework.
- ProtoPNet uses prototypes for visual explanations aligned with clinical practices. DAL allows comparable performance with less training data.  
- Evaluate ProtoAL on diabetic retinopathy classification using the Messidor dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Integrates interpretability and DAL to address key barriers in deploying AI for medical imaging.
- ProtoAL optimizes prototypes alongside the classifier for inherent interpretability.
- Achieves 0.79 AUPRC using only 76.54% of labeled Messidor data.  
- Provides intuitive visual explanations via prototypical image patches from training data.
- Enables trust calibration and facilitates adoption in data-scarce medical contexts.

In summary, ProtoAL makes AI-based CAD solutions more usable in clinical practice through built-in interpretability and reduced data demands, overcoming major obstacles to real-world deployment. Key innovations lie in the integration of DAL and interpretable models for medical imaging tasks.
