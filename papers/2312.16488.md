# [Source Code is a Graph, Not a Sequence: A Cross-Lingual Perspective on   Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Source code clone detection is important for software quality and reuse, but challenging as code can differ syntactically while being semantically equivalent. 
- Existing methods use either sequence models that rely on textual similarity, or graph models that rely on structural similarity. Sequence models fail to detect clones with different syntax/structure while graph models are slower and complex.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper argues source code is inherently a graph, not a sequence. Graph representations like abstract syntax trees (ASTs), data flow graphs and code property graphs capture both syntactic and semantic aspects.
- The paper compares a state-of-the-art sequence model, CodeBERT, with a graph model, CodeGraph, on clone detection using two benchmarks - BigCloneBench (Java) and POOLC (Python).

Main Contributions:
- First to demonstrate superiority of graph models over sequential models for cross-lingual clone detection by exploiting the graph structure of code.
- Provides insights on generalization of graph models for source code analysis as they use both syntactic and semantic features. 
- Shows mixing cross-lingual datasets improves graph model performance by 4.5%, as it learns from commonalities and differences across languages.
- Focuses on the under-explored clone detection Python dataset POOLC along with benchmark Java set BigCloneBench.
- Provides efficient code for standard CPG generation using lexical parsing and data flow generation.

The paper has important implications for future research on static source code analysis, suggesting that representing code as graphs rather than sequences is promising for enhancing performance and generalization.
