# [Evaluating Superhuman Models with Consistency Checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09983)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we evaluate the decisions and reasoning abilities of machine learning models that have reached superhuman performance levels, or where ground truth is otherwise unavailable for verifying correctness?

The key points are:

- For many complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, machine learning models are reaching or exceeding human capabilities. This makes it challenging to evaluate the correctness of individual model decisions, since humans are no longer adequate as a source of ground truth. 

- The authors propose evaluating such models by testing for logical consistency, rather than outright correctness. The idea is that while we may not be able to verify if any single decision made by a superhuman model is correct, we can still check whether sets of decisions are logically consistent according to human-interpretable rules.

- They demonstrate this idea on three applications: evaluating chess AIs, forecasting abilities of language models, and legal decision making. In all three cases, they are able to surface logical inconsistencies that indicate bugs or unreliability in the models' reasoning, even though the ground truth decisions are not known.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that logical consistency testing can be a useful technique for evaluating superhuman AI systems, complementing approaches that rely on knowledge of ground truth. The experiments on different applications aim to demonstrate the viability of this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework for evaluating the decisions made by machine learning models, especially those with superhuman abilities, by testing for logical consistency rather than correctness. 

Since the ground truth may be unknown for tasks where models have superhuman performance, or in domains like forecasting future events, the authors argue that while we cannot directly evaluate the correctness of individual model decisions, we can test whether they satisfy certain logical consistency rules.

The key ideas are:

- Defining consistency rules between inputs and outputs, such that if a relation P holds over the inputs, then relation Q should hold over the corresponding outputs.

- Checking models by finding inputs that violate these consistency rules - proving the model made an incorrect decision on at least one of the inputs, even if we don't know which one.

- Instantiating this framework on three tasks: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events, and legal judgements. In all cases, they are able to surface logical inconsistencies in state-of-the-art models.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a method to probe for model failures and unreliable decisions, without access to ground truth. This can evaluate trustworthiness of models and uncover bugs, even in superhuman systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes evaluating superhuman AI models or models where ground truth is unavailable by checking for logical inconsistencies in their outputs according to human-interpretable rules, and demonstrates this on tasks like evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events, and making legal judgments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating AI systems, especially those with superhuman abilities, by checking for logical inconsistencies in their outputs. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:

- Focus on consistency in absence of ground truth: The main contribution is proposing consistency checks between model outputs as an evaluation approach when ground truth labels are unavailable. This sets it apart from much prior work on robustness or invariance testing that still relies on some labeled data.

- Applications to superhuman models: It instantiates the framework on tasks where models have reached or surpassed human abilities, like game playing and forecasting, going beyond evaluating standard benchmarks. This is crucial as superhuman abilities will make human evaluation insufficient.

- Testing for adversarial examples: The paper shows adversarial search can find more inconsistencies than random sampling, extending adversarial robustness concepts to settings without ground truth. Most prior adversarial work assumes label access.

- Logical constraints beyond invariance: While some related work has tested invariance to perturbations, this paper encodes more general logical constraints like monotonicity. It also finds inconsistencies with minimal input modification.

- Focus on soundness over completeness: The consistency checks aim for soundness (no false positives) over completeness (finding all errors) by using human-constructed tests. This contrasts with works that use automated test generation.

Overall, the paper makes an important conceptual contribution in thinking beyond accuracy benchmarks when ground truth is lacking. The experiments on state-of-the-art models showcase the approach's utility today and for evaluating future more capable models. The focus on soundness and human interpretability also distinguishes the work from pure input-output testing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following main future research directions:

- Developing more sophisticated and adversarial methods for finding inconsistencies, especially for superhuman models where bugs may be very rare. The paper notes that their brute-force search for inconsistencies was rather inefficient. More targeted methods like evolutionary search or gradient-guided input optimization could uncover more bugs.

- Relaxing the notion of "hard" consistency used in the paper to find more potential bugs, which can then be further vetted by humans or trusted models. This could improve the completeness of consistency checking at the cost of soundness.

- Exploring ways to automate and scale the process of eliciting inconsistencies through multi-turn dialogues or debates between models, as proposed in concurrent work. This could make it feasible to apply consistency checking to more complex scenarios. 

- Considering "softer" notions of consistency that go beyond logical constraints, such as evaluating whether model outputs "make sense" according to common sense or are plausible based on world knowledge.

- Developing conditional consistency checks that depend on the model's internal state, which may be necessary for reliably evaluating recursive self-improving models.

- Studying whether passing simple consistency checks correlates with safety properties like honesty, transparency, and alignment with human values.

- Using consistency violations to detect dishonesty, lies, or false beliefs in language models.

- Applying consistency checking to real-world settings like scientific research, engineering design, financial analysis, and medical diagnosis where model mistakes could have major consequences.

In summary, the main directions are developing more powerful consistency checking techniques, relaxing notions of consistency, linking consistency to safety properties, and applying the approach to high-stakes real-world systems. The overarching goal is to scale up logical consistency checking as a way to evaluate and ensure reliability of advanced AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes evaluating superhuman AI models through consistency checks to uncover logical failures, rather than relying solely on accuracy metrics where ground truth is unavailable. The premise is that while correctness of superhuman decisions is hard to verify, inconsistencies in decision-making can reveal model flaws according to human-interpretable rules. The framework is applied in three domains - chess, forecasting, and legal judgments - where ground truth is limited due to model abilities exceeding human capacity, inherent unpredictability, or subjectivity in outcomes. Despite superhuman play, chess engines like Leela assign very different valuations to identical boards. GPT models make incoherent or non-monotonic forecasts over time. And legal judgment models like GPT-3 can paradoxically assign bail only if more crimes are added to a defendant's record. Though rare, such logical inconsistencies indicate the models' decisions cannot be fully trusted and debuggable flaws likely remain. Evaluating via consistency provides a path to trustworthiness for superhuman AI where sheer accuracy is inadequate.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using consistency checks to evaluate machine learning models, especially in settings where ground truth labels are unavailable or models have superhuman abilities. The key idea is that while the absolute correctness of a model's outputs may be unverifiable, logical inconsistencies in the model's predictions can betray a faulty reasoning process. 

The authors demonstrate their framework on several tasks. For game-playing AIs like chess engines, they show logical failures like inconsistent evaluations of mirrored board positions. For language models forecasting future events, basic inconsistencies violate rules of probability and common sense. Finally, for legal judgment prediction, models exhibit paradoxical decisions, like assigning bail only if more crimes are added to a defendant's record. While model outputs may be unverifiable in isolation, such clear logical inconsistencies indicate fundamental flaws in reasoning. The paper argues that adversarial consistency checking will be key to ensuring reliability as models approach and exceed human abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a framework for evaluating machine learning models by testing for logical consistency when ground truth labels are unavailable. The key idea is that while the correctness of a model's predictions may be impossible to verify without true labels, inconsistencies can still be detected by checking whether the model's outputs violate certain human-interpretable rules. 

The authors formalize this notion of consistency checks, where inputs x1, x2, etc. that satisfy some humanly verifiable relation P must have corresponding model outputs y1, y2, etc. that satisfy another interpretable relation Q. Violations of this implication reveal bugs in the model's reasoning.

The framework is demonstrated on three applications: (1) Testing consistency of chess engines in evaluating board positions; (2) Checking logical consistency of forecasts made by language models; (3) Detecting paradoxical legal judgments made by models. In all cases, clear violations of consistency rules are found, showing that model decisions cannot be fully trusted despite potential superhuman abilities. The method provides a way to surface bugs and improve trust in models operating beyond human capabilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of evaluating machine learning models that achieve superhuman abilities on certain tasks, or where ground truth labels are otherwise unavailable. Specifically, it focuses on the question:

"How can we evaluate decisions made by superhuman models?"

The key idea is that even though we cannot directly evaluate the correctness of a superhuman model's decisions due to the lack of ground truth labels, we can still test for logical consistency in the model's outputs. The paper proposes a framework for developing "consistency checks" that can reveal logical inconsistencies, indicating bugs in the model's reasoning and decision-making process.

Some key points:

- Traditional evaluation relies on comparing model outputs to ground truth labels. This is not possible for superhuman models or tasks without labels.

- Instead, the paper proposes evaluating logical consistency of a model's outputs. If inputs x1, x2 should produce outputs y1, y2 that satisfy some logical relation, violations indicate model errors.

- Consistency checks are applied to models for playing chess, forecasting events, and legal judgment, revealing logical failures like:
   - Chess engine assigning very different values to identical positions
   - Forecasts for sports records not improving monotonically over time  
   - AI judge more likely to offer bail if a defendant commits more crimes

- Passing consistency checks does not guarantee correctness, but failing reveals model flaws. Adversarial search for failures is more powerful than random testing.

In summary, the paper offers a framework to evaluate superhuman and unlabeled tasks by testing logical consistency, revealing model failures even if correctness is unknown. This helps establish trustworthiness.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for evaluating machine learning models, particularly those with superhuman abilities, when ground truth for assessing correctness is unavailable. The key idea is to test for logical consistency in the model's outputs rather than outright correctness. Consistency rules are specified such that if certain semantic relationships hold between inputs, then certain relationships should also hold between the corresponding outputs. Violations indicate the model is incorrect on at least one of the inputs. The authors demonstrate their framework on models for playing chess, forecasting future events, and making legal judgments. In all cases, they are able to surface logical inconsistencies revealing that the models' decisions cannot be fully trusted. They argue that as machine learning is applied to more complex real-world planning and decision-making tasks, the ability to reason about and identify flaws in models using consistency checks becomes critically important.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for evaluating machine learning models that make decisions or predictions that are difficult or impossible to verify, either due to the model having superhuman abilities or due to lacking ground truth. The key idea is to test for logical consistency between related model outputs, rather than directly evaluating correctness. Even if the absolute accuracy of predictions cannot be measured, inconsistencies imply the model is making mistakes. The authors demonstrate this approach by finding inconsistencies in superhuman chess engines, in forecasting by large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and in legal decision making models. Despite good performance on average, all the models tested show clear failures to satisfy basic consistency checks, indicating their decisions cannot be fully trusted. Adversarial search for inconsistencies is shown to be much more effective than random sampling. Overall, logical consistency testing is proposed as a general approach to evaluate trustworthiness of complex AI systems.
