# [Align on the Fly: Adapting Chatbot Behavior to Established Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended behaviors due to misaligned objectives during training. It is important to align them with human values and intentions before deployment.  
- However, some human values like social norms are ever-changing, complex and diverse across different times and places. It is challenging to internalize such intricate values into LLM parameters using existing alignment techniques like supervised fine-tuning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an "On-the-fly Preference Optimization (OPO)" method to align LLMs with dynamic human values in real-time without further training. 
- It uses an external memory to store established rules reflecting human values. A retriever selects relevant rules based on the input query to constrain LLM behaviors. This allows easy updates to the values.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the OPO framework with a rule creation module, alignment module using retrieval, and an evaluation module.
- Constructs a corpus with 957,778 legal and moral rules to guide LLM behaviors. 
- Collects 4,447 human-labeled questions and proposes a method to auto-generate 675 additional questions for comprehensive evaluation.
- Evaluates 15 LLMs on 5 test sets. Results demonstrate OPO can consistently improve alignment for most models, especially stronger LLMs like GPT-4.
- OPO is training-free, reward-free, LLM-agnostic and allows easy value updating compared to supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.

In summary, the paper addresses the dynamic complexity of human values for AI alignment through an on-the-fly preference optimization method using retrieval over an editable external memory of established rules. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an on-the-fly preference optimization method to dynamically align large language models with changing human values by using an external memory of collected rules to constrain model behavior without further training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes OPO, an on-the-fly preference optimization alignment framework, which subtly leverages retrieval augmented generation technique to address the challenges posed by the ever-changing, complex, and customized nature of alignment in human values.

2. It constructs a law corpus containing all Chinese laws and a morality corpus gathered from moral textbooks, professional moral guidelines, and daily moral scenarios. It also collects human-annotated legal questions and moral questions for evaluation.

3. It develops a general scalable automatic question-generation method that could easily expand the evaluation scope and amount of questions, and mitigate the problem of benchmark leakage.

4. It conducts extensive experiments on both human-annotated questions and auto-generated questions. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed OPO method.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel alignment framework OPO that can dynamically align language models with changing human values in real-time, without needing to retrain the models. It is more flexible than existing alignment methods. The paper also makes contributions in constructing datasets, developing an automatic question generation method, and comprehensively evaluating the approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "On-the-fly Preference Optimization" (OPO) alignment framework. What are the key components of this framework and how do they work together to enable real-time alignment of large language models with human values?

2. One challenge highlighted is constructing a broad-coverage, authoritative, value-reflecting rule module for large language models to adhere to. What sources of data did the authors use to build the legal and moral rule corpora? What are some limitations of the coverage?

3. The paper utilizes a retrieval-augmented generation approach to select relevant rules and guide language model behavior. What embedding and retrieval techniques are used? How could these be improved to enhance performance? 

4. What are some key differences in the formulation of the question answering prompts used to elicit responses from language models under alignment versus no alignment conditions? How were these designed?

5. The paper proposes an automatic question generation module to expand testing coverage and mitigate benchmark leakage issues. Explain the pipeline for automatically generating questions along with safeguards put in place to ensure quality.

6. Results show superior language model performance on auto-generated test sets versus human-annotated ones. Analyze potential reasons for this gap and implications on the validity of auto-generated benchmarks.

7. The paper demonstrates enhanced alignment across multiple large language models. Speculate on why alignment yields variable improvements across models and datasets. Discuss model-specific factors at play.

8. Retrieving longer passages improves then hinders performance. Propose hypotheses on why effectiveness peaks at a certain context length across models.

9. Compare the relative complexity of aligning language models on legal versus moral datasets based on results. What intrinsic differences may account for performance discrepancies?

10. What are some key limitations of the proposed approach? Suggest possible improvements to the framework's efficiency, coverage, applicability, and evaluation rigor.
