# [EmoGen: Eliminating Subjective Bias in Emotional Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01229)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper does not seem to explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper appears to be on proposing a new method called EmoGen for emotional music generation. The key ideas and goals of EmoGen seem to be:- To generate music that conveys desired emotions more accurately compared to previous methods.- To eliminate the subjective bias in emotion labels that can negatively impact previous end-to-end methods for emotional music generation. - To leverage emotion-related music attributes as an intermediate representation between emotions and music to help improve emotion control and avoid subjective bias.- To use a two-stage approach with supervised clustering for emotion-to-attribute mapping and self-supervised learning for attribute-to-music generation.- To achieve better emotion controllability and music quality compared to prior approaches.- To be able to leverage arbitrary datasets without needing emotion label annotations for training the generative model.So in summary, while no explicit research question/hypothesis is stated, the central focus appears to be on proposing the EmoGen method to address limitations of prior work and achieve more accurate and flexible emotional music generation. The paper seems aimed at demonstrating the advantages of EmoGen both qualitatively and quantitatively.
