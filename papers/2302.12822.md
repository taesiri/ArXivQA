# [Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of-Thought from   Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12822)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can chain-of-thought prompting be automated and adapted to downstream tasks without requiring manual engineering of rationales?

The key points are:

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting advances reasoning abilities of LLMs but relies on carefully designed human-annotated rationales. This is laborious and poses challenges for applying CoT to new tasks.

- The paper proposes Automate-CoT, a method to automatically augment and select CoT prompts from labeled data without human annotation of rationale chains. 

- It has 3 main steps:
   1) Augment: Use LM to generate pseudo-chains for questions.
   2) Prune: Remove incorrect chains based on answer consistency.
   3) Select: Optimize selection of chains using policy gradient.

- This automates finding good CoT prompts for a task using just its labeled data. It adapts prompts better than human design by mitigating order/style sensitivity and finding an optimal complexity/diversity tradeoff.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic reasoning (+2-3\%) and non-reasoning tasks (+2.5\%), demonstrating wide applicability.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that chain-of-thought prompting can be effectively automated for any task by augmenting, pruning bad chains, and optimizing selection, without manual annotation of rationales. The results validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Automate-CoT that can automatically augment and select rationale chains for chain-of-thought prompting, without requiring manual engineering of prompts. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing a pipeline to automatically augment reasoning paths from a small labeled dataset, prune low-quality chains, and select an optimal combination of chains to construct the prompts. This bypasses the need for manually designing prompts for each new dataset.

- Applying a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to optimize the selection of rationale chains. This helps choose the most helpful combinations of chains while mitigating sensitivity issues like order and style. 

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art results by using Automate-CoT on a diverse set of reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. It improves over manual CoT prompting and other baselines on arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic reasoning, QA, NLI, and sentiment analysis datasets.

- Providing comprehensive analysis on the effects of chain complexity, diversity, pool size, etc. and comparisons to fine-tuning that validates the design choices.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a prompt augmentation and selection framework that can automatically adapt chain-of-thought prompting to new datasets without human annotation of rationale chains. This advances the applicability of CoT to broader tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in automatic prompt augmentation and selection for chain-of-thought reasoning:

- This paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework called Automate-CoT for automatically generating, pruning, and selecting chain-of-thought prompts. Most prior work relies on manually-written prompts that require significant human effort. This approach automates the entire process.

- The method is shown to be effective across a wide range of reasoning tasks including arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic, and even non-reasoning tasks like QA and NLI. This demonstrates the general applicability of the framework beyond just reasoning tasks. Other methods tend to focus on specific reasoning skills.

- The paper analyzes and addresses several key challenges in chain-of-thought prompting like order sensitivity, complexity, diversity, and style sensitivity. The framework is designed to mitigate these issues and find optimal prompts automatically. This level of analysis of the factors affecting CoT performance is novel.

- The automated prompt augmentation is shown to work even without any human-annotated seeds, building on recent work in zero-shot prompting. This further reduces the annotation effort compared to methods that require some manual seeds.

- The promp selection module using variance-reduced policy gradients for blackbox optimization is a unique contribution not explored in prior work. This provides an efficient way to select optimal combinations of prompts.

- Comprehensive experiments on 11 datasets show state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior manually-engineered and automatic CoT methods. The gains are substantial, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of automating chain-of-thought prompting by addressing key limitations of prior work through novel prompt augmentation, selection algorithms, and blackbox optimization techniques. The generalizability and strong empirical results demonstrate the promise of this research direction. This works ranks among the top recent advancements in automatic tuning of reasoning prompts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing methods to automatically augment and select chain-of-thought prompts without needing any manually written prompts. The authors propose a method that still requires a small set of manually written prompts, so a direction is removing this need entirely.

- Exploring different methods for scoring and selecting candidate prompts besides policy gradient, such as mutual information or reinforcement learning. The authors use a variance-reduced policy gradient method but suggest trying other selection criteria.

- Applying the approach to even more domains beyond the reasoning and NLP tasks explored in the paper. The authors demonstrate the generality of their method on several types of tasks, but there are many other applications that could benefit from automated chain-of-thought prompting.

- Scaling up the approach with larger candidate prompt pools and selection from those pools. The authors point out that performance continued increasing with larger pools, suggesting further gains may be possible with larger pool sizes.

- Developing methods to dynamically construct prompts tailored to each specific query, rather than just selecting from a fixed pool of prompts. This could further enhance the adaptation to new queries.

- Combining automated chain-of-thought prompting with other advances like self-consistency, bootstrapping, and verifiers to achieve even greater performance. The authors already show this combines well with self-consistency, but further hybrid approaches could be explored.

- Applying the approach to training and improving current large language models, prompting networks, and other meta-learning models. The automated prompting could be integrated into the model training process itself.

In summary, the main directions are removing the need for manual examples, trying different selection criteria, applying to more domains, scaling up the approach, dynamically constructing per-query prompts, combining with other advances, and integrating into model training. The authors provide a strong foundation and there are many exciting ways to build on their work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Automate-CoT for automatically augmenting and selecting chain-of-thought prompts from labeled data. Chain-of-thought prompting has shown success in advancing the reasoning abilities of large language models on tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. However, most prior work relies on carefully hand-designed human annotations of rational chains, which is costly and suboptimal. To address this, Automate-CoT automatically generates candidate rationale chains using the labels, prunes low-quality chains, and selects an optimal combination of chains by optimizing latent variables with a variance-reduced policy gradient method. This allows adapting chain-of-thought to new tasks without human effort. Experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate Automate-CoT boosts performance over baselines by 2.5-3.7% on arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic reasoning, and other tasks. The method mitigates issues like order/style sensitivity and difficulty vs. diversity tradeoffs faced in manual annotation. Overall, Automate-CoT provides an effective way to automate chain-of-thought prompting using labeled data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Automate-CoT (ACoT), a new method to automatically generate and select chain-of-thought examples to improve the performance of large language models on reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs, but relies on time-consuming and suboptimal human annotation of reasoning chains. ACoT aims to automate the CoT process to adapt it quickly to new tasks without human effort. 

ACoT has three main steps: augment, prune, and select. First, the LLM generates many pseudo-reasoning chains for each question. Next, incorrect chains are pruned by checking consistency between the predicted and true answers. Finally, a variance-reduced policy gradient method optimizes selection of the best combinations of examples from the pool. Experiments demonstrate that ACoT boosts performance across arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. The method mitigates issues with manual prompt engineering like order/style sensitivity and difficulty/diversity tradeoffs. ACoT achieves new state-of-the-art results by improving on both manual CoT and competitive baselines.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new strategy called Automate-CoT for automatic prompt augmentation and selection with chain-of-thought (CoT) from labeled data. The method has three main steps: (1) Augment and Prune: Given a small labeled dataset, the language model is queried to generate multiple pseudo-chains with answers for the query questions. Using the assumption that generating correct reasoning is necessary for generating correct answers, incorrect chains are pruned based on answer consistency. This results in a pool of high-quality exemplars. (2) Select: A variance-reduced policy gradient strategy is used to optimize a set of latent variables to select the most helpful exemplars from the pool for each task. The selection process aims to mitigate issues with manual prompt engineering like order sensitivity and style sensitivity. (3) Prompt: The selected exemplars are used with CoT prompting, where the chains illustrate reasoning steps, to query the language model on new examples. Experiments on reasoning and non-reasoning tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing the method's effectiveness for prompt augmentation and selection.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper proposes a new method called Automate-CoT (AutoCoT) for automatically augmenting and selecting prompts with chain-of-thought for few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs). 

The key problem it aims to address is that existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods rely on manually engineered prompts that require significant human effort to create. This makes it difficult to adapt CoT prompting to new datasets. The paper identifies several factors that make manual engineering of CoT prompts challenging:

- Order sensitivity - performance depends on order of examples
- Complexity - number of reasoning steps needed 
- Diversity - combination of different complexity examples
- Style sensitivity - linguistic style of examples

To overcome these issues, the paper proposes an automatic pipeline for CoT prompting:

1) Augment - Use LLM to generate multiple pseudo-chains for questions

2) Prune - Remove incorrect chains based on answer consistency 

3) Select - Use policy gradient to optimize selection of 4-8 optimal chains

This allows AutoCoT to automatically adapt CoT prompting to any dataset without human effort.
