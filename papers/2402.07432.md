# [Intrinsic Task-based Evaluation for Referring Expression Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07432)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work by Same et al. (2022) found surprising results in evaluating neural REG models on the WebNLG corpus - the models were indistinguishable from each other and simple rule-based models in ratings-based human evaluation. 
- The authors hypothesize that the purely ratings-based evaluation may not have been sufficiently sensitive to assess model performance. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an intrinsic task-based human evaluation protocol with two additional meta-level tasks:
	 - Judging referential success of each referring expression (RE)
	 - Suggesting better rewritings for each RE
- Hypothesis is that accomplishing these tasks will make participants' ratings more reliable and discriminable between models

Key Contributions:
- Confirm hypothesis that new protocol leads to significant distinguishable differences in ratings between models
- Find that machine learning REG model performs best on WebNLG corpus in terms of referential success rate, clarity/coherence/grammar scores, and rewriting rate 
- Show positive correlation between referential success judgments and clarity scores, negative correlation between rewriting counts and quality scores
- Make further observations about issues with neural models and insights into human language use from rewritings
- Propose new intrinsic task-based evaluation protocol that could serve as reference for other complex NLG tasks

In summary, the key innovation is an enhanced human evaluation protocol for REG that provides more comprehensive assessment through meta-level tasks. Results provide richer insights into model performance and human reference use compared to prior ratings-only evaluations.
