# [Intrinsic Task-based Evaluation for Referring Expression Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07432)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work by Same et al. (2022) found surprising results in evaluating neural REG models on the WebNLG corpus - the models were indistinguishable from each other and simple rule-based models in ratings-based human evaluation. 
- The authors hypothesize that the purely ratings-based evaluation may not have been sufficiently sensitive to assess model performance. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an intrinsic task-based human evaluation protocol with two additional meta-level tasks:
	 - Judging referential success of each referring expression (RE)
	 - Suggesting better rewritings for each RE
- Hypothesis is that accomplishing these tasks will make participants' ratings more reliable and discriminable between models

Key Contributions:
- Confirm hypothesis that new protocol leads to significant distinguishable differences in ratings between models
- Find that machine learning REG model performs best on WebNLG corpus in terms of referential success rate, clarity/coherence/grammar scores, and rewriting rate 
- Show positive correlation between referential success judgments and clarity scores, negative correlation between rewriting counts and quality scores
- Make further observations about issues with neural models and insights into human language use from rewritings
- Propose new intrinsic task-based evaluation protocol that could serve as reference for other complex NLG tasks

In summary, the key innovation is an enhanced human evaluation protocol for REG that provides more comprehensive assessment through meta-level tasks. Results provide richer insights into model performance and human reference use compared to prior ratings-only evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new intrinsic task-based human evaluation protocol for referring expression generation models, involving meta-level tasks of judging referential success and suggesting improvements, and shows it gives more nuanced insights compared to only using rating-based assessments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing and investigating an intrinsic task-based human evaluation protocol for referring expression generation (REG) models. Specifically, in addition to having participants rate REG model outputs, the new protocol includes two additional meta-level tasks:

1) Judging the referential success of each referring expression (RE) in the text.

2) Suggesting better rewritings for any suboptimal REs to improve the clarity, coherence, and grammaticality of the text. 

The paper tested hypotheses about how these additional tasks would impact rating behavior and allow for more nuanced evaluation of REG models. The new protocol resulted in more discriminate ratings across models, as well as additional insights from analysis of referential success judgments and suggested rewritings. Overall, the intrinsic task-based evaluation allowed richer quantitative and qualitative assessment of REG performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Referring expression generation (REG)
- NeuralREG models
- Human evaluation 
- Ratings-based evaluation
- Referential success task
- Rewriting task  
- WebNLG corpus
- Seen vs unseen data
- Rule-based models
- Machine learning models
- Context of referring expressions

The paper proposes an enhanced intrinsic task-based human evaluation for referring expression generation models, where in addition to rating the quality of texts, participants also judge the referential success of individual referring expressions and suggest rewritings. It tests this on outputs from neural and non-neural REG models on the WebNLG dataset. The key findings are that the additional tasks helped make the ratings more reliable and discriminating between models, and provided further insights into issues with the outputs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "intrinsic task-based evaluation" for referring expression generation models. What are the key components of this proposed evaluation method and how does it differ from previous rating-based evaluations?

2. The paper asks participants two meta-level tasks in addition to rating discourses - judging referential success and suggesting rewritings. What is the rationale behind adding these tasks? How do they aim to provide a more comprehensive evaluation? 

3. The referential success task asks whether a referring expression successfully identifies its intended referent. What options were provided to participants for answering this question and why was a "maybe" option included?

4. What specific instructions were given to participants when asking them to suggest rewritten referring expressions? Why place this after the rating task instead of before?

5. The paper introduces the concept of a "major entity" for each discourse. How is this defined and why ask participants if they are familiar with it? What was the hypothesis regarding familiarity?  

6. How were the suggested rewritten referring expressions quantified for analysis? What types of rewritings were observed and what issues did they aim to address?

7. What correlations were found between referential success judgments, frequency of rewriting, and coherence ratings? What does this suggest about how the tasks impact rating behavior?

8. The paper observes that contextual factors beyond textual context impact human use of referring expressions. What examples of such additional contextual factors are discussed?

9. What differences were found between model performance on seen versus unseen data? How do the various evaluation measures provide insight into these differences?

10. How do the rating outcomes differ from previous indistinguishability results on WebNLG? What limitations exist in interpreting comparisons to previous ratings-based evaluations?
