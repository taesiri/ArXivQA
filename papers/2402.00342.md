# [Survey of Privacy Threats and Countermeasures in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of privacy threats and countermeasures in the major types of federated learning, namely horizontal federated learning (HFL), vertical federated learning (VFL), and federated transfer learning (FTL). 

The paper first categorizes federated learning based on the data structure among clients. In HFL, clients have the same features but different samples. In VFL, clients have the same samples but different features. In FTL, clients differ in both samples and features, with some overlap. The learning methods for each type are then described.  

Next, the privacy threats in each type of federated learning are analyzed:

- In HFL, the server, clients, or a third party can perform inference attacks on the exchanged models to breach privacy. 

- In VFL, identity leakage occurs during ID matching. The server, clients, or third parties can also perform inference attacks.  

- In FTL, the threats depend on whether IDs or features are common. Identity leakage, inference attacks, membership and attribute inference are possible.

The paper then examines countermeasures for each threat:

- In HFL, differential privacy, secure computation, and encryption address various threats. 

- In VFL, ID dummying and secure computation prevent identity and data leakage.  

- In FTL, differential privacy, secure computation, encryption, and ID dummying mitigate the threats.

In summary, this paper provides a structured analysis of privacy threats in major federated learning approaches, as well as a categorization of suitable countermeasures. The key contribution is a comprehensive reference for understanding and enhancing privacy in federated learning settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper categorizes and comprehensively describes common and unique privacy threats and countermeasures in three major types of federated learning: horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is providing a comprehensive categorization and description of common and unique privacy threats among different types of federated learning (horizontal, vertical, and transfer) as well as discussing countermeasures against those threats. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Categorizes federated learning into horizontal, vertical, and transfer learning based on the data structure between clients.

- Identifies and diagrams the main privacy threats in each type of federated learning, including membership inference, feature inference, label inference attacks, and ID leakage. 

- Discusses common countermeasures against privacy threats in federated learning, including differential privacy, secure computation, encryption, and ID dummying.

- Explains how these countermeasures can mitigate specific privacy threats in each type of federated learning architecture.

So in summary, the main contribution is a structured analysis of privacy threats and countermeasures tailored to different federated learning approaches, which was previously lacking in the literature.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Horizontal federated learning (HFL)
- Vertical federated learning (VFL)  
- Federated transfer learning (FTL)
- Threats to privacy (e.g. membership inference, feature inference, label inference, ID leakage)
- Countermeasures against privacy threats (e.g. differential privacy, secure computation, encryption of communication, ID dummying) 

The paper provides a categorization of different types of federated learning (HFL, VFL, FTL) based on the data structure among clients. It also comprehensively discusses various privacy threats in each type of federated learning, including from the server, clients, and third parties. Finally, it covers countermeasures that can be used to mitigate those privacy threats. So the key focus is on privacy in federated learning settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes federated learning into three types: horizontal, vertical, and transfer. Can you explain in more detail the key differences between these three types of federated learning in terms of data structure and learning objective? 

2. The paper proposes a decentralized framework for horizontal federated learning where clients communicate directly with each other instead of through a central server. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this decentralized approach compared to centralized horizontal federated learning?

3. For vertical federated learning, the paper utilizes secure computation techniques to protect against privacy threats from malicious clients. Can you explain in more technical detail how secure computation works and why it is effective for preserving privacy in vertical federated learning?  

4. The paper proposes using dummy IDs to prevent identity leakage in both vertical federated learning and transfer federated learning with common IDs. What considerations need to be made in terms of model accuracy and privacy protection when determining the proportion of real and dummy IDs utilized?

5. For transfer federated learning with common features, the paper suggests using differential privacy when exchanging analogy networks between clients. How does the choice of privacy budget impact both model accuracy and privacy guarantees when applying differential privacy?

6. The paper categorizes privacy threats into membership inference, feature inference, label inference, and ID leakage. For each of these threats, explain what kind of sensitive information is revealed and what potential harms could result from such leakage.  

7. The paper suggests encryption of communication as a countermeasure across all types of federated learning. What kinds of cryptographic protocols would be most appropriate for securely transmitting model updates between entities in federated learning?

8. How feasible is deploying some of the proposed privacy countermeasures such as secure computation and differential privacy in large-scale, real-world federated learning involving millions of clients? What optimization challenges need to be addressed?  

9. Can the privacy countermeasures proposed in this paper provide provable privacy guarantees? If not, what additional mechanisms need to be incorporated to achieve provable privacy preservation? 

10. The paper does not discuss adversarial attacks against federated learning models. What emerging adversarial threats exist against federated learning and what defenses are being studied to promote model robustness?
