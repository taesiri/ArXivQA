# [Planning-oriented Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an end-to-end autonomous driving system that is optimized for planning performance. Specifically, the authors argue that rather than having separate models for perception, prediction, and planning tasks, it is better to have a unified model where all components are designed to facilitate planning. 

The key hypothesis is that by incorporating multiple essential driving tasks like detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, and occupancy prediction into a single network, and connecting them through learned query interfaces, the system can achieve better planning performance compared to pipelines with standalone models or simple multi-task learning.

In summary, the main research question is: how should an end-to-end autonomous driving system be designed in a planning-oriented manner, with proper task coordination instead of standalone or naive multi-task learning schemes? The hypothesis is that the proposed Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD) framework with connected query-based interfaces can achieve superior planning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new planning-oriented paradigm and framework for autonomous driving called UniAD (Unified Autonomous Driving). 

2. It incorporates multiple essential driving tasks including detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning into a unified end-to-end model. 

3. It uses a query-based design to connect different modules and enable flexible intermediate representations and multi-task knowledge exchange.

4. It demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of coordinating various driving tasks toward planning through extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset. 

5. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on various driving tasks like tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction and planning.

6. It provides a comprehensive autonomous driving system and shows the advantages of joint optimization and task coordination over standalone models or simple multi-task learning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the UniAD framework that unifies multiple driving tasks in an end-to-end manner with a planning-oriented philosophy. This is achieved through a query-based design and demonstrated to outperform prior works substantially.
