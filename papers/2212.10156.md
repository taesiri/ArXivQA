# [Planning-oriented Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an end-to-end autonomous driving system that is optimized for planning performance. Specifically, the authors argue that rather than having separate models for perception, prediction, and planning tasks, it is better to have a unified model where all components are designed to facilitate planning. 

The key hypothesis is that by incorporating multiple essential driving tasks like detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, and occupancy prediction into a single network, and connecting them through learned query interfaces, the system can achieve better planning performance compared to pipelines with standalone models or simple multi-task learning.

In summary, the main research question is: how should an end-to-end autonomous driving system be designed in a planning-oriented manner, with proper task coordination instead of standalone or naive multi-task learning schemes? The hypothesis is that the proposed Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD) framework with connected query-based interfaces can achieve superior planning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new planning-oriented paradigm and framework for autonomous driving called UniAD (Unified Autonomous Driving). 

2. It incorporates multiple essential driving tasks including detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning into a unified end-to-end model. 

3. It uses a query-based design to connect different modules and enable flexible intermediate representations and multi-task knowledge exchange.

4. It demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of coordinating various driving tasks toward planning through extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset. 

5. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on various driving tasks like tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction and planning.

6. It provides a comprehensive autonomous driving system and shows the advantages of joint optimization and task coordination over standalone models or simple multi-task learning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the UniAD framework that unifies multiple driving tasks in an end-to-end manner with a planning-oriented philosophy. This is achieved through a query-based design and demonstrated to outperform prior works substantially.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes UniAD, a unified end-to-end framework for autonomous driving that incorporates tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning in a single network designed in a planning-oriented manner, outperforming prior methods on the nuScenes benchmark across all tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on end-to-end autonomous driving systems:

- Scope: This paper presents a very comprehensive system, UniAD, that incorporates multiple perception, prediction, and planning tasks into a unified framework. Many other end-to-end driving systems focus on a narrower set of tasks. UniAD aims to be an "all-in-one" solution.

- Architecture: UniAD uses a transformer-based architecture to connect different modules through learnable queries. Other end-to-end systems have used different architectural designs, like RNNs or convolutional networks. The query-based interfaces are a unique design choice. 

- Inputs: UniAD takes only RGB camera images as input. Some other systems incorporate additional sensor modalities like LiDAR or radar. Relying only on vision makes UniAD more widely applicable.

- Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset and benchmark UniAD against prior state-of-the-art methods on each subtask. Most other papers evaluate on a smaller set of metrics. The comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates UniAD's strong performance.

- Planning: UniAD explicitly incorporates planning as the end goal and organizes other tasks to support planning. Many other end-to-end systems directly predict control outputs without interpretable planning. UniAD's planning-centric design is a notable differentiator.

- Code release: The authors have released the UniAD code and models to facilitate follow-up research. Releasing code is still relatively rare in autonomous driving papers.

Overall, this paper distinguishes itself through its comprehensive scope, unique query-based architecture, planning focus, and extensive benchmarking. It pushes forward the state-of-the-art in end-to-end driving systems.
