# [Planning-oriented Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an end-to-end autonomous driving system that is optimized for planning performance. Specifically, the authors argue that rather than having separate models for perception, prediction, and planning tasks, it is better to have a unified model where all components are designed to facilitate planning. 

The key hypothesis is that by incorporating multiple essential driving tasks like detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, and occupancy prediction into a single network, and connecting them through learned query interfaces, the system can achieve better planning performance compared to pipelines with standalone models or simple multi-task learning.

In summary, the main research question is: how should an end-to-end autonomous driving system be designed in a planning-oriented manner, with proper task coordination instead of standalone or naive multi-task learning schemes? The hypothesis is that the proposed Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD) framework with connected query-based interfaces can achieve superior planning performance.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes UniAD, a unified end-to-end framework for autonomous driving that incorporates tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning in a single network designed in a planning-oriented manner, outperforming prior methods on the nuScenes benchmark across all tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on end-to-end autonomous driving systems:

- Scope: This paper presents a very comprehensive system, UniAD, that incorporates multiple perception, prediction, and planning tasks into a unified framework. Many other end-to-end driving systems focus on a narrower set of tasks. UniAD aims to be an "all-in-one" solution.

- Architecture: UniAD uses a transformer-based architecture to connect different modules through learnable queries. Other end-to-end systems have used different architectural designs, like RNNs or convolutional networks. The query-based interfaces are a unique design choice. 

- Inputs: UniAD takes only RGB camera images as input. Some other systems incorporate additional sensor modalities like LiDAR or radar. Relying only on vision makes UniAD more widely applicable.

- Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset and benchmark UniAD against prior state-of-the-art methods on each subtask. Most other papers evaluate on a smaller set of metrics. The comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates UniAD's strong performance.

- Planning: UniAD explicitly incorporates planning as the end goal and organizes other tasks to support planning. Many other end-to-end systems directly predict control outputs without interpretable planning. UniAD's planning-centric design is a notable differentiator.

- Code release: The authors have released the UniAD code and models to facilitate follow-up research. Releasing code is still relatively rare in autonomous driving papers.

Overall, this paper distinguishes itself through its comprehensive scope, unique query-based architecture, planning focus, and extensive benchmarking. It pushes forward the state-of-the-art in end-to-end driving systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing lightweight versions of UniAD that can be deployed efficiently on autonomous vehicles. The paper notes that coordinating all the tasks in UniAD requires extensive computational resources, so making it more lightweight is an important direction. This could involve things like model compression techniques or more efficient model architectures.

- Incorporating additional tasks like depth estimation and behavior prediction into the UniAD framework. The authors mention that deciding which tasks to include and how to integrate them is an open question worth exploring further. 

- Transferring UniAD to real-world driving scenarios beyond just simulation benchmarks. The paper focuses on results on the nuScenes dataset, but testing the approach in real on-road environments is important future work.

- Handling more long-tail driving scenarios. The authors show some failure cases dealing with unusual vehicles like large trucks and trailers. Improving the robustness of UniAD to more diverse and rare situations is suggested.

- Exploring different system-level designs beyond the exact UniAD framework. While UniAD proposes one approach to joint perception, prediction and planning, the authors suggest further research on architectural variations for end-to-end autonomous driving.

In summary, the key future directions focus on deployment to real vehicles, expanding the capabilities and robustness of the system, and further exploration of different task architectures and coordination mechanisms for end-to-end driving. The paper lays out an initial unified framework as a starting point for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD), a comprehensive end-to-end framework that incorporates multiple essential driving tasks including detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning. UniAD is designed in a planning-oriented spirit, where the choice and priority of preceding tasks are determined to facilitate planning of the self-driving vehicle. A key component is the query-based design connecting all modules, which provides flexible intermediate representations to exchange multi-task knowledge. UniAD leverages five tasks on the nuScenes benchmark and demonstrates superior performance over prior methods, reducing errors substantially in motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning. Extensive ablations verify the effectiveness of UniAD's planning-oriented philosophy and the necessity of effective task coordination towards the ultimate goal.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a comprehensive end-to-end autonomous driving system called UniAD that incorporates multiple essential driving tasks including tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and planning. The key motivation is to design the system in a planning-oriented manner, where preceding perception and prediction tasks are coordinated to facilitate the ultimate goal of safe planning. UniAD leverages a transformer-based architecture, where task-specific queries serve as interfaces to connect different modules and enable flexible feature exchange. For example, track queries are used for detection and tracking, map queries for online map segmentation, and motion queries for trajectory forecasting. These interpretable intermediate features are then utilized by the planning module to generate collision-free trajectories. 

The authors conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to validate the effectiveness of UniAD. They show that incorporating multiple coordinated sub-tasks leads to significant improvements in performance over standalone models or simple multi-task learning schemes. For instance, UniAD achieves state-of-the-art results on motion forecasting, reducing errors by over 60% compared to prior vision-based methods. It also demonstrates safer planning, cutting the collision rate by over 50%. The authors provide detailed ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component. The results highlight the importance of a unified planning-oriented design versus modular pipelines. Overall, UniAD represents an important step toward full-stack intelligent driving systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents UniAD, a unified autonomous driving framework that incorporates multiple tasks including perception, prediction, and planning within a single end-to-end model. The key component connecting the tasks is a query-based design, where each module takes sparse queries as input that encode information about agents, maps, goals, etc. For perception, TrackFormer detects and tracks objects using learnable track queries, while MapFormer performs online map segmentation using map queries. For prediction, MotionFormer forecasts future trajectories for all agents in a scene using the track and map queries, and OccFormer predicts future occupancy maps leveraging both agent queries and dense scene features. Finally, the planning module takes the ego-vehicle query from MotionFormer and predicted occupancy from OccFormer to output a safe trajectory for the ego vehicle. A core benefit of this query-based interface between modules is enabling flexible communication and interaction between the tasks toward the final goal of safe planning. The model is trained end-to-end, allowing the tasks to be jointly optimized. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate UniAD's state-of-the-art performance on perception, prediction, and planning compared to prior more fragmented approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem/question this paper is addressing are:

- The paper discusses the system-level design and task taxonomy for an autonomous driving algorithm framework. It focuses on how to effectively coordinate various driving tasks toward the ultimate goal of safe planning. 

- It argues that most current systems either deploy standalone models for each task independently, leading to error accumulation and lack of coordination, or simply stack tasks in a multi-task learning paradigm with negative transfer.

- Instead, it proposes that a favorable framework should be planning-oriented, incorporating essential preceding tasks with proper priority to facilitate planning. It raises the question - which tasks are requisite and how to design the pipeline in a planning-oriented spirit?

- To address this, the paper presents UniAD, an end-to-end system unifying key tasks in perception (detection, tracking, mapping) and prediction (motion forecasting, occupancy prediction) to provide interpretable intermediate representations for planning. 

- The key motivation is to investigate the necessity and effect of each module, leveraging their benefits toward planning in a unified algorithm framework, rather than optimizing each task independently. This requires effective task coordination instead of standalone or naive multi-task designs.

In summary, the core problem is how to design an autonomous driving system framework oriented toward the planning goal, by properly incorporating, prioritizing and coordinating essential preceding tasks like perception and prediction. The paper proposes the UniAD system following this planning-oriented philosophy to address the limitations of current modular or multi-task paradigms.
