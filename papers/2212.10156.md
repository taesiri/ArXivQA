# [Planning-oriented Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an end-to-end autonomous driving system that is optimized for planning performance. Specifically, the authors argue that rather than having separate models for perception, prediction, and planning tasks, it is better to have a unified model where all components are designed to facilitate planning. 

The key hypothesis is that by incorporating multiple essential driving tasks like detection, tracking, mapping, motion forecasting, and occupancy prediction into a single network, and connecting them through learned query interfaces, the system can achieve better planning performance compared to pipelines with standalone models or simple multi-task learning.

In summary, the main research question is: how should an end-to-end autonomous driving system be designed in a planning-oriented manner, with proper task coordination instead of standalone or naive multi-task learning schemes? The hypothesis is that the proposed Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD) framework with connected query-based interfaces can achieve superior planning performance.
