# [Large Language Model-Based Evolutionary Optimizer: Reasoning with   elitism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. This has sparked interest in using them as black-box optimizers across diverse problems like multi-objective optimization, high-dimensional problems etc. However, LLMs can sometimes hallucinate or get stuck in local optima. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel population-based LLM optimization method called Language-model-based Evolutionary Optimizer (LEO). 
- LEO uses an explore-exploit strategy with separate pools of solutions. The explore pool searches distant spaces while the exploit pool searches nearby regions. 
- An elitism criterion is used - only top solutions are retained at each step. This acts as a guardrail against LLM hallucinations.
- LEO is parameter-free and suitable for multi-objective optimization. It can also be incorporated into existing population-based methods like NSGA-II.

Key Contributions:
- First population-based LLM optimizer using explore-exploit strategy with elitism guardrails. Shows strong optimization capability across diverse problems.
- Demonstrates LLM reasoning ability via statistical tests on solution variance and comparison to a LLM random generator baseline. 
- Compares well with gradient-based and gradient-free state-of-the-art on benchmark problems. Also solves engineering problems like nozzle design, heat transfer and wind farm layout optimization.
- Provides guidelines to obtain reliable solutions from LLMs. Discusses limitations and future work around high-dimensional problems.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to harness LLM optimization capabilities using guardrails against hallucinations. The method competes well against state-of-the-art optimizers across a diverse set of problems.
