# [Glance and Focus: Memory Prompting for Multi-Event Video Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-event video question answering (VideoQA) requires reasoning across long videos depicting multiple human-object interactions, which is challenging. 
- Large cross-modal models struggle to establish correspondence between high-level event concepts in questions and lengthy, complex video content.

Proposed Solution - Glance-Focus Model
- Mimics human strategy of glancing through a story to get episode memories as context for reasoning. 
- Glancing Stage: Generates set of event memories from video using unsupervised or supervised approaches.
- Focusing Stage: Reorganizes event memories into memory prompts indicating temporal order. Uses multi-level cross attentions to focus first on relevant memory then video segment to answer question.  

Main Contributions:
- Proposes novel Glance-Focus strategy with memory prompting to bridge gap between questions and videos for efficient multi-event reasoning.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks. 
- Demonstrates effectiveness of generated event memories in locating question-relevant moments in lengthy videos.
- Requires no extra annotations for unsupervised memory generation, enabling extension to real-world datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is using descriptive event memories as intermediary anchors between questions and videos to effectively ground the semantics for complex multi-event reasoning in VideoQA. Both quantitative results and qualitative analyses validate the efficacy of this human-inspired Glance-Focus approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Glance-Focus model with two stages - glancing to generate a set of event memories from the video, and focusing to use those memories as anchors to establish correspondence between questions and video frames for multi-event video question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Glance-Focus model for multi-event video question answering. Specifically:

1) It introduces a Glancing stage to generate a set of dynamic event memories from the video to summarize key events occurring in the video. Both unsupervised and supervised methods are designed for memory generation.

2) It utilizes the generated event memories as prompts to help establish correspondence between questions involving high-level events and low-level video content. 

3) It designs a Focusing stage with multi-level cross attentions that can progressively focus on the relevant events and video segments guided by the questions and memory prompts.

4) Extensive experiments show the model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging multi-event VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key innovation is using generated event memories as intermediate anchors to bridge the gap between questions and videos for more efficient multi-event video reasoning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Multi-Event Video Question Answering (Multi-Event VideoQA): The task of answering questions about videos containing multiple human-object interactions and events.

- Glance-Focus model: The proposed two-stage model with glancing to generate event memories and focusing to localize question-relevant video content using those memories.  

- Event memories: The high-level compact representations of key events in the video generated by the model without supervision.

- Memory prompting: Using the generated event memories to establish correspondence between questions and videos.

- Unsupervised/supervised event extraction: Generating event memories without/with ground truth event annotations. 

- Multi-level cross attention: The attention mechanism in the focusing stage to first attend to relevant memories then video content.

- Transformer Encoder-Decoder: The backbone model architecture used in the glancing and focusing stages.

So in summary, the key ideas are using event memories to bridge the gap between questions and videos, and a two-stage reasoning process of glancing and focusing enabled by those memories.
