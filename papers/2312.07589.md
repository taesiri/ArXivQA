# [ConvD: Attention Enhanced Dynamic Convolutional Embeddings for Knowledge   Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness. Most existing knowledge graph embedding methods use external convolution kernels and traditional plain convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the models. Equally weighting each convolution kernel during convolution is also not reasonable. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model called ConvD for knowledge graph completion. The key ideas are:

1) Reshape the relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels to directly extract entity embedding features, improving feature interaction. 

2) Introduce an attention mechanism to compute correlations between entities and relations and construct adaptive dynamic convolution kernel weight vectors, with dimensionality consistent with the number of kernels. This assigns different contribution weights to the kernels.

3) Further optimize the attention mechanism using priori knowledge - constructing a 2D priority matrix based on entity-relation pair probabilities in the KG. This improves the rationality of capturing feature interactions.  

4) Use joint training with label smoothing and dropout to prevent overfitting.

Main Contributions:

- Propose ConvD model with relation-based dynamic convolution kernels and optimized attention to improve feature interaction and expressiveness for knowledge graph completion.

- Achieve superior performance over 25 state-of-the-art methods on FB15K-237 (11.3% avg improvement), WN18RR (12.16% avg improvement) and large-scale DB100K (16.92% avg improvement). 

- Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each ConvD module. Analyze impact of number of dynamic convolution kernels.

In summary, the paper focuses on enhancing feature interactions for knowledge graph embeddings, and proposes the ConvD model that uses dynamic convolution and optimized attention to achieve new state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using multiple internal convolution kernels constructed from relation embeddings rather than external convolution kernels. What is the intuition behind using internal kernels and how does it help enhance feature interaction capability?

2. The attention mechanism in ConvD assigns different weights to different convolution kernels. What motivates this design choice? How does the weighting of kernels impact model performance?

3. The priori knowledge matrix uses the frequency of entity-relation pairs in the KG to determine attention weights. What is the intuition behind using this statistical information? How sensitive is model performance to the choice of priori knowledge source?  

4. The paper argues that equal weighting of convolution kernels is unreasonable. What issues can arise from equally weighting kernels? How does dynamic weighting help address those issues?

5. ConvD uses a 1-N scoring function for training and prediction. What are the computational advantages of 1-N scoring versus separate scoring of each triple? How does it impact things like batch size and training time?

6. What motivated the inclusion of three separate dropout layers in ConvD? What overfitting problems could occur without dropout and how does each dropout layer help?

7. The internal convolution kernels in ConvD are relation-specific. What are the modeling limitations if kernels were shared across relations instead? When would relation-specific kernels be most beneficial?

8. The paper shows ConvD has strong performance on DB100K which has more relations than entities. Why does ConvD work well on relation-heavy KGs compared to other methods?

9. Without the attention mechanism, performance drops significantly on WN18RR. Why does attention have an outsized impact for datasets with low average in-degree relations?  

10. Could ConvD be extended to also allow entity-specific convolutions? What implementation challenges would that introduce and how could it improve representational power?
