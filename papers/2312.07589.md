# [ConvD: Attention Enhanced Dynamic Convolutional Embeddings for Knowledge   Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness. Most existing knowledge graph embedding methods use external convolution kernels and traditional plain convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the models. Equally weighting each convolution kernel during convolution is also not reasonable. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model called ConvD for knowledge graph completion. The key ideas are:

1) Reshape the relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels to directly extract entity embedding features, improving feature interaction. 

2) Introduce an attention mechanism to compute correlations between entities and relations and construct adaptive dynamic convolution kernel weight vectors, with dimensionality consistent with the number of kernels. This assigns different contribution weights to the kernels.

3) Further optimize the attention mechanism using priori knowledge - constructing a 2D priority matrix based on entity-relation pair probabilities in the KG. This improves the rationality of capturing feature interactions.  

4) Use joint training with label smoothing and dropout to prevent overfitting.

Main Contributions:

- Propose ConvD model with relation-based dynamic convolution kernels and optimized attention to improve feature interaction and expressiveness for knowledge graph completion.

- Achieve superior performance over 25 state-of-the-art methods on FB15K-237 (11.3% avg improvement), WN18RR (12.16% avg improvement) and large-scale DB100K (16.92% avg improvement). 

- Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each ConvD module. Analyze impact of number of dynamic convolution kernels.

In summary, the paper focuses on enhancing feature interactions for knowledge graph embeddings, and proposes the ConvD model that uses dynamic convolution and optimized attention to achieve new state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.
