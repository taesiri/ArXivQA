# [Event-aware Video Corpus Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video corpus moment retrieval (VCMR) is an important video retrieval task that aims to find a specific moment in a large corpus of untrimmed videos using a natural language query. 
- Existing VCMR methods rely on frame-level matching between query and video frames. However, this overlooks the semantic structure between frames, namely "events", which are crucial for human understanding of videos.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EventFormer, an event-aware VCMR model that explicitly utilizes events as the fundamental units for retrieval instead of individual frames.

- It has two main components:
   1) Event reasoning: Groups consecutive, visually similar frames into events using strategies like contrastive convolution.
   2) Hierarchical event encoding: Encodes information at both frame and event levels to capture interactions. Also uses anchor multi-head self-attention to focus on adjacent content.

- Two-branch contrastive learning and dual optimization are used to train the video retriever and moment localizer modules.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first event-aware model for VCMR, motivated by human perception.
- Introduces event reasoning and hierarchical encoding for effective event representation.
- Anchor multi-head self-attention encourages model to capture relevance of neighboring content.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple VCMR benchmarks.
- Validates model effectiveness on partially relevant video retrieval task.

In summary, the paper presents a novel event-based approach to improve video corpus moment retrieval by better capturing the semantic structures in videos. The proposed EventFormer model outperforms previous frame-based methods.
