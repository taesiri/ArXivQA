## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the paper:

- Developing efficient algorithms to handle non-smoothness both in the objectives and in the PDE constraints. The authors note that non-smoothness poses significant challenges for computing Pareto sets, which are infinite in general. Developing algorithms that can deal with non-smoothness efficiently would allow solving a wider range of real-world problems.

- Incorporating surrogate models for expensive PDEs and treating the resulting inexactness. The authors suggest reduced-order modeling techniques like reduced basis methods to replace expensive PDE evaluations with cheaper surrogate models. However, the inexactness introduced needs to be handled carefully.

- Extending the theory and methods for regularization paths and non-smooth continuation to broader classes of problems, like deep neural networks. The authors developed promising techniques for computing regularization paths for linear models, and suggest extending these to nonlinear models like neural networks.

- Applying multiobjective optimization more in machine learning contexts like training neural networks. The authors show applications in inverse optimization and regularization, and suggest multiobjective methods could improve performance in other machine learning areas.

- Further exploration of using mixed-integer techniques to reduce surrogate modeling effort in PDE-constrained optimization. The authors propose a novel technique to introduce discrete controls for more efficient data-driven surrogate modeling. Further developing this approach could lead to substantial gains.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: efficient algorithms for non-smooth problems, surrogate models for PDEs, extending theory/methods for regularization paths and continuation, more applications in machine learning, and further development of mixed-integer techniques. All these aim to extend the capabilities of multiobjective optimization methods for large-scale real-world problems.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an overview of recent developments in the field of multiobjective optimization of problems with partial differential equation (PDE) constraints that exhibit non-smoothness. Multiobjective optimization aims to simultaneously optimize multiple conflicting objectives, resulting in a set of optimal trade-off solutions called the Pareto set. Optimizing problems with PDE constraints is challenging since evaluating the objectives requires solving the PDEs, which can be computationally expensive. Adding non-smoothness, for example having the objectives be non-smooth functions or the PDEs contain non-smooth terms, poses further difficulties. 

The paper gives a background on multiobjective optimization and PDE-constrained optimization. It then discusses efficient algorithms that have been developed for non-smooth multiobjective optimization, both with and without PDE constraints. Topics covered include the use of surrogate models to reduce the cost of evaluating PDE constraints, applications in machine learning, and exploiting mixed-integer techniques to efficiently construct surrogate models for smooth PDE-constrained problems. Overall, the paper provides a good overview of recent work on extending multiobjective optimization to tackle problems incorporating non-smoothness and PDE constraints.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a framework called QuaSiModO (Quantization, Simulation, Modeling, Optimization) for model predictive control of complex dynamical systems using data-driven surrogate models. The key ideas are:

1) Quantize the continuous control input set into a finite discrete set. This allows simulating the system autonomously for each discrete input. 

2) Use the autonomous simulation data to build surrogate models for each discrete input value. This avoids the more challenging task of building a surrogate model that takes the control input as a variable. Any suitable data-driven modeling technique can be used.

3) Relax the discrete optimization to a continuous convex combination of the surrogate models. This yields a continuous optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. 

4) Map the continuous optimal control back to a discrete control input using e.g. sum up rounding. Apply this control to the real system.

By transforming the problem in this way, arbitrary off-the-shelf data-driven modeling techniques can be readily used for control of complex systems. Existing error bounds for the surrogate models can also be incorporated to provide guarantees on controller performance.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multiobjective optimization - The paper focuses on methods for solving optimization problems with multiple, conflicting objectives. 

- Pareto optimality - A solution is Pareto optimal (non-dominated) if no other solution exists that improves one objective without worsening another. The goal is to find the Pareto set of all Pareto optimal solutions.

- Descent methods - Algorithmic approaches that generate a sequence of improving solutions. A key section describes a descent method for general non-smooth multiobjective problems.

- Regularization - Adding a penalty term to an optimization problem to promote certain properties like sparsity. The paper discusses regularization paths and continuation methods.

- Machine learning - Applications at the intersection of multiobjective optimization and machine learning are discussed, including inverse optimization and regularization in deep learning.

- PDE constraints - Several sections focus on multiobjective optimization problems where the objectives involve computationally expensive PDE solutions. Surrogate modeling helps accelerate these.

- Non-smoothness - Both non-smooth objectives and non-smooth PDE constraints are considered. Optimality conditions and algorithms are adapted to handle the lack of differentiability.

- Mixed-integer techniques - The paper introduces an approach to integrate discrete/integer controls into otherwise smooth PDE-constrained problems to enable efficient data-driven surrogate modeling.
