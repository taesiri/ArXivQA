# [Deep-Dispatch: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Vehicle Dispatch   Algorithm for Advanced Air Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10809)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of optimal dispatch of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft fleets for advanced air mobility (AAM) passenger transportation services. Key challenges in eVTOL dispatch include frequent need for recharging due to limited battery capacity, limited number of takeoff/landing pads at vertiports, and time-varying passenger demand and electricity prices. Existing optimization models for this problem have prohibitively high computational times.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithms to solve the eVTOL dispatch problem - a single-agent DQL where one agent controls the entire fleet, and a multi-agent DQL where each aircraft is controlled by an independent agent. The objective is to maximize operating profit by optimally dispatching aircraft to transport passengers and for recharging. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and deep Q-learning is used by the agent(s) to learn the optimal dispatch policy.

Key Contributions:

- Formulation of single and multi-agent DRL algorithms for eVTOL dispatch while accounting for key practical operational constraints like limited vertiport capacity and eVTOL battery capacity  

- Development of an AAM passenger transportation simulation environment using estimated passenger demand and real-world electricity price data

- Comparative assessment of algorithms over 36 test cases with varying fleet sizes, number of vertiports and demand blocks. 

- The multi-agent algorithm achieved near optimal solutions with average optimality gap of only 1.75% and significantly lower computational time compared to optimization model

- Multi-agent algorithm outperformed single-agent one in terms of profit generated and training time

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in developing DRL based algorithms for eVTOL dispatch for AAM that can effectively deal with key practical operational challenges. The multi-agent DRL algorithm in particular shows strong performance in quality of solutions and computational expense compared to benchmarks.
