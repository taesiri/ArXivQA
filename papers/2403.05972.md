# [C3D: Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman   Learning for Autonomous Surface Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) face challenges operating robustly in complex and dynamic environments, especially when subjected to unanticipated damage or changes in dynamics.
- Methods like adaptive control and disturbance rejection have limitations dealing with significant, unmodeled changes.
- Rapid transfer of autonomy across platforms requires generalizable approaches that can enable online learning and relearning.

Proposed Solution:
- A new control framework called Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman Learning (C3D) is proposed. It has 3 key components:
  1) Deep Koopman Learning: Learns a global linear representation of the nonlinear system dynamics. Allows easy retraining to capture changes.
  2) Change Point Detector: Detects shifts in dynamics requiring model retraining.
  3) Cascaded LQR Control: Outer loop generates velocity/yaw references, inner loop tracks them using LQR on Koopman model.

- Evaluated on an underactuated WAM-V vehicle in simulation and real-world experiments. Various system changes applied like reduced motor efficiency, added mass, trim changes.

Key Contributions:
- Novel C3D framework enabling adaptation to significant unmodeled changes in ASVs.
- Deep Koopman learning for efficient retraining of altered dynamics.
- Change point detection to trigger retraining of Koopman model.  
- Demonstrated Sim2Real transfer of approach on underactuated vehicle.
- Show 13.9%+ improvement vs no change accommodation methods in station keeping.
- Consistently achieves <1.9m position error and <12.8Â° heading error after retraining.

In summary, the paper proposes an integrated learning control strategy to enable ASVs to robustly adapt to and counteract significant changes in dynamics during deployment. Evaluations verify improved resilience versus alternate methods.
