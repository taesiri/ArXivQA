# [C3D: Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman   Learning for Autonomous Surface Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) face challenges operating robustly in complex and dynamic environments, especially when subjected to unanticipated damage or changes in dynamics.
- Methods like adaptive control and disturbance rejection have limitations dealing with significant, unmodeled changes.
- Rapid transfer of autonomy across platforms requires generalizable approaches that can enable online learning and relearning.

Proposed Solution:
- A new control framework called Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman Learning (C3D) is proposed. It has 3 key components:
  1) Deep Koopman Learning: Learns a global linear representation of the nonlinear system dynamics. Allows easy retraining to capture changes.
  2) Change Point Detector: Detects shifts in dynamics requiring model retraining.
  3) Cascaded LQR Control: Outer loop generates velocity/yaw references, inner loop tracks them using LQR on Koopman model.

- Evaluated on an underactuated WAM-V vehicle in simulation and real-world experiments. Various system changes applied like reduced motor efficiency, added mass, trim changes.

Key Contributions:
- Novel C3D framework enabling adaptation to significant unmodeled changes in ASVs.
- Deep Koopman learning for efficient retraining of altered dynamics.
- Change point detection to trigger retraining of Koopman model.  
- Demonstrated Sim2Real transfer of approach on underactuated vehicle.
- Show 13.9%+ improvement vs no change accommodation methods in station keeping.
- Consistently achieves <1.9m position error and <12.8Â° heading error after retraining.

In summary, the paper proposes an integrated learning control strategy to enable ASVs to robustly adapt to and counteract significant changes in dynamics during deployment. Evaluations verify improved resilience versus alternate methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a framework called C3D (Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman Learning) for robust control of autonomous surface vehicles, using a change point detector to trigger online retraining of a deep Koopman model and a cascaded optimal controller based on the updated model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new control framework called C3D (Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman Learning) for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Specifically:

1) It uses a deep Koopman learner to obtain a linear representation of the ASV's nonlinear dynamics. This allows the use of linear optimal control techniques. The deep Koopman model can also be quickly retrained online to adapt to changes in the ASV's dynamics.

2) It incorporates an online change point detection algorithm to detect shifts in the ASV's dynamics and trigger retraining of the deep Koopman model when needed.

3) It implements a cascade control strategy, with an outer loop for waypoint navigation based on known kinematics and an inner loop using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based on the deep Koopman model to track velocity/yaw rate references.

4) It demonstrates the C3D framework in simulation and field experiments for station keeping control of an ASV under various system changes like loss of propulsion, change in trim/rudder angles, and addition of loads. The C3D controller outperforms PID and nominal C3D control in tracking accuracy.

So in summary, the key contribution is the design and experimental validation of the C3D architecture for adaptive control of ASVs under complex dynamic changes.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a composite online change point detection (CPD) algorithm. What are the two components of this algorithm and how do they complement each other? What are the limitations of only using one vs using both?

2) The cascade control framework uses a deep Koopman learner to model system dynamics. What are the benefits of using a Koopman model compared to other model choices? How does the deep learning aspect help address limitations of traditional Koopman methods?

3) What excitation signal is used for collecting training data for the deep Koopman model? What properties make this a good choice compared to alternatives? How are the parameters of this signal tuned?

4) The paper leverages ideas from classical system ID techniques. What aspects of classical system ID influenced the design of the excitation signal and training procedure? How does the approach here differ?  

5) The cascade control framework couples the deep Koopman model with an LQR controller. Why is LQR a natural fit for controlling the Koopman model? What modifications were made to the standard LQR approach and why?

6) The outer-loop controller handles the vehicle's non-holonomic constraints using a Lyapunov-based design. What is the intuition behind the switched logic based on distance to target? How does this approach overcome limitations due to underactuation?

7) What modifications were made in simulation to better match dynamics of the real platform? What sensor noises and delays were modeled and why are these important to include?

8) What was the motivation behind using a backseat-frontseat architecture in the real-world deployment? What specific advantages does this modular design provide?

9) How much field testing was conducted with the real platform? What were some of the major challenges faced in transitioning the autonomy solution from simulation to the real world?

10) The paper demonstrated success across different system changes in both simulation and field testing. What additional capabilities would need to be incorporated to handle more complex damage scenarios?
