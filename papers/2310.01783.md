# [Can large language models provide useful feedback on research papers? A   large-scale empirical analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01783)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: 

Can large language models provide useful feedback on research papers? The authors aim to evaluate the quality and utility of feedback generated by the GPT-4 large language model on scientific papers.

Specifically, the key hypothesis seems to be that large language model generated feedback can be helpful for researchers, especially when timely expert feedback is not readily available. The authors test this through a large-scale analysis involving:

1) A retrospective comparison of GPT-4 generated feedback versus human peer reviewer feedback on over 3,000 papers from Nature journals and over 1,700 papers from the ICLR conference. 

2) A prospective user study surveying over 300 researchers on their perceptions of GPT-4 generated feedback on their own papers.

The central goal is to systematically characterize and quantify the reliability, credibility, and limitations of leveraging large language models like GPT-4 to provide automated scientific feedback. The authors aim to shed light on whether and how LLM-generated feedback could complement human feedback to aid researchers.

In summary, the key research question is whether large language models can provide useful feedback on research papers, which is tested through quantitative evaluations and user studies comparing LLM-generated feedback to human expert feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Developing an automated pipeline using GPT-4 to generate structured feedback on full PDFs of scientific papers. The feedback covers key aspects like significance, reasons for acceptance/rejection, and suggestions for improvement.

- Conducting a large-scale retrospective analysis to compare GPT-4 generated feedback to human peer reviewer feedback on over 3,000 Nature journal papers and 1,700 ICLR papers. The analysis finds considerable overlap between GPT-4 and human feedback.

- Performing a prospective user study with over 300 researchers to get their perspectives on the usefulness and limitations of the GPT-4 generated feedback on their own papers. The majority found the LLM feedback helpful.

- Providing one of the first large-scale systematic assessments on using LLMs like GPT-4 to facilitate scientific feedback, complementing human peer review. The results suggest LLM feedback could help researchers, especially when timely expert feedback is unavailable, while noting limitations like generating less concrete/actionable feedback.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive empirical analysis, through both retrospective evaluation and a prospective user study, demonstrating the promises and current limitations of leveraging large language models to provide helpful scientific feedback on research papers. The work sheds light on how LLMs could augment human feedback.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The paper takes a large-scale empirical approach to evaluating the usefulness of LLM-generated feedback on scientific papers. This is a more comprehensive analysis than previous small-scale exploratory studies on using LLMs for scientific feedback. The large datasets and incorporation of user perspectives help better characterize the reliability and acceptability of the approach.

- The paper introduces a novel pipeline for generating structured LLM feedback on full paper PDFs. It is more sophisticated than prior attempts at leveraging LLMs for error checking or very basic feedback. The pipeline mirrors common aspects of human peer review, allowing for a robust comparison.

- The analysis goes beyond qualitative results to provide quantitative assessment of overlap with human feedback. This systematic evaluation of overlap and user perceptions yields insights not seen in prior exploratory works. It enables a data-driven characterization of the strengths and weaknesses.

- The paper evaluates LLM feedback across different disciplines (basic sciences, AI/ML) and venues (journals vs conferences), capturing variations. Many existing studies focus narrowly on a single field like computer science.  

- The work hypothesizes complementary benefits of LLM and human feedback. It does not claim full automation, but rather aims to augment human review. This nuanced perspective sets it apart from studies that focus solely on reproducing peer review.

Overall, the large-scale quantitative analysis and the focus on augmenting human feedback make this paper a more comprehensive contribution to understanding the utility of LLMs for scientific evaluation. The evaluation across disciplines and integration of user perspectives also help advance knowledge in this emerging area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest a few key future research directions:

- Investigating the performance and limitations of the proposed approach on a wider range of scientific papers, including those in other languages and disciplines beyond computer science and biology.

- Exploring ways to make the LLM-generated feedback more concrete, specific, and actionable, such as nudging the model to suggest missing experiments or analyses.

- Incorporating auxiliary modules into the system to allow comprehension and critique of tables, figures, and other visual elements in scientific papers.

- Utilizing labeled datasets of high-quality expert reviews to further fine-tune the LLM's abilities for scientific feedback generation through supervised learning.

- Studying the potential of the approach for aiding in error detection and correction by introducing different error types into papers and evaluating the system's ability to identify and rectify them.

- Expanding the framework to support peer review workflows, such as automating screening, checklist verification, and quality assessment of submissions.

- Investigating human-AI collaboration in which both human experts and LLMs provide scientific feedback to combine their complementary strengths.

- Evaluating the promise of scientific feedback generation systems to help democratize access to high-quality feedback, particularly for under-resourced researchers.

Overall, the authors highlight exciting opportunities to build on their work to create more robust, accurate, and comprehensive LLM-based systems for enhancing scientific evaluation and feedback.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper presents a large-scale empirical analysis characterizing the potential reliability and credibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating scientific feedback on research manuscripts. The authors developed a GPT-4 pipeline to generate structured feedback on the full PDFs of papers, focusing on key aspects like significance, reasons for acceptance/rejection, and suggestions for improvement. They evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated feedback through retrospective analysis on papers from Nature journals and ICLR conferences, comparing it to actual human reviewer feedback. The results showed substantial overlap between points raised by the LLM versus human reviewers, comparable to the overlap between two human reviewers. The authors also conducted a prospective user study surveying 308 researchers in AI/computational biology fields on their perceptions of LLM feedback on their own papers. Overall, a majority found the LLM feedback helpful and aligned with what human reviewers would raise. However, limitations were noted regarding ability to provide concrete critiques. 

In summary, this work provides a comprehensive empirical analysis on utilizing LLMs to generate scientific feedback. The findings suggest LLMs can produce helpful comments that overlap with human feedback, demonstrating their potential to aid researchers. But human expert feedback remains essential for rigorous review. LLMs exhibit biases and struggle with nuanced critique, though future work on nudging LLMs and incorporating expert knowledge could address these weaknesses. The study highlights promising avenues for LLMs to facilitate scholarly communication while underscoring the continued importance of human intelligence.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main method can be summarized as follows in one paragraph:

The paper proposes a new framework for multi-modal fusion called Latent Alignment Network (LAN) to align and fuse features from different modalities at both channel-level and instance-level. At the channel-level, LAN utilizes a modality adaptation module and channel shuffled cross-modal interactions to align the feature distributions across modalities in the latent space. At the instance-level, LAN employs a cross-modal affinity learning branch to learn semantic affinities between instances of different modalities for more fine-grained fusion. Specifically, the affinity learning branch takes concatenated features from two modalities as input, and applies channel shuffling followed by channel-wise attention to model cross-modal correlations. The final fused features are obtained by aggregating the aligned channel features and weighted instance features based on the learned affinities. The framework is evaluated on various multi-modal tasks including multi-modal retrieval and classification. Experiments show that LAN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by effectively aligning and fusing multi-modal features at both channel and instance level.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem or question being addressed is:

How to leverage large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to generate helpful, high-quality feedback on academic research papers, and whether such AI-generated feedback can effectively supplement or aid the traditional peer review process. 

Specifically, the paper aims to:

- Develop an automated pipeline using GPT-4 that can take a research paper PDF as input and generate structured feedback on aspects like significance, reasons for acceptance/rejection, and suggestions for improvement.

- Evaluate the quality and usefulness of the LLM-generated feedback through large-scale quantitative studies comparing it to human peer reviewer comments on thousands of papers.

- Assess researcher perspectives on the LLM-generated feedback through a prospective user study surveying over 300 researchers who evaluated feedback on their own papers. 

- Understand the reliability, limitations, and acceptability of using LLMs to provide scientific feedback, and how it compares to traditional human peer review.

- Explore whether LLM-generated feedback could be a valuable supplement for researchers, especially those lacking access to timely quality feedback via traditional peer review.

So in summary, it is studying whether and how the latest advances in large language model AI could be applied to enhance and augment the critical process of providing high-quality feedback on academic research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method for adversarial training called FreeLB. Could you explain in more detail how the free adversarial perturbation forces the model to learn more robust features? How is this approach superior to prior adversarial training methods?

2. The paper shows improved robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using FreeLB. Have you evaluated the approach on additional datasets beyond these two? Are there certain types of datasets or tasks where you would expect FreeLB to perform better or worse?

3. The paper argues FreeLB enhances model robustness while maintaining standard accuracy. However, there is often a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy. Under what circumstances would you expect FreeLB to degrade standard accuracy? How could the method be adapted to balance robustness and accuracy?

4. The paper focuses on image classification tasks. How suitable do you think FreeLB would be for other types of tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc? Would any modifications need to be made to apply it effectively to these other domains?

5. How does the computational overhead of FreeLB during training compare to prior adversarial training methods? Does it add substantially more compute burden or is it relatively efficient?

6. The paper generates adversarial examples using the PGD attack method. How sensitive is FreeLB to the specific attack method used? Have you experimented with other attack types and how does the performance vary? 

7. You mentioned FreeLB is compatible with other defense methods like TRADES. Are there certain defense methods that you hypothesize would not be compatible or work well with FreeLB? Why?

8. The paper evaluates robustness using primarily the PGD adversary. To ensure the robustness is not specific to PGD, what other different adversarial attack methods could you test against?

9. You propose a new theoretical framework for analyzing FreeLB. Are there other theoretical analyses that could provide additional insights into why and how FreeLB provides enhanced robustness?

10. The paper focuses on adversarial robustness. Could FreeLB be extended to provide robustness against other types of common image corruptions besides adversarial perturbations? If so, how might you adapt the approach?
