# [Monte Carlo Tree Search in the Presence of Transition Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Monte Carlo Tree Search in the Presence of Transition Uncertainty":

Problem:
The paper studies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in the setting where the environment model used for planning is imperfect or inaccurate. Standard MCTS relies on a perfect model of the environment for its simulation-based search. However, in many practical applications only an imperfect approximate model is available. Using such inaccurate models with standard MCTS can lead to severe performance degradation.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Uncertainty Adapted MCTS (UA-MCTS) to address this problem. The key idea is to estimate the uncertainty or inaccuracy of the imperfect model during interactions with the real environment. This uncertainty estimate is then used to guide the different components of MCTS - selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation - to focus the search on more certain parts of the state space. For example, the selection phase uses a modified UCT formula that downweights the exploration term for highly uncertain states.

Key Contributions:

- Formalizes the problem setting of having an imperfect model for MCTS planning
- Develops UA-MCTS algorithm that adapts all components of MCTS using learned uncertainty
- Proves useful theoretical properties like completeness for the modified UCT selection
- Demonstrates UA-MCTS consistently outperforms standard MCTS with inaccurate models
- Shows that learning an uncertainty model is simpler than directly learning to improve the inaccurate transition model
- Evaluates UA-MCTS on modified MinAtar environments under different uncertainty settings

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in adapting MCTS to effectively handle model uncertainty, which is an important practical problem. The proposed UA-MCTS method guides the search to focus on more reliable parts of the imperfect model, thereby recovering strong performance compared to standard MCTS baselines.
