# [Explain Variance of Prediction in Variational Time Series Models for   Clinical Deterioration Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In healthcare applications, explainability of deep learning model predictions is crucial for trust and adoption. However, only explaining the predicted risk scores is not enough - explaining the variance of predictions also provides valuable insights for clinical decision making. 

- Traditional approaches train separate models for different prediction targets (e.g. risk, variance), leading to inconsistent explanations. Using a single model for all tasks is better.

- For sequential prediction tasks like patient deterioration, variational time series models are a natural fit as they can perform joint modeling and provide uncertainty estimates.

Proposed Solution:
- Use variational recurrent networks for deterioriation prediction. Approximate variance of predictions deterministically using delta's method rather than sampling. 

- Wrap the model to output variance. Apply SHAP for variance explanation by treating it as a separate variance game.

- Study relationship between measurement intervals of variables and their contribution to prediction variance using SHAP.

Main Contributions:

- Propose Variance SHAP to explain prediction variance in variational models by constructing a deterministic variance game.

- Discover patterns relating variable measurement intervals and variance contributions - most variables follow expected behavior but abnormalities exist. 

- Provide method to potentially guide frequencies of clinical variable measurement based on their variance contributions.

- Show variational time series models balance predictive power and explainability for clinical sequential prediction problems.

In summary, the paper introduces Variance SHAP to explain prediction variance in variational time series models, with applications in determining clinical variable measurement frequencies.
