# [A Self-Commissioning Edge Computing Method for Data-Driven Anomaly   Detection in Power Electronic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02661)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for online training of neural networks using streaming data that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. The key idea is to prioritize storing training samples in a fixed-size buffer based on prediction error, rather than recency. Samples with higher errors, indicating more relevant information, replace those with lower errors. This focuses learning on the model's largest mispredictions. Experiments use real converter data to train models predicting heat sink temperature from currents. The proposed sample selection method trains 2-3x faster than buffering alone and achieves much higher anomaly detection accuracy in detecting cooling issues, nearing offline model performance. Compared to state-of-the-art continual learning methods like iCaRL, EWC, and LwF, the proposed approach achieves better accuracy with lower computation and equal memory. Overall, this method enables fast and stable online neural network training for anomaly detection on resource-constrained platforms, using minimal system knowledge. Self-commissioning condition monitoring is enabled by the online threshold tuning. The conversion device application showcases the benefits for adaptable real-time learning in power electronics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents an edge computing method for online anomaly detection in power electronic systems, employing autonomous algorithm that prioritizes storage of training samples with larger prediction errors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks trained with streaming data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for online training of neural network models to improve anomaly detection in power electronic systems. Specifically:

- The paper proposes an algorithm that selects the most informative samples to keep in the training buffer during online training. This is done by replacing the sample with the lowest prediction error with each new observation. 

- This method improves training speed, stability, and anomaly detection accuracy compared to standard approaches like training incrementally or using a first-in-first-out training buffer.

- The algorithm is demonstrated on detecting thermal anomalies in a variable frequency drive by training a neural network online to predict heat sink temperature. Without needing extensive offline training data, the model learns to distinguish normal and anomalous operation.

- The proposed online training method achieves the closest performance to offline training methods, while having low memory requirements suitable for implementation on edge devices. This enables self-commissioning condition monitoring without reliance on cloud platforms.

In summary, the key contribution is a sample selection algorithm to improve online neural network training for anomaly detection applications, with experimental validation on a power electronics case study. The method is suitable for edge devices and requires minimal prior system knowledge.
