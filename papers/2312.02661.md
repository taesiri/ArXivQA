## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for online training of neural networks using streaming data that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. The key idea is to prioritize storing training samples in a fixed-size buffer based on prediction error, rather than recency. Samples with higher errors, indicating more relevant information, replace those with lower errors. This focuses learning on the model's largest mispredictions. Experiments use real converter data to train models predicting heat sink temperature from currents. The proposed sample selection method trains 2-3x faster than buffering alone and achieves much higher anomaly detection accuracy in detecting cooling issues, nearing offline model performance. Compared to state-of-the-art continual learning methods like iCaRL, EWC, and LwF, the proposed approach achieves better accuracy with lower computation and equal memory. Overall, this method enables fast and stable online neural network training for anomaly detection on resource-constrained platforms, using minimal system knowledge. Self-commissioning condition monitoring is enabled by the online threshold tuning. The conversion device application showcases the benefits for adaptable real-time learning in power electronics.
