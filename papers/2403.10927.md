## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Using UAVs with mobile edge computing (MEC) capabilities to assist terrestrial networks is gaining interest, but existing solutions rely on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL), which fail in dynamic environments where the statistics of task production and wireless channels are unknown.
- The joint trajectory planning and computational offloading scheduling problem for UAV-assisted MEC amounts to a sequential decision making problem under multiple objectives of minimizing energy consumption and task backlog.

Proposed Solution:
- A distributed multi-objective RL approach is proposed that consists of multiple agents (UAV + terrestrial users) making decentralized actions but sharing a global state observation. 
- A kernel-based method is used to approximate the action-value functions, which allows efficiently adding new features. An n-step return is used to smooth reward fluctuations.  
- Compared to a deep neural network baseline, the kernel method combined with n-step return achieves lower task backlog, faster learning, and reduced fluctuations.

Main Contributions:
- Novel distributed multi-objective RL formulation for joint trajectory and offloading problems in UAV-assisted MEC
- Integration of kernel method and n-step returns to address curse of dimensionality and smooth fluctuations
- Demonstrated performance gains over deep neural network baseline in terms of task backlog, learning speed, and stability
- Analysis of impact of different reward weights and illustration of learned UAV trajectories adapting to spatial distribution of terrestrial users

In summary, this paper proposes an efficient multi-agent multi-objective RL approach for dynamic management of UAV-assisted MEC networks, with demonstrations of performance gains compared to alternative techniques. The main impact is enabling stable and efficient operation of UAV-MEC networks in uncertain environments.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a distributed multi-objective reinforcement learning approach integrating the kernel method and n-step return to dynamically optimize the trajectory planning and offloading scheduling policies for an unmanned aerial vehicle assisting a terrestrial base station in mobile edge computing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) based trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme for air-ground collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC). The scheme aims to minimize the long-term average energy consumption and backlog of task bits.

2) It develops a distributed structure to address the curses of dimensionality caused by multiple user equipments (UEs), where each UE and UAV makes decentralized decisions. 

3) It integrates the kernel method with MORL to approximate the action-values, which can adaptively add more features to improve approximation accuracy.

4) It applies the n-step return method to average the fluctuations in the backlog performance. This is shown to achieve significant gains compared to conventional 1-step return.

5) Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernel-based MORL scheme compared to a deep neural network baseline, in terms of backlog performance, energy efficiency, and decision-making time. The scheme is also shown to enable online trajectory optimization for the UAV.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning approach customized for air-ground collaborative MEC scenarios, which outperforms existing schemes. The kernel method and n-step return design lead to key performance gains.
