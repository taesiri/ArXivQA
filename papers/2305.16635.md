# [Impossible Distillation: from Low-Quality Model to High-Quality Dataset   &amp; Model for Summarization and Paraphrasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether language models can learn to summarize and paraphrase sentences without requiring massive scale, instruction data, or human feedback. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that small, off-the-shelf language models possess latent knowledge about these tasks, even if the models themselves cannot reliably solve the tasks. The paper proposes that this latent knowledge can be identified and amplified into a high-quality dataset and task-specific model, allowing efficient and effective training without the typical resources used for unsupervised summarization and paraphrasing.

In summary, the central research question is whether task-specific models for summarization and paraphrasing can be distilled from small language models, without scale or supervision. The hypothesis is that small LMs contain latent knowledge that can be extracted and amplified to create high-quality datasets and models for these tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new framework called Impossible Distillation that can distill a high-quality task-specific dataset and model from an off-the-shelf language model, without requiring large scale or human supervision. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Generating candidate input-output pairs for a task (e.g. summarization) directly from a pre-trained LM using constrained decoding strategies.

2) Filtering high-quality pairs using task-specific filters based on entailment, length, diversity etc. 

3) Using the generated dataset to train an initial task model, then further amplifying its capability via self-distillation.

The end result is a compact yet powerful model that can outperform much larger LMs like GPT-3 on summarization and paraphrasing, as demonstrated through both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

Additionally, the framework produces a large high-quality dataset as a byproduct, which exhibits more diversity and effectiveness than human-authored datasets based on their analysis.

Overall, the key novelty seems to be distilling task knowledge directly from a pre-trained LM into a dataset and model without relying on scale or supervision, while achieving strong performance. The proposed framework and analysis around the dataset quality are the main contributions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The approach of distilling task knowledge directly from an off-the-shelf language model, without large-scale training or human supervision, is quite novel. Most prior work on unsupervised summarization/paraphrasing relies on task-specific losses or human-written instruction data. This paper shows such specialized resources may not be necessary.

- The idea of constraining language model decoding to generate candidate pairs, then filtering with separate criteria, is clever. This avoids having to fine-tune the model directly for the tasks. Similar ideas have been explored for commonsense reasoning, but not as much for text generation.

- Demonstrating strong performance by a 770M parameter model, surpassing 175B GPT-3, is impressive. It suggests that model scale alone does not determine summarization/paraphrasing capability; the distillation process matters. Comparisons to models 20x-200x larger are not frequently shown.

- Analyzing the diversity and usefulness of the generated dataset is novel. Most work evaluates the end model rather than the data itself. The analyses show advantages over human-written datasets in terms of diversity and applicability to new domains.

- Overall, the paper makes excellent contributions in showing how we can unlock latent knowledge in standard LMs, without scale or supervision. The distillation framework is general and the analyses shed light on properties of synthetic vs human datasets. I would say this paper significantly pushes forward the state of the art in task-oriented language model distillation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying Impossible Distillation to a broader range of tasks beyond sentence summarization and paraphrasing, such as translation. The authors suggest generating a parallel corpus for translation by leveraging multilingual LMs and cross-lingual evaluation metrics.

- Adapting Impossible Distillation for longer input-output pairs, like paragraph-level summarization. The authors propose a strategy of first generating the input article, then sequentially generating zero-shot summaries with a fixed separator.

- Generalizing Impossible Distillation to more complex tasks like commonsense reasoning, where defining high-quality examples is non-trivial. The authors suggest co-evolving the task model and filter model throughout the distillation stages. 

- Incorporating techniques for automatic bias detection and reduction into Impossible Distillation, to allow for safer knowledge transfer between language models.

- Releasing code and models to allow for further research and application of Impossible Distillation.

In summary, the main future directions focus on extending Impossible Distillation to new tasks and settings, adapting it to longer texts, improving the filtering process, mitigating risks, and sharing resources to enable further research. The authors frame Impossible Distillation as a promising and reusable framework for distilling knowledge from language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Impossible Distillation that can distill a high-quality dataset and model for sentence summarization and paraphrasing, without relying on large-scale models, human annotations, or task-specific supervision. The key idea is to first generate candidate input-output pairs from a small, off-the-shelf language model using constrained decoding techniques. The pairs are then filtered to only keep high-quality examples based on entailment, length, and diversity criteria. The resulting synthetic dataset is used to train an initial student model, which is further improved through self-distillation on additional generated pairs. Experiments show this approach can yield a 770M parameter model that outperforms the much larger 175B parameter GPT-3 on quality and controllability. A key advantage is that the distilled model and dataset can be produced without scale or supervision. The 3.4M sample dataset called DimSum+ is more diverse and effective than human-authored datasets. Overall, this work demonstrates how small LMs can be harnessed to distill high-quality task knowledge, without relying on their own capability to solve the task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a novel framework called Impossible Distillation that can distill a high-quality dataset and model for summarization and paraphrasing from an off-the-shelf language model, without the need for large scale or supervision. The key idea is to generate candidate input-output pairs from the language model using constrained decoding techniques, then filter high-quality examples using task-specific criteria. The resulting dataset can be used to train a student model which is further improved via self-distillation. Experiments show this approach can yield a 770M parameter model that outperforms the much larger 175B parameter GPT-3 on summarization and paraphrasing quality and controllability. The framework also produces a 3.4M pair dataset called DimSum+ that is more diverse and effective than human-authored datasets like Gigaword.

Paragraph 2: The Impossible Distillation framework operates in two stages. First is decoding-guided distillation where candidate input-output pairs are generated from an off-the-shelf LM using contextual and lexical constraints. Task-specific filters are applied to extract a high-quality dataset which is used to train an initial student model. The second stage is self-distillation where the student model generates more pairs that are filtered and used to further improve it. By iterating this generate-filter-train loop, the framework produces an increasingly stronger dataset and task model without external supervision. The resulting 770M parameter T5-based model outperforms even 175B parameter GPT-3 on summarization and paraphrasing due to the precise distillation of knowledge from smaller LMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Impossible Distillation, a novel framework that can distill a high-quality dataset and model for summarization and paraphrasing tasks directly from an off-the-shelf language model, without requiring large scale or human supervision. The key idea is to use constrained decoding strategies to generate a large pool of candidate input-output pairs from the language model, then filter down to high-quality examples using task-specific filters based on entailment, length, and diversity metrics. The filtered dataset is used to train an initial student model, which is further improved through self-distillation - using the student model's own generations for additional training data. By iterating this generate-filter-train loop, Impossible Distillation produces a powerful task-specific model and dataset from a standard language model, outperforming even massive models like GPT-3. A key advantage is the method's independence from large models or human supervision, enabling distillation from any off-the-shelf LM into specialized tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key points from the paper are:

- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities for tasks like summarization and paraphrasing when prompted with instructions, but training them requires massive scale, human feedback, and instruction data.

- The authors propose a novel framework called "Impossible Distillation" that can enable smaller, off-the-shelf LMs to perform these specialized tasks without needing scale or supervision. 

- The key ideas are:

1) Directly generating a task-specific dataset from an off-the-shelf LM using constrained decoding and filtering.

2) Distilling a student model on this generated dataset. 

3) Amplifying capability through self-distillation.

- Using this framework, they are able to distill a 770M parameter model that outperforms the much larger 175B parameter GPT-3 on summarization/paraphrasing quality and controllability.

- As a byproduct, they obtain a high-quality dataset of 3.4M sentence summary/paraphrase pairs, which is more diverse and effective than human-authored datasets.

In summary, the key problem is training specialized LM capabilities like summarization without massive scale or human supervision. The paper proposes a novel distillation framework to amplify task knowledge from smaller, off-the-shelf LMs to achieve strong performance.
