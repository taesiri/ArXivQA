# [Learning Human-Human Interactions in Images from Weak Textual   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14104)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we model the diverse and heavy tail of possible human-human interactions from images using only weak supervision from textual captions?

More specifically, the key points are:

- Prior works have treated human-human interactions (HHI) categorically, using a small fixed set of classes. But HHI are diverse and nuanced. 

- The authors propose modeling HHI in images as free text instead of fixed classes. This allows capturing the unlimited variety of possible interactions.

- Learning HHI as free text is challenging due to limited labelled data. The authors use weak supervision from image-caption pairs on the internet.

- They extract pseudo-labels for HHI from noisy internet captions using knowledge distillation and a large language model, without explicit annotation.

- They show these pseudo-labels can train models to effectively predict HHI in images, outperforming prior categorical models.

In summary, the core research question is how to model the long tail of human-human interactions in images as free text, using only weak supervision from readily available image-caption data, rather than small manually annotated datasets. The key novelty is the use of knowledge distillation to create pseudo-labels for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm for learning to understand human-human interactions (HHI) in images as free text, allowing more flexibility than categorical recognition. The key ideas are:

- Modeling HHI as free text instead of fixed categories to capture the vast variety of possible interactions between people. This allows generating descriptions like "dancing" or "shaking hands" instead of forcing a choice from a small set of classes.

- Using knowledge distillation with a large language model on noisy internet image captions to create pseudo-labels describing interactions. This provides training data without expensive manual annotation.

- Introducing the WALDO dataset, a manually annotated benchmark for evaluating HHI understanding models by comparing predicted free text to ground truth descriptions. 

- Showing both qualitatively and quantitatively that models trained on the pseudo-labels can produce more accurate free text for HHI than baseline captioning models. This demonstrates the utility of the proposed pseudo-labelling technique.

In summary, the main contribution is a new paradigm and method for learning to describe the heavy tail of possible human-human interactions in images using weak supervision, instead of being limited to categorical recognition. The pseudo-labelling approach and benchmark dataset enable training models that can generate freer, more accurate textual descriptions of interactions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes learning to understand human-human interactions in images by generating free text descriptions of interactions using knowledge distillation and weak supervision from image captions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new approach for learning to understand human-human interactions (HHI) in images using weak supervision from image captions. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work:

- Focuses on modeling HHI as free text rather than categorical labels. Most prior work has focused on classifying HHI into a small, fixed set of categories. Using free text enables capturing more diverse interactions.

- Leverages weak supervision from captions via knowledge distillation and abstractive summarization. Many existing datasets for HHI understanding come from video data. This work shows how to extract pseudo-labels for HHI from image captions without manual annotation.

- Presents new metrics for evaluating HHI in images. Since HHI is modeled as free text, new metrics are proposed to measure properties like textual similarity, factual consistency, and verb similarity.

- Demonstrates strong quantitative improvements over baseline captioning models by training on the pseudo-labels. The best model achieves substantial gains in metrics like BLEURT and verb similarity on the proposed benchmarks.

- Releases a new manually annotated test set modeling diverse HHI, unlike most categorically labelled datasets. The variety of interactions is meant to reflect the heavy tail.

Overall, this work pioneers a new paradigm for HHI understanding compared to categorical classification approaches. The weak supervision method allows creating pseudo-labels from abundant image-caption data. The results demonstrate that modelling HHI as free text better captures diverse real-world interactions between people.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Incorporating visual grounding into HHI understanding, such as localizing the participants in the image. The current approach predicts the overall interaction but does not ground it in the visual scene.

- Exploring the hierarchical nature of interactions. The paper notes that generic labels like "meeting" may apply to many images, while more specific labels like "shaking hands" describe a subset. Hierarchical prediction could capture interactions at multiple levels of specificity. 

- Disentangling style and content in HHI prediction. Scene cues may provide helpful context but could also be misleading if interactions are hallucinated based on scene style alone. The authors suggest style-content disentanglement could improve robustness.

- Extending the approach to group interactions with more than two participants. The current work focuses on dyadic interactions between two people.

- Evaluating on video input in addition to still images. Video could provide helpful temporal context.

- Incorporating other modalities like speech or pose information alongside images.

- Expanding the variety and diversity of interactions by using additional data sources.

Overall, the main future directions focus on incorporating additional contextual signals into the model, capturing a richer hierarchy and space of interactions, and evaluating the approach on more diverse data including video input. Robustness, generalization, and moving beyond dyadic interactions are also noted as important directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new paradigm for understanding human-human interactions (HHI) in images by predicting them as free text rather than as categorical labels. This allows modeling the diverse space of possible interactions. A key challenge is the lack of supervised data, so the authors use knowledge distillation applied to a large language model to generate pseudo-labels from noisy internet image captions, without needing explicit annotation. Specifically, they extract interactions from captions via parsing, generate more with the language model, and train a summarizer to produce clean interaction texts. Using these as targets for an encoder-decoder model yields better generalization compared to SOTA captioners. They introduce \datasetname, a test set of 1K images with HHI labels, and appropriate textual metrics like BLEURT and verb similarity. Experiments show their method outperforms baseline captioners and situation recognizers for predicting diverse, grounded HHI. The pseudo-labels and test set enable modelling HHI in images as open-ended text.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for understanding human-human interactions in images by generating free text descriptions. Previous works have treated interactions categorically from a small fixed set, but the authors argue this does not capture the diversity of possible interactions. Their key idea is to model interactions as open-ended text, which can express the rich variety of relationships between people. 

To learn these textual interactions, the authors use knowledge distillation applied to a large language model to create pseudo-labels from noisy caption data. They introduce a model training and inference pipeline to generate high-quality pseudo-labels describing interactions visible in images. Experiments demonstrate their method's ability to produce more accurate free text compared to baseline approaches, as measured by similarity to ground truth and other metrics. The authors construct a new test set called Waldo-Wenda with human-curated interactions, which they use along with the imSitu dataset to benchmark performance. Overall, the work presents a novel paradigm and techniques for better understanding human-human interactions through free text generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using knowledge distillation applied to a large language model to generate pseudo-labels representing human-human interactions from noisy image captions. First, they extract some initial human-human interaction texts from captions using syntactic parsing. They also generate additional synthetic interaction texts using a large language model. Then, they use the real and synthetic interactions to prompt the language model to generate synthetic image captions containing those interactions. These synthetic caption-interaction pairs are used to train an abstractive text summarization model to output interaction pseudo-labels from the original noisy captions. The resulting pseudo-labels are used to train image captioning models to predict human-human interactions in images, and outperform existing methods when evaluated on a new curated test set as well as filtered samples from the imSitu dataset. Overall, the key ideas are using knowledge distillation and large language models to infer cleaner interaction labels from noisy caption data, without need for manual annotation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new approach for understanding human-human interactions (HHI) in images, by generating free text descriptions of the interactions rather than categorizing them into a fixed set of classes. 

- It aims to address the challenges of modeling the diverse and heavy-tail space of possible HHIs using standard categorical recognition. Free text generation allows more flexibility.

- The paper presents a method to create "pseudo-labels" for images depicting HHIs by applying knowledge distillation and abstraction from noisy internet image captions, without need for manually labeled interaction data.

- These pseudo-labels are used to train image captioning models to generate free text describing interactions. The models are evaluated on a new manually-curated test set of 1,000 images depicting diverse HHIs.

- Results demonstrate that models trained on the pseudo-labels can effectively generate textual descriptions of interactions in images, outperforming standard captioning models. The paper proposes evaluation metrics to measure groundedness and semantic similarity of generated interactions.

In summary, the key problem is generating flexible free text to describe the heavy tail of possible human-human interactions in images, in absence of labelled interaction data, which the paper aims to address through pseudo-labelling and captioning.
