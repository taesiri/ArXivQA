# [Fine-Grained Self-Endorsement Improves Factuality and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15631)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can still frequently generate incorrect facts or illogical reasoning steps when used for knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks like longform generation, question answering, and mathematical reasoning.
- Prior methods to mitigate this issue like ensemble learning (e.g. self-consistency) or self-refinement (e.g. chain-of-verification) have limitations. Ensemble methods fail on long texts as candidates may differ too much. Self-refinement relies on the LLM's capability for self-critique.

Proposed Solution: 
- A self-endorsement framework that performs fine-grained fact-level comparisons across multiple LLM-sampled responses to identify reliable facts, then produces the final response by selection or regeneration using those facts.
- Does not require complex instructions. Only asks the LLM simple tasks of checking if a fact is consistent with another response, and regenerating a response given additional high-quality facts.
- Can benefit smaller open-source LLMs as mainly conducts content-based comparisons.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the self-endorsement framework that mitigates factual inaccuracies and reasoning errors by leveraging cross-sample fine-grained fact checking and endorsement.
- Demonstrates broad effectiveness across tasks (longform generation, QA, math reasoning) and model sizes by extensive analyses. Outperforms prior state-of-the-art inference-time methods.
- Shows the promise of self-endorsement as a simple plug-and-play inference-time LLM enhancement technique requiring no architectural changes or complex prompting.

In summary, the key innovation is fine-grained fact-level verification across samples to extract reliable knowledge for improving final generations, with minimal dependence on model scale or task type.
