# [A Collision Cone Approach for Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous navigation and collision avoidance are critical for the safe operation of unmanned vehicles like drones and ground robots. Existing methods like artificial potential fields, reachability analysis, and nonlinear MPC have limitations in providing safety guarantees formally or handling dynamic obstacles effectively. This paper aims to develop a unified control framework for autonomous ground and aerial vehicles to avoid collisions with moving obstacles.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel formulation of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) based on the concept of collision cones. Collision cones represent the set of relative velocity vectors between the vehicle and obstacle that can lead to collision. The proposed Collision Cone CBF (C3BF) constrains the relative velocity to always point away from each other. This avoids the collision cone geometrically. C3BFs are encoded as constraints in a Quadratic Program (CBF-QP) that outputs optimal control inputs for real-time collision avoidance.

The C3BF concept is applied to unicycle, bicycle and quadrotor models of ground and aerial vehicles. Formal proofs are provided to show these formulations constitute valid CBFs for avoiding moving obstacles. Comparisons also highlight C3BFs are less conservative and more intuitive than higher-order CBF alternatives.


Main Contributions:

- Novel CBF formulation based on collision cones to constrain relative velocity and ensure collision avoidance geometrically

- Unified control framework using CBF-QP for autonomous ground vehicles (unicycle, bicycle models) and aerial vehicles (quadrotors)

- Formal guarantees for avoiding moving obstacles with C3BF applied to different vehicle models  

- Simulation and hardware experiments on Turtlebot, Stoch-jeep car and Crazyflie drones validating real-time collision avoidance

- Analysis showing less conservative guarantees compared to state-of-the-art higher order CBF methods

In summary, the paper proposes Collision Cone CBFs as an intuitive approach with formal safety guarantees for autonomous vehicles to avoid moving obstacles in real-time. Effectiveness is shown through simulation and hardware results on various ground and aerial robot platforms.
