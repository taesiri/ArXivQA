# [Tune without Validation: Searching for Learning Rate and Weight Decay on   Training Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Hyperparameter (HP) tuning is crucial for training high-performing deep neural networks. The traditional approach relies on using a separate validation set to search for optimal HPs like learning rate and weight decay. However, collecting additional validation data is expensive and challenging, especially for small datasets or sensitive domains like healthcare. Therefore, there is a need for HP tuning methods that can work directly on the training set.

Proposed Solution - Twin:
The paper proposes Twin, a method to tune learning rate and weight decay directly on the training set without needing a validation set. Twin is based on recent theory that deep network training goes through different phases like comprehension, memorization etc. It performs a grid search using early stopping and monitors training loss and weight norms. The area with lowest weight norm within the well-fitting region predicts better generalization. 

Key Contributions:
- Twin simplifies the traditional HP tuning pipeline by eliminating the validation set for tuning learning rate and weight decay
- Extensive experiments over 20 datasets and multiple architectures like CNNs, MLPs, transformers demonstrate Twin's effectiveness 
- On average, Twin matches ideal but unrealistic Oracle that tunes on test set directly
- Twin works well for both training from scratch and transfer learning
- It is robust against different grid densities, optimizers, model scales and domains like natural images, medical images etc.

In summary, the paper presents Twin that can reliably tune two most important HPs, learning rate and weight decay, directly on training sets. This helps avoid the traditional validation set and the associated complications.
