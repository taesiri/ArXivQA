# [BAD-Gaussians: Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing accurate 3D scenes from images is challenging, especially when the input images contain motion blur. Methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) rely on sharp, well-posed images and struggle with blurry inputs. Existing learning-based approaches that handle motion blur have limitations:

- Implicit scene representations in NeRF struggle to reconstruct intricate details and do not allow real-time rendering
- Fixing inaccurate poses during training degrades reconstruction quality 
- Recovering accurate poses from blurry images is difficult

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes BAD-Gaussians, the first motion deblur method based on explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting. It models the physical image formation process of motion blur and optimizes Gaussian scene representation jointly with camera motion trajectories within exposure time. 

Key ideas:
- Model exposure time camera trajectory with spline interpolation between start and end poses
- Render sequence of sharp frames along trajectory, average to synthesize blurry image  
- Optimize Gaussians and poses by minimizing difference between rendered and real blurry images
- Leverage explicit Gaussian scene representation for efficiency and quality

Contributions:
- First real-time capable neural rendering deblurring method
- Outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of quality and speed
- Jointly optimizes poses and Gaussians using differentiable rendering
- Handles complex camera motions and real captured data
- Achieves higher quality than NeRF-based approaches by using explicit scene representation

The key novelty is extending neural rendering deblurring to the efficient Gaussian Splatting framework and jointly optimizing scene and poses in a physically based manner. This leads to higher quality and the first real-time capable deblurring neural rendering method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called BAD-Gaussians that handles severe motion-blurred images with inaccurate camera poses to achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by jointly optimizing explicit Gaussian scene representations and camera motion trajectories within a differentiable rendering framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a photometric bundle adjustment formulation specifically designed for motion-blurred images, achieving the first real-time rendering performance from motion-blurred images within the framework of 3D Gaussian Splatting.

2. Demonstrating how this formulation enables the acquisition of high-quality 3D scene representation from a set of motion-blurred images. 

3. The proposed approach successfully deblurs severe motion-blurred images, synthesizes higher-quality novel view images, and achieves real-time rendering, surpassing previous state-of-the-art implicit deblurring rendering methods.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a new method called BAD-Gaussians that can jointly optimize the 3D scene representation as Gaussian spheres and the camera motion trajectories from motion-blurred images. This allows high quality 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of scenes from blurred images, outperforming prior work.
