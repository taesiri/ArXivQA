# [OffLanDat: A Community Based Implicit Offensive Language Dataset   Generated by Large Language Model Through Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive language on social media is increasing and causing harm, but implicit offensive language lacking direct slurs is hard to detect. 
- Existing datasets rely on offensive keywords so miss implicit cases.  
- Most methods ignore community/target group context that gives useful signals.
- Generating offensive data for research is unethical, expensive and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new OffLanDat dataset with 8270 examples over 38 target groups in 7 categories, including novel groups related to diet, body structure and jobs.
- Show a prompt engineering method to elicit offensive texts from ChatGPT despite its content restrictions.
- Annotate dataset with both crowdworkers and ChatGPT to compare. 
- Evaluate state-of-the-art models on detecting community-based implicit offenses.

Key Contributions:
- Community-focused dataset filling gaps on implicit, context-specific offenses against unstudied groups 
- First prompting technique to overcome ethical barriers and leverage ChatGPT for offensive data generation
- Analysis of ChatGPT's offensive text detection capabilities via comparison to human annotations
- Benchmark of latest NLP models on challenging implicit offense detection task

The paper makes useful progress on the important problem of implicit offensive language detection through novel data, prompt engineering innovations and benchmarking state-of-the-art systems.
