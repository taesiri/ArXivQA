# [NeRF-AD: Neural Radiance Field with Attention-based Disentanglement for   Talking Face Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12568)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Talking face synthesis from audio is important for applications like virtual reality but is challenging to make realistic. 
- Existing 2D methods lack 3D realism. 3D methods are complex and require lots of data. 
- Recent NeRF-based methods burden NeRF with complex tasks or map audio imprecisely to facial regions. This results in inaccurate lip shapes.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose NeRF-AD, a talking face synthesis method via NeRF with attention-based disentanglement.
- Key ideas:
   - Disentangle talking face into Audio-face (speech-related regions) and Identity-face using a novel Attention module guided by facial action units (AUs).
   - Only fuse Audio-face and audio features under AU supervision for precise control.  
   - Provide Identity-face and fused Audio-face features as separate conditions to NeRF instead of complete talking face. This decomposes the task for NeRF.

Main Contributions:
- Attention module to disentangle important Audio-face based on AUs, allowing precise audio-face fusion.
- Use of AU information to supervise multimodal fusion for accuracy.  
- Decomposing talking face into precise conditions for NeRF - reduces its learning burden significantly.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating realistic talking faces with better lip synchronization accuracy.

In summary, the key innovation is the attention-based facial disentanglement to provide precise decomposed conditions to NeRF for high-quality talking face synthesis. This reduces NeRF's complexity while improving accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a talking face synthesis method via neural radiance fields with attention-based disentanglement (NeRF-AD) that disentangles the input talking face into audio-face and identity-face components to reduce the learning burden on NeRF and improve lip synchronization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. To reduce the learning burden of NeRF and improve the accuracy of face rendering, the method decomposes the talking face and provides two decomposed precise conditions (the Audio-face feature and Identity-face feature) for the NeRF.

2. An Attention-based Disentanglement module is proposed, which allows audio to be precisely fused with the facial region related to speech movements. Meanwhile, various methods are employed to supervise the entire process. 

3. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed NeRF-AD method outperforms the state-of-the-art in generating realistic and accurate talking faces.

In summary, the key contribution is using attention and disentanglement to provide precise conditional inputs to NeRF for talking face synthesis, while ensuring accuracy through supervision. This reduces NeRF's learning burden and improves results over previous state-of-the-art methods.

The paper proposes a talking face synthesis method using NeRF with attention-based disentanglement (NeRF-AD). It disentangles the input talking face into an Audio-face and Identity-face using an Attention-based Disentanglement module guided by facial action units. The Audio-face is fused with the audio feature while the Identity-face represents identity. A conditional NeRF then renders the talking face images using these decomposed precise conditions. The method is evaluated on metrics like image quality, facial action unit accuracy, landmark distance, and lip sync confidence for quantitative analysis.
