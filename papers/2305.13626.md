# [Prompting and Evaluating Large Language Models for Proactive Dialogues:   Clarification, Target-guided, and Non-collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13626)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How capable are Large Language Models (LLMs) at handling proactive dialogues, and how can prompting schemes be designed to enhance the proactivity of LLM-based conversational systems?

Specifically, the paper comprehensively evaluates and analyzes the performance of LLM-based dialogue systems on three key aspects of proactive dialogues:

1) Asking clarification questions when encountering ambiguous user queries.

2) Proactively guiding the conversation towards a designated target topic or entity. 

3) Strategically handling dialogues with competing or conflicting goals between the system and user.

To address potential limitations of LLMs for proactive dialogues, the authors propose a prompting scheme called Proactive Chain-of-Thought (ProCoT) prompting. This is designed to trigger the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs to allow them to take initiative and work towards conversational goals. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that LLMs have inherent strengths and weaknesses when it comes to proactive dialogues, and that appropriate prompting schemes can significantly enhance their capabilities in this area. The comprehensive empirical analysis aims to test this hypothesis and shed light on how best to design LLM-based proactive dialogue systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key contributions are:

1. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation on the proactivity of LLM-based dialogue systems, including handling clarification, target-guided, and non-collaborative dialogues. This provides a broad assessment on whether recent LLM-based conversational systems like ChatGPT are equipped to manage different aspects of proactive dialogues.

2. The paper proposes a novel prompting scheme called proactive chain-of-thought (ProCoT) prompting to enhance the proactivity of LLM-based dialogue systems. ProCoT augments LLMs with the capability of planning and taking initiative towards conversational goals by generating descriptive reasoning chains. 

3. Through extensive experiments on clarification, target-guided, and non-collaborative dialogue tasks, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the capabilities and limitations of LLM-based systems for proactive dialogues under different prompting schemes. Key findings include:

- LLMs fail to ask clarification questions without explicit instructions. ProCoT overcomes this limitation but performance still lags on domain-specific tasks.

- LLMs aggressively shift topics towards targets. ProCoT enables smoother topic transitions. 

- LLMs struggle with strategy learning for non-collaborative dialogues even with ProCoT.

Overall, the comprehensive evaluation and analysis in this paper shed light on the potentials as well as current limitations of LLM-based conversational systems for proactive dialogues, while the proposed ProCoT prompting provides a means to enhance their proactivity. The findings help guide future research towards building more capable LLM-based proactive dialogue systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language model (LLM) based dialogue systems on their capabilities for handling three aspects of proactive dialogues - clarification, target-guided conversation, and non-collaborative negotiation; it proposes a prompting scheme called Proactive Chain-of-Thought (ProCoT) to enhance the proactivity of LLM-based systems and shows through empirical findings that ProCoT improves performance on clarification and target-guided conversation but LLMs still struggle with non-collaborative negotiation which requires more strategic planning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is an analysis comparing this paper to other related work in the same field:

Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution to the field of proactive dialogue systems and large language model research. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of large language models on different aspects of proactive dialogues, which has not been thoroughly studied before. 

In terms of clarification dialogues, most prior work has focused on developing specialized models for clarification generation, such as CLARiFy (Guo et al. 2021) and UniPCQA (Liao et al. 2021). This paper shows that large language models can perform competitively on clarification when prompted appropriately, though fine-tuned models still have an edge for domain-specific applications.

For target-guided dialogues, this paper demonstrates large language models have a very strong capability for topic shifting when standard prompting is used. However, they tend to make abrupt topic transitions. By comparison, prior work like DKRN (Moon et al. 2020) and CKC (Huang et al. 2021) use retrieval mechanisms or knowledge graphs to enable smoother topic transitions. This paper shows prompting large language models with chain of thought can achieve smooth and natural topic shifting as well.

Regarding non-collaborative dialogues, most existing work has developed specialized models for strategic dialogue, such as negotiation (He et al. 2018) and persuasion (Wang et al. 2019). This paper reveals large language models struggle with strategic planning for non-collaboration even when prompted. The analysis indicates large language models tend to make compromises rather than argue for their own interests. More research is needed to impart negotiation and persuasion abilities to large language models.

In summary, this paper provides useful insights into strengths and limitations of large language models for proactive dialogues. The prompting methods help large language models handle clarification and topic shifting competitively with specialized models in many cases. However, strategic non-collaborative dialogue remains a challenge. The analysis will inform future work on improving large language model capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing improved methods for proactively prompting and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for dialogue. The authors suggest exploring more sophisticated prompting schemes that can provide LLMs with better capabilities for reasoning, planning, and strategy learning in dialogue systems.

- Exploring approaches to close the gap between LLMs and fine-tuned models for domain-specific clarification and proactive dialogues. The results showed LLMs still fell short on the finance domain clarification task, indicating a need for improved methods to provide LLMs with domain knowledge.

- Enhancing the capability of LLMs for strategy optimization and planning in non-collaborative dialogues like negotiation. The authors found this was a key limitation of LLMs on the negotiation task, suggesting more work is needed to improve strategic planning abilities. 

- Evaluating the generalization ability of prompted LLMs on unseen datasets/tasks related to proactive dialogues. The current study focused on a set of existing datasets, so testing generalization is an important next step.

- Investigating methods to make LLMs exhibit more human-like conversational behaviors like smoother topic transitions. The results showed LLMs tended to make abrupt topic changes, suggesting work on generating more natural topic shifts.

- Developing human-in-the-loop techniques like demonstrations or interventions during conversations to improve LLM proactivity. The prompting schemes relied on upfront instructions, so exploring interactive human guidance is a promising direction.

- Studying combinations of prompting and fine-tuning to better adapt LLMs for proactive dialogue abilities. Prompting provided a good starting point but fine-tuning on task data could further improve performance.

In summary, the authors suggest continuing to advance prompting techniques and reducing the gap with fine-tuned models, enhancing LLMs' strategic planning capabilities, testing generalization, and exploring human-in-the-loop guidance as promising future directions for LLM-based proactive dialogue systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes prompting and evaluating large language models for proactive dialogues involving clarification, target-guided, and non-collaborative conversations. Despite impressive capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT in context understanding and response generation, they still have limitations in proactive dialogue abilities like providing random guesses or failing to refuse problematic requests.

They design a Proactive Chain-of-Thought (ProCoT) prompting scheme to enhance LLMs' proactivity by augmenting goal planning over descriptive reasoning chains. Experiments are conducted with ChatGPT and Vicuna on datasets for the three dialogue types. Key findings are: 1) LLMs rarely ask clarification without prompting; ProCoT largely improves this but performance still lags on domain-specific tasks. 2) LLMs aggressively shift topics towards targets; ProCoT enables smoother transitions. 3) LLMs fail at strategic decisions for non-collaborative dialogues even with ProCoT. Overall, the work provides the first comprehensive analysis of LLM capabilities on proactive dialogues, proposes the ProCoT prompting scheme to enhance proactivity, and offers insights to guide future research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of large language model (LLM) based conversational systems, focusing on their capabilities for proactive dialogues. Proactive dialogues refer to the system taking initiative in the conversation, rather than just passively responding to user inputs. The analysis looks at three key aspects of proactive dialogues: clarification, target-guided, and non-collaborative dialogues. 

To enhance the proactivity of LLMs, the authors propose a prompting scheme called Proactive Chain-of-Thought (ProCoT). This prompting guides the LLM through intermediate reasoning steps to plan towards achieving the conversational goal. Experiments are conducted with ChatGPT and Vicuna across the three dialogue aspects. Key findings show that ProCoT prompting significantly improves performance on clarification and target-guided dialogues. However LLMs still struggle with non-collaborative dialogues, indicating limitations in strategic planning capabilities. Overall, the analysis provides useful insights and discussion on developing proactive LLM-based dialogue systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.
