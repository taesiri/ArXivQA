# [Any-Precision LLM: Low-Cost Deployment of Multiple, Different-Sized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10517)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have extreme memory and computational requirements, hampering their deployment on edge devices. Quantization can help but prior works lack support for dynamic precision and inherit per-bit model retraining.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "incremental upscaling", which starts from a low-precision seed model and upscales to higher bit-widths without any additional training. Models can be upscaled to any arbitrary bit-width.

- Propose specialized kernel to efficiently run models at dynamic precisions during inference.

Key Contributions:  
- Show that incremental upscaling matches stand-alone quantization quality (perplexity, accuracy) across 5 models, 3 datasets, and all bit-widths.

- Demonstrate 2-6x end-to-end speedups over FP16 across mobile and edge GPUs. Latency scales linearly with lower bit-width.

- The proposed kernel outperforms prior academic and commercial quantization kernels.

- Enable trading off latency and quality at runtime by adjusting bit-width instead of using multiple models. Any bit-width from 3-8 bits is supported without retraining.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient and high-quality quantization technique to deploy large language models on edge devices with dynamic precision support. The specialized kernel combined with incremental upscaling provides flexibility and efficiency.
