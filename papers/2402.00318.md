# [Analog-digital Scheduling for Federated Learning: A   Communication-Efficient Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach where devices collaboratively train a shared model while keeping data decentralized. 
- Realizing FL over wireless networks faces challenges due to fading, interference, and limited spectrum resources. Using orthogonal resource blocks (RBs) to transmit local gradients digitally mitigates noise but increases latency. Analog over-the-air (OTA) aggregation reduces latency by allowing simultaneous transmissions, but is impacted by the device with the worst channel.
- There is a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and latency in wireless FL systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ADFL, an analog-digital FL scheme. In each round, the parameter server (PS) schedules each device to either:
   1) Upload its gradient via OTA aggregation (analog scheme)
   2) Transmit a quantized version of its gradient over an orthogonal RB (digital scheme)
- The PS decides the transmission scheme for each device by solving an optimization problem to minimize mean squared error (MSE) on the estimated global gradient subject to a round delay constraint. This yields the optimal configuration of devices scheduled for digital vs. analog transmission.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates an MSE-delay trade-off optimization problem for joint device scheduling and quantization bit allocation in ADFL
- Provides a structural property that converts the combinatorial device scheduling into a linear search problem
- Derives closed-form solution for (relaxed) bit allocation using Lagrangian duality
- Demonstrates via simulations that ADFL outperforms OTA-only and digital-only schemes in both IID and non-IID settings
- Shows ADFL strikes a better balance between accuracy and latency compared to prior analog or digital FL designs

In summary, the key idea is to leverage both analog and digital transmissions in a wireless FL system in order to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The paper provides an optimization framework, analysis, and evaluations around this concept.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning scheme called ADFL that schedules devices to transmit gradients either via analog over-the-air aggregation or over orthogonal digital channels in order to balance the trade-off between noise and latency in gradient aggregation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ADFL, a novel analog-digital federated learning scheme. Specifically:

- ADFL allows scheduling each device in each round to either transmit its gradient via analog over-the-air aggregation or send the quantized gradient over an orthogonal digital channel. 

- The key innovation is formulating and solving an optimization problem to minimize the mean squared error on the estimated global gradient at the parameter server, subject to a constraint on the round delay, by jointly optimizing the device transmission mode selection and number of quantization bits.

- Through analysis and simulations, the paper shows that by suitably leveraging both analog and digital transmission modes, ADFL consistently outperforms existing analog-only and digital-only federated learning schemes in terms of test accuracy, across both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data distribution settings.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and analyzing an analog-digital scheme for communication-efficient federated learning that provably achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Federated learning (FL)
- Over-the-air (OTA) computation/aggregation
- Analog-digital federated learning (ADFL)
- Device scheduling
- Mean squared error (MSE) 
- Delay-aware federated learning
- Gradient quantization
- Combinatorial optimization
- Convex optimization
- Duality theory

The paper proposes a federated learning framework called ADFL that combines both OTA computation/aggregation and digital transmissions over orthogonal channels. It aims to balance the tradeoff between noise (MSE) and latency by optimally scheduling devices to either use the OTA or digital scheme in each round. Some key problems addressed include device scheduling to minimize MSE under a delay constraint and bit allocation for gradient quantization. Both combinatorial and convex optimization techniques are leveraged to solve these problems efficiently. The performance gains of ADFL over other schemes are demonstrated through simulations.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose an "analog-digital" federated learning (ADFL) scheme that combines analog over-the-air computation with digital transmissions over orthogonal resource blocks.
