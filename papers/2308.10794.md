# [MGMAE: Motion Guided Masking for Video Masked Autoencoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10794)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the performance of video masked autoencoding by incorporating motion information into the masking strategy?The key hypothesis is that using motion information to guide the masking process will help create more challenging and meaningful pretraining tasks, leading to better learned video representations. Specifically, the authors propose using optical flow to track masking maps across frames and generate temporally consistent masking volumes. This allows sampling a consistent set of visible tokens over time rather than masking randomly or using a "tube masking" approach. By constructing consistent masking cubes that track objects over time, the authors hypothesize this motion guided masking approach (MGMAE) will:- Further reduce the risk of information leakage between frames, since objects cannot be unmasked in some frames and masked in others.- Encourage learning more useful spatiotemporal structure information by enforcing reconstruction from limited consistent tracks of visible cubes. - Adapt better to motion variations compared to tube masking approaches that assume small/no motion between frames.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicit motion guided masking will create a more challenging pretraining task and result in improved video representations compared to prior work like VideoMAE. The experiments aim to validate if MGMAE does improve action recognition accuracy after pretraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a motion guided masking strategy for video masked autoencoder pre-training, called MGMAE. The key contributions are:- It introduces a motion guided masking approach to generate temporally consistent masking volumes for video clips. Specifically, it uses optical flow estimated by RAFT to warp the initial random mask to adjacent frames. This motion guided masking can better suppress information leakage in time during pre-training. - Based on the temporally consistent masking volumes, it samples a set of cubes to keep visible across the entire clip. This allows building a more challenging reconstruction task by enforcing temporal consistency on the visible cubes. - It implements the motion guided masking strategy on top of the VideoMAE framework. Experiments on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics datasets demonstrate MGMAE consistently outperforms VideoMAE with tube masking.- It provides detailed ablation studies on the design choices of motion guided masking, such as base frame selection, warping methods, initialization, etc. This verifies the effectiveness of each component in the proposed masking strategy.- It also visualizes the generated motion guided masking volumes and reconstructed videos to showcase that MGMAE can effectively track objects and sample coherent cubes for pre-training.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the motion guided masking approach for video MAE to build a more challenging pre-training task by incorporating temporal consistency. This simple yet effective strategy further pushes the limit of video masked autoencoder.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in video masked autoencoding:- This paper introduces a motion guided masking strategy for video masked autoencoders. Previous works like VideoMAE and MAE-ST used random or tube masking, which do not take motion into account. Using optical flow to guide masking is a novel idea for video masked modeling.- The motion guided masking helps build a more challenging pre-training task by suppressing information leakage across frames. The increased difficulty encourages learning more effective spatiotemporal representations. The higher pre-train loss reflects this harder task. - Experiments show the motion guided masking benefits video pre-training, especially on motion-centric datasets like Something-Something. This demonstrates the importance of incorporating motion priors for video masked autoencoders.- The proposed method is simple and efficient. It uses an online lightweight optical flow estimator and backward warping to align masking maps. This makes it easy to integrate into existing video MAE frameworks.- Compared to other video MAE works, this paper provides more in-depth analysis like per-class accuracy breakdown and visualization of the masking process. This gives better intuition about the model behaviors.- The performance gain over VideoMAE is smaller on Kinetics-400. This suggests scene-centric datasets may rely less on motion information for pre-training. Different datasets may need customized designs.- Overall, this work makes an important step towards designing effective and inductive bias video masked autoencoders. The motion guided masking offers a general solution while remaining simple and efficient.In summary, the key contribution is using motion as an inductive bias in video MAE pre-training. This simple but effective idea helps construct a more challenging task and learn better video representations. The thorough experiments and analysis also provide useful insights to guide future research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring more advanced optical flow estimation methods to generate the motion guided masking maps. The authors use a simple online RAFT model in this work, but more accurate optical flow could potentially further improve the masking and lead to better pre-trained models.- Investigating adaptive masking strategies that can dynamically adjust the masking ratio and region based on motion and content complexity. The current approach uses a fixed high masking ratio for all videos.- Applying the motion guided masking strategy to other self-supervised pretext tasks beyond autoencoding, such as contrastive learning frameworks. - Scaling up the model and dataset size for masked video pre-training, to further explore the potential of large-scale video foundation models.- Extending the motion guided masking approach to other video model architectures beyond Transformer, such as convolutional networks.- Evaluating the transfer learning performance of MGMAE pre-trained models on various downstream tasks beyond action recognition, like video object detection, segmentation, etc.- Exploring whether incorporating other motion representations beyond optical flow, such as scene flow or trajectory, could provide further benefits.In summary, the key suggestions are leveraging more advanced motion estimation, adaptive masking, scaling up in terms of model and data size, transferring to other tasks, and using other motion cues to further improve video masked pre-training.
