# [Protected group bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14727)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT have shown impressive capabilities across many NLP tasks, but may perpetuate harmful societal biases against protected groups related to gender, sexuality, religion, and race/ethnicity. 

- This paper investigates whether the latest LLMs show improvements in reducing or eliminating such biases, which could have negative impacts if deployed in real-world applications without safeguards.

Methodology:
- The authors test an LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) using two tasks:
   1. Suggesting occupations for individuals from different protected groups based on templates 
   2. Generating free-form stories about people in different occupations
   
- For the first task, they create 1998 prompts covering different combinations of groups and collect 11,964 completions from the LLM.

- Human annotators labeled each response for level of bias and categorized the type of bias.

- For the second task, they generate 2610 stories based on stereotypically male, female and gender-neutral occupations.

- They programmatically label the gender of protagonists in the stories using pronoun usage.

Key Findings:
- The LLM exhibits significant biases related to gender, sexuality, religion and race in the occupational associations task.

- Only white, straight, non-religious, cisgender men avoid biased responses. All other groups receive biased suggestions.

- The LLM appears to "over-correct" by emphasizing diversity/equity so strongly for marginalized groups that it overrides individual differences.

- The free-form stories display biases amplifying gender stereotypes in occupations as well as heteronormativity and Western-centric names.

- Biases increase for individuals belonging to multiple marginalized groups (intersectionality).

Implications:
- Despite recent advances, LLMs still perpetuate and amplify societal biases against protected groups in concerning ways.

- The over-correction bias highlights risks of artificial constraints meant to avoid harm - they may cause harm themselves if applied without nuance.

- More work is needed to address bias in LLMs before widespread real-world deployment, especially for critical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates gender, sexual orientation, religion, and race/ethnicity bias in a large language model by soliciting sentence completions about occupations of individuals from different protected groups and generating stories about people in various occupations, finding the model reflects and amplifies societal biases, especially regarding gender and sexuality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper conducts a systematic study investigating the presence of biases and stereotypes towards protected groups (gender, sexuality, religion, race/ethnicity) in a large language model (LLM). Specifically, it examines whether recent advances that aim to reduce harmful model outputs have also reduced biased outputs in these areas. 

The authors collect over 10,000 sentence completions from a publicly available LLM using biased prompt templates they develop. They also generate stories associating occupations with different genders using the LLM. The outputs are manually annotated for presence of bias.

The key findings are:

- Biases and stereotypes persist across all protected groups, but especially for gender and sexuality. The model appears to amplify rather than simply reflect societal biases. 

- The model is overly cautious about potential offense, emphasizing diversity/equity so strongly that group identities are overshadowed. This itself introduces a form of bias.

- Intersectional biases increase exponentially with more identity dimensions.

- Additional biases found include heteronormativity, Western-centrism, and gender-occupation stereotypes.

So in summary, the paper provides evidence that despite advances, state-of-the-art LLMs still exhibit significant biases, especially for minoritized groups. It also highlights limitations of current debiasing approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Bias 
- Stereotypes
- Protected groups/categories (gender, sexuality, religion, race/ethnicity)  
- Intersectional biases
- Sentence completion tasks
- Annotations (answer types, bias types)
- Occupation associations
- Harmful outputs
- Diversity emphasis
- Overcorrection
- Gender bias (in free text generation)
- Heteronormativity
- Western bias (in names chosen)

The paper investigates bias and stereotyping in large language models, specifically in the domains of gender, sexuality, religion and race/ethnicity. It looks at bias in both constrained sentence completions as well as free text generation. The main findings are that the LLM reflects societal biases and tends to overemphasize diversity in a way that leads to further issues. There is also evidence of gender bias and heteronormativity in the free form text.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in the paper:

1. The paper studies bias in AI systems along four categories: gender, sexuality, religion, and race/ethnicity. Do you think additional categories like disability, age, or socioeconomic status should have been included as well? Why or why not?

2. The authors acknowledge a Western/US bias in the selection of categories and values tested, especially for religion and race. How might results differ if a more globally representative set of categories and values were tested instead?

3. For the occupation continuations task, do you think the model's tendency to provide "non-committal" generic responses indicates progress in mitigating harmful bias, or does it raise new concerns about over-correction and lack of content? Explain.

4. The authors note that constraining outputs can itself cause harm. How might the constraints placed on this model's outputs negatively impact certain groups or use cases, even if intended positively? Provide examples.

5. For analyzing intersectional biases, combining all categories exponentially grows the number of test cases. What selective strategies could help keep the number of test cases tractable while still providing insight into intersectional biases?

6. The model showed significant correlation between perceived and actual gender representation across occupations. Does this indicate the model amplifies real-world biases, or simply reflects them? What additional analyses could help distinguish amplification from reflection?

7. What are the limitations of using third-party judgment of bias rather than analysis of model parameters or internal representations directly? How might the methodology be augmented to provide more direct insight into the model?

8. How suitable do you think the occupations and templates used in this study are for analyzing occupational bias across such a diverse set of gender, sexual, religious, and racial/ethnic groups? What changes would you suggest?

9. The authors disagree on what the ideal model behavior should be for the biased prompts posed. What ethical considerations come into play here, and how might consensus be reached?

10. The paper analyzes just one model. How could the methodology be expanded to compare bias mitigation progress across multiple models and model versions over time?
