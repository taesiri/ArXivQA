# [Constrained Online Two-stage Stochastic Optimization: Algorithm with   (and without) Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies an online two-stage stochastic optimization problem with long-term constraints over a finite horizon of T periods. In each period t, the decision maker first chooses the first-stage decision c_t, then observes a random parameter realization theta_t, and finally chooses the second-stage decision x_t from a feasible set depending on c_t and theta_t. The goal is to minimize the total objective over T periods while satisfying long-term average constraints on the second-stage decisions. The distributions P_t of theta_t are unknown and can be non-stationary. 

The paper considers two settings:
(1) With predictions: historical data provides predictions hat{P}_t of P_t. 
(2) Without predictions: P_t are stationary but realizations theta_t can be adversarially corrupted.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper develops a general algorithmic framework based on adversarial learning to update dual variables for the constraints. For the predictions setting, the Informational Adversarial Learning (IAL) algorithm uses the predictions to guide solving inner two-stage stochastic optimization problems and updating dual variables. For the no predictions setting, the Doubly Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm uses simultaneous adversarial learning on both first-stage decisions and dual variables.

Main Contributions:
- New regret bounds that match lower bounds in both settings and incorporate inaccuracies of predictions/corruptions
- IAL algorithm for non-stationary setting with predictions, achieves O(sqrt(T)) + O(W_T) regret where W_T measures total prediction inaccuracy
- DAL algorithm for stationary setting with corruptions, achieves O(sqrt(T)) + O(W_T) regret where W_T is number of corruptions  
- General algorithmic framework for online two-stage stochastic optimization that combines optimization with adversarial learning
- Asymptotically feasible solutions to constraints as regrets are sublinear
- Numerical experiments validate the algorithms

In summary, the paper provides a new algorithmic approach and analysis for online two-stage stochastic optimization problems with long-term constraints, obtains tight regret bounds, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops online algorithms with sublinear regret bounds for a two-stage stochastic optimization problem over a finite horizon, with long-term constraints on the cumulative second-stage decisions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to Section 1.1, the main contribution of this paper is an algorithmic framework that develops new algorithms for online two-stage stochastic optimization with long-term constraints by utilizing adversarial learning algorithms. Specifically, the paper:

1) Develops the Informative Adversarial Learning (IAL) algorithm that achieves a regret bound of O(W+sqrt(T)) for the non-stationary setting when distributional predictions are available, matching the derived lower bound that depends on the prediction inaccuracy W. 

2) Develops the Doubly Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm that achieves a regret bound of O(W+sqrt(T)) for the stationary setting with adversarial corruptions, matching the derived corruption-dependent lower bound.

3) Shows how the framework can incorporate different adversarial learning algorithms like Hedge and OGD to update the dual variables and first-stage decisions.

4) Extends the algorithms and results to settings with non-convex objectives and constraints, and to problems with covering constraints.

In summary, the main contribution is a general algorithmic framework to obtain optimal dynamic policies for two-stage stochastic optimization with long-term constraints by using adversarial learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Online two-stage stochastic optimization: The paper studies a model where in each time period, a first-stage decision is made, then a random parameter is observed, and finally a second-stage decision is made. The goal is to minimize a cumulative objective over a finite time horizon.

- Long-term constraints: In addition to constraints coupling the first-stage and second-stage decisions each period, there are also long-term constraints on the average second-stage decisions over the entire time horizon. 

- Regret: The performance metric is regret, defined as the difference between the objective value achieved by an online policy and that achieved by an optimal dynamic policy which knows the distributions.

- Non-stationarity: The paper considers settings where the distributions generating the random parameters in each time period are non-stationary, i.e. can change over time.

- Machine learning predictions: To enable sublinear regret bounds, the paper leverages machine-learned distributional predictions of the random parameters in each time period. The accuracy of these predictions influences the regret.

- Adversarial corruptions: In one setting without distributional predictions, the paper allows adversarial corruptions of the sampled random parameters while requiring the distributions are static.

- Adversarial online learning: The algorithms developed leverage expert algorithms and online convex optimization to update dual variables and decisions in an online manner.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Informative Adversarial Learning (IAL) algorithm that incorporates predictions into the adversarial learning of the dual variables. Can you explain in more detail how the predictions are used to construct the per-period objective functions $\hLInner_t$ that guide the dual variable updates? 

2. The regret analysis of the IAL algorithm relies on decomposing the overall dual objective into a sum of per-period objectives. What is the intuition behind why this decomposition holds and how does it facilitate the regret analysis?

3. The regret bound for IAL involves a term $W_T$ that captures the total inaccuracy of the predictions. Can you explain why the regret must depend on this term and how the IAL algorithm's regret matches the lower bound derived?  

4. For the setting without predictions, the paper proposes a Doubly Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm. Can you explain the need for two levels of adversarial learning in DAL and contrast the updates of the two algorithms OGD and Hedge?

5. How does the corruption model in the setting without predictions differ from the inaccuracy captured by $W_T$ in the setting with predictions? Why can a sublinear regret still be obtained under the corruption model?

6. The paper considers both packing constraints and covering constraints. What is the main difference in the algorithm design and analysis between these two types of constraints?

7. Both IAL and DAL algorithms use the Lagrangian dual formulation extensively. What motivates taking the dual perspective and how does it connect to adversarial learning?

8. Can the algorithms and analysis be extended to the case where the first-stage and second-stage objective functions are non-convex? What additional assumptions would be needed?

9. The regret bounds have an additive dependence on $T$. Can you obtain regret bounds that scale as $o(T)$ by making stronger assumptions on the amount of non-stationarity? 

10. How do the models and algorithmic techniques compare to related work on bandits with knapsacks, online allocation problems, and online packing problems? What extensions would be needed to apply the techniques more broadly?
