# [New Evaluation Metrics Capture Quality Degradation due to LLM   Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- With the rise of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, there is a need to trace and ensure integrity of machine-generated text. This has led to LLM watermarking techniques that embed markers into the text.  
- However, research on LLM watermarking often relies on perplexity or diversity measures to evaluate quality, which can mask limitations. There is a need for better evaluation approaches.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper introduces two new methods to evaluate LLM watermarking:
   1. Evaluation by an LLM-judger (GPT-3.5 Turbo) that ranks watermarked and unwatermarked text on coherence, relevance etc.
   2. Binary classifier on text embeddings to distinguish watermarked vs unwatermarked text.

- These methods are applied to assess current watermarking techniques like soft-watermarking and a robust distortion-free watermark.

Key Findings:
- Classifiers and judgers show preference for unwatermarked text, indicating issues in current watermarking methods.
- Watermarking impacts text quality, especially coherence and depth. 
- There is a trade-off between watermark robustness and text quality.
- Even distortion-free watermarking algorithms degrade quality perceptibly.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of two new analysis methods for evaluating LLM watermarks.
- Demonstration that current watermarking approaches are detectable and degrade text quality.
- Underscores need for more informative metrics to assess watermarking quality.
- Findings motivate development of more subtle and less intrusive techniques.

In summary, the paper makes a case for new benchmarking approaches for LLM watermarking and shows limitations in present methods, motivating further research into perceptually invisible techniques.
