# [HumanRF: High-Fidelity Neural Radiance Fields for Humans in Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we reconstruct high-fidelity neural radiance fields that capture detailed appearance and motion of full-body humans in long video sequences, enabling photorealistic novel view synthesis from unseen viewpoints?The key points are:- The goal is to reconstruct neural radiance fields of humans that are photorealistic, capturing fine details of appearance even for things like hair, clothing, etc. - The radiance fields should capture motion, so they are modeling dynamic scenes over long video sequences rather than just static scenes.- The method aims to enable novel view synthesis - generating new photorealistic views of the scene from viewpoints that were not in the input video.- There is a focus on challenges of modeling full human bodies over long sequences, which requires handling complex motions and topology changes.So in summary, the central research question is how to reconstruct high-fidelity neural radiance fields of full human bodies in motion to enable photorealistic rendering of novel views for long video sequences. The paper aims to address challenges of capturing detailed appearance and handling complex motions that arise when modeling humans over long sequences.
