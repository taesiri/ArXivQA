# [Learning 3D Representations from 2D Pre-trained Models via   Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06785)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: Can off-the-shelf 2D pre-trained models help 3D representation learning by transferring robust 2D knowledge into 3D domains?In particular, the authors propose a method called Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoders (I2P-MAE) to leverage 2D pre-trained models to guide the learning of 3D representations. The key ideas are:1) Project 3D point clouds into 2D depth maps and extract features using pre-trained 2D models like ViT. 2) Use 2D-guided masking to select more semantically meaningful points as visible tokens for the 3D MAE encoder. 3) Reconstruct corresponding 2D features from visible tokens after the 3D MAE decoder to transfer 2D knowledge.Through these image-to-point learning schemes, the paper aims to show that 2D pre-trained models can help learn superior 3D representations despite the lack of large-scale 3D datasets, transferring robust knowledge from the 2D domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.In summary, the central hypothesis is that 2D pre-trained models can guide 3D representation learning through image-to-point transfer, which is examined by the proposed I2P-MAE method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoder (I2P-MAE) framework for self-supervised 3D point cloud pre-training. The key ideas are:- Leveraging 2D pre-trained models (e.g. ViT pre-trained on image data) to provide guidance for 3D point cloud pre-training, to alleviate the need for large-scale 3D datasets. - Introducing two image-to-point learning schemes:    1) 2D-guided masking: Using 2D saliency maps to guide the masking of 3D point tokens, preserving more semantically significant points.    2) 2D-semantic reconstruction: Reconstructing 2D visual features from visible 3D point tokens, enabling the model to learn high-level 2D semantics.- Showing that with the proposed image-to-point learning, the I2P-MAE model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape classification, part segmentation, and few-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its superior transfer learning ability.In summary, the key contribution is leveraging 2D pre-trained models to guide 3D point cloud pre-training via image-to-point learning, to obtain better 3D representations without large 3D datasets. The proposed techniques of 2D-guided masking and 2D-semantic reconstruction enable effective transfer of 2D knowledge to 3D.
