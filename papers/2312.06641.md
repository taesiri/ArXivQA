# [Online Decision Making with History-Average Dependent Costs (Extended)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06641)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies online sequential decision making where the costs depend on the time average of past decisions over a finite history horizon. This problem is recast as online optimization with stage-wise constraints coupling the decisions across time steps. The authors propose a novel Follow-The-Adaptively-Regularized-Leader (FTARL) algorithm which uses history-dependent regularizers to enforce constraints while achieving low regret. They show that when the full history affects costs, no algorithm can achieve sublinear regret. However, when history length scales sublinearly as $o(T)$, their method achieves $O(\sqrt{TH})$ regret. The adaptive regularizers play a key role in both enforcing constraints and bounding regret. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate superior performance over prior methods on heterogeneous and cyclic costs, while matching performance on identical stochastic costs. Overall, the paper provides important theoretical and algorithmic insights into online learning problems with historical dependence through averaging.
