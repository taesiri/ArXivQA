# [DeiSAM: Segment Anything with Deictic Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14123)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current neural networks lack the capability to reliably interpret complex, contextual representations referring to objects depending on other objects and relations in a scene (so-called "deictic representations"). This limits their reasoning abilities for tasks like object segmentation based on textual, deictic prompts.  

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose DeiSAM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that combines large pre-trained neural networks like vision-language models with differentiable logic reasoners. The model takes an image and a complex deictic textual prompt as input. It first uses a scene graph generator to extract a graph representation of objects and relations from the image. In parallel, a large language model is used to translate the textual prompt into logical rules. A semantic unification module aligns synonymous terms between the generated rules and scene graph. The rules are then compiled into a differentiable forward reasoner that identifies target objects described in the prompt by logical inference on the scene graph. Finally, a segmentation model extracts and segments the target objects.

Key Contributions:

1) DeiSAM - A new neuro-symbolic framework for object segmentation based on deictic, textual prompts. It combines neural networks like vision-language models and scene graph generators with differentiable logical reasoners.

2) Introduction of Deictic Visual Genome benchmark containing images paired with deictic textual prompts of varying complexity for evaluating deictic segmentation models.

3) Empirical demonstration that DeiSAM outperforms purely neural baselines by a large margin on deictic segmentation tasks.

4) Showcasing that DeiSAM enables end-to-end training to improve segmentation by adapting components like scene graph generators to complex reasoning tasks.
