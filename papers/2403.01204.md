# [Stochastic gradient descent for streaming linear and rectified linear   systems with Massart noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of robust linear and rectified linear unit (ReLU) regression in streaming settings where the data can be corrupted by adversarial outliers. Specifically, the data arrives sequentially, can only be processed once, and a fraction of it may be arbitrarily corrupted. This is challenging because traditional regression methods fail in the presence of outliers. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a stochastic gradient descent method called SGD-exp that uses an exponentially decaying step size. This scheduling enables robustness against corrupted streaming data. SGD-exp minimizes the L1 loss, which promotes sparsity and is more robust compared to L2 loss.

Main Contributions:

1) SGD-exp guarantees nearly linear convergence for corruption probabilities <0.5 under the challenging Massart corruption model, where outliers can depend on the uncorrupted data. This is the best possible rate for this corruption model.

2) Under a weaker oblivious corruption model, SGD-exp converges for any corruption probability <1. This answers an open question on the best possible rate for streaming robust regression.  

3) The paper provides the first convergence guarantees for robust ReLU regression in streaming settings under adversarial corruptions.

4) The analysis introduces a new approach based on discrete stochastic process drifts that may be of independent interest.

5) Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SGD-exp outperforms prior streaming algorithms and is robust to outliers that cause other methods like GLM-Tron to fail.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical and empirical contributions towards the open problem of robust regression under streaming corruptions. The proposed SGD-exp provably converges despite outliers and corruption.
