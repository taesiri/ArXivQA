# [3DHacker: Spectrum-based Decision Boundary Generation for Hard-label 3D   Point Cloud Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07546)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the main research question this paper addresses is: How to generate adversarial point clouds to attack 3D models in a challenging black-box hard-label setting where attackers can only access the predicted labels instead of model details?The key hypothesis is that by exploiting the decision boundary between different classes and fusing point clouds in the spectral domain, the authors can generate high-quality adversarial point clouds with small perturbations to successfully attack 3D models, even without access to model parameters or output logits.Specifically, the main contributions and key ideas of this paper are:- They propose the first adversarial attack method for 3D point clouds in the hard-label black-box setting, which is more practical yet challenging compared to white-box or soft-label black-box settings.- They introduce a spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm to construct the boundary between different classes for searching optimal adversarial samples, which overcomes limitations of prior attacks.- They develop a pipeline with spectrum-fusion to generate high-quality boundary point clouds and an iterative optimization strategy to further refine them along the decision boundary.- Experiments show their attack achieves 100% success rate with small perturbations even without model details, outperforming existing 3D attacks.In summary, the core research question is how to achieve effective 3D point cloud attacks in the practical yet challenging hard-label black-box setting, which they address through a novel spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents 3DHacker, a novel spectrum-based decision boundary attack method for 3D point clouds in the challenging black-box hard-label setting. The main contributions are:1. It proposes the first attack method for 3D point clouds in the hard-label black-box setting, where the attacker can only access the predicted label instead of model details or logits. This is more practical yet difficult compared to white-box or general black-box settings.  2. It introduces a spectrum-based decision boundary generation algorithm to craft high-quality adversarial point clouds on the decision boundary between different classes. This preserves better imperceptibility compared to directly fusing point coordinates.3. It develops a joint coordinate- and spectrum-aware iterative walking strategy to optimize the adversarial point cloud along the decision boundary. This aims to find the optimal point with smallest distortion while overcoming the local optimum problem.4. Experiments show the proposed 3DHacker achieves 100% attack success rate with competitive perturbation magnitude compared to existing attacks, even under the more challenging hard-label setting. It also has stronger transferability and is more robust to defenses.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first specialized decision boundary attack algorithm with point cloud spectrum to enable effective 3D point cloud attack in the practical hard-label black-box setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new adversarial attack method for 3D point clouds called 3DHacker, which generates imperceptible adversarial point clouds in a challenging black-box hard-label setting where the attacker can only access the predicted label of the input. 3DHacker utilizes a spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm to iteratively optimize the adversarial sample along the estimated decision boundary between different classes for achieving a high attack success rate with minimal perturbations.
