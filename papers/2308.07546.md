# [3DHacker: Spectrum-based Decision Boundary Generation for Hard-label 3D   Point Cloud Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07546)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the main research question this paper addresses is: How to generate adversarial point clouds to attack 3D models in a challenging black-box hard-label setting where attackers can only access the predicted labels instead of model details?

The key hypothesis is that by exploiting the decision boundary between different classes and fusing point clouds in the spectral domain, the authors can generate high-quality adversarial point clouds with small perturbations to successfully attack 3D models, even without access to model parameters or output logits.

Specifically, the main contributions and key ideas of this paper are:

- They propose the first adversarial attack method for 3D point clouds in the hard-label black-box setting, which is more practical yet challenging compared to white-box or soft-label black-box settings.

- They introduce a spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm to construct the boundary between different classes for searching optimal adversarial samples, which overcomes limitations of prior attacks.

- They develop a pipeline with spectrum-fusion to generate high-quality boundary point clouds and an iterative optimization strategy to further refine them along the decision boundary.

- Experiments show their attack achieves 100% success rate with small perturbations even without model details, outperforming existing 3D attacks.

In summary, the core research question is how to achieve effective 3D point cloud attacks in the practical yet challenging hard-label black-box setting, which they address through a novel spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents 3DHacker, a novel spectrum-based decision boundary attack method for 3D point clouds in the challenging black-box hard-label setting. The main contributions are:

1. It proposes the first attack method for 3D point clouds in the hard-label black-box setting, where the attacker can only access the predicted label instead of model details or logits. This is more practical yet difficult compared to white-box or general black-box settings.  

2. It introduces a spectrum-based decision boundary generation algorithm to craft high-quality adversarial point clouds on the decision boundary between different classes. This preserves better imperceptibility compared to directly fusing point coordinates.

3. It develops a joint coordinate- and spectrum-aware iterative walking strategy to optimize the adversarial point cloud along the decision boundary. This aims to find the optimal point with smallest distortion while overcoming the local optimum problem.

4. Experiments show the proposed 3DHacker achieves 100% attack success rate with competitive perturbation magnitude compared to existing attacks, even under the more challenging hard-label setting. It also has stronger transferability and is more robust to defenses.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new adversarial attack method for 3D point clouds called 3DHacker, which generates imperceptible adversarial point clouds in a challenging black-box hard-label setting where the attacker can only access the predicted label of the input. 3DHacker utilizes a spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm to iteratively optimize the adversarial sample along the estimated decision boundary between different classes for achieving a high attack success rate with minimal perturbations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a novel method for generating adversarial examples on 3D point clouds in a challenging black-box hard-label attack setting. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work:

- Setting: Most prior work on attacking 3D point clouds operates in either a white-box setting where the attacker has full access to model parameters and gradients, or a black-box setting where the attacker can at least access model logits/confidence scores. This paper tackles a more challenging setting where the attacker can only access the final predicted label.

- Approach: Many previous methods rely on iteratively optimizing perturbations based on model gradients or estimated gradients. Since gradients are unavailable in the hard-label setting, this paper instead estimates the decision boundary between classes and iteratively searches for adversarial examples along this boundary.

- Quality: A key contribution is developing techniques like graph spectral fusion to generate smoother and more imperceptible adversarial point clouds compared to prior work. Many previous attacks suffer from uneven point distributions or outlier points that are easy to detect.

- Effectiveness: Despite the harder setting, experiments show the attack is highly effective, achieving 100% success matched or exceeding white-box attacks in perturbation size. It also demonstrates improved robustness against defenses like statistical outlier removal.

- Limitations: The hard-label setting precludes some optimization techniques used in white-box attacks to further reduce perturbations. And estimating the decision boundary with only labels is inherently noisier than using real gradients.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundary of 3D point cloud attacks into a more challenging but practical setting not previously explored. The novel techniques developed advance the state-of-the-art in crafting imperceptible adversarial examples in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Developing more robust 3D adversarial attacks that can work effectively even with limited knowledge about the victim model (e.g. in a black-box or hard-label setting). The authors propose a new hard-label attack setting and method, but note there is room for improvement.

- Designing more effective defenses against 3D adversarial point clouds, especially defenses that rely less on outlier removal techniques and more on inherent model robustness. The authors show their attack can often bypass outlier removal defenses.

- Improving the imperceptibility and quality of 3D adversarial point clouds. While the authors aim to generate smoother and more natural looking adversarial samples, there is opportunity to further enhance the realism and minimize perceptual distortions. 

- Exploring adversarial attacks and defenses for other 3D modalities beyond point clouds, such as meshes, voxels, and graphs. Extending concepts to other 3D data types presents additional challenges.

- Applying insights from 3D adversarial learning to improve robustness and security in real-world applications like autonomous driving, robotics, 3D scanning, etc. Bridging the gap between academic attacks/defenses and industry usage.

In summary, the main future directions focus on developing more effective and practical adversarial techniques for 3D vision tasks, improving perceptual quality, and transferring the knowledge to impact real-world systems. Advancing the robustness and security of 3D learning systems through adversarial techniques is an important open problem.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called 3DHacker for generating adversarial point clouds under challenging black-box hard-label settings where the attacker only has access to the predicted label of the model, without any knowledge of model parameters or logits. 3DHacker generates high-quality adversarial point clouds by first fusing source and target point clouds in the spectral domain to construct candidate clouds on the decision boundary, then selecting the best candidate and projecting it onto the boundary via binary search. To further optimize the boundary cloud, it iteratively moves along the decision boundary using a joint coordinate- and spectrum-walking strategy to find the optimal place with smallest perturbation. Experiments show 3DHacker achieves 100% attack success rates with competitive perturbations compared to white-box attacks, validating its effectiveness even under the hard-label setting. The spectrum fusion and walking strategies are key innovations to generate smooth adversarial point clouds while overcoming local optimum problems during optimization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called 3DHacker for generating adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds in a challenging black-box hard-label setting. In this setting, attackers can only access the predicted label of a point cloud instead of model details or output scores. Previous 3D attacks rely on white-box access or output scores, making them impractical in real applications. To tackle the hard-label setting, 3DHacker exploits the decision boundary between classes to craft adversarial point clouds with minimal perturbations. 

The key idea is to fuse benign and target point clouds in the spectral domain to generate candidate clouds on the decision boundary. This preserves geometric shape better than fusing in the coordinate domain. 3DHacker then optimizes the boundary cloud via iterative walking to find the best adversarial example with smallest distortion. A joint coordinate and spectrum walking strategy helps avoid poor local optima. Experiments show 3DHacker achieves 100% attack success with competitive perturbations compared to white-box attacks, even in the hard-label setting. It also resists defenses better than a state-of-the-art black-box attack.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel spectrum-based decision boundary attack method called 3DHacker for generating adversarial point clouds in the challenging hard-label black-box setting. The key idea is to construct the class-aware model decision boundary between different point cloud classes, and search along the boundary to find the adversarial sample with minimum perturbation from the source point cloud. 

Specifically, the attack consists of two main steps:

1) Boundary-cloud generation with spectrum-fusion: Instead of fusing point clouds in the coordinate domain, the authors propose a spectrum-fusion method to preserve geometry. They transform source and target clouds into spectral domain via Graph Fourier Transform, fuse their spectrums with different weights for low and high frequencies, and transform back to obtain candidate adversarial clouds on decision boundary. The best cloud with least distortion is selected.  

2) Boundary-cloud optimization along decision boundary: To find the optimized adversarial cloud on the decision boundary, both coordinate-wise and spectrum-wise iterative walking strategies are used - coordinate walking for fine-tuning shape and spectrum walking for overcoming local optima. The final optimized cloud after iterative walking is the adversarial sample.

In summary, the key novelty is using spectral representations and decision boundary algorithm to craft imperceptible adversarial point clouds in the challenging hard-label black-box attack setting. Experiments show the effectiveness of 3DHacker compared to existing methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating adversarial examples for 3D point cloud classification models in a challenging black-box hard-label attack setting. 

Specifically, it focuses on the following issues:

- Most existing 3D attack methods rely on white-box access to model details or black-box access to logit outputs. These settings are less practical in real applications where model details are hidden from users.

- The quality of adversarial point clouds generated by prior arts is limited, often resulting in irregular surfaces or outlier points that are easily perceivable. 

- Directly adapting 2D decision boundary attack methods to 3D point clouds faces challenges like maintaining geometric shape when fusing point clouds and avoiding local optima during optimization.

To tackle these issues, the paper proposes a novel spectrum-based decision boundary attack method called 3DHacker that can generate high quality adversarial point clouds with minimal perturbations using only the predicted labels. The key ideas include:

- Fusing source and target point clouds in spectral domain to preserve shape instead of naive coordinate averaging.

- Iteratively optimizing the adversarial point cloud along the estimated decision boundary via both coordinate-wise and spectrum-wise walking to find the best solution.

So in summary, the paper focuses on the very practical but challenging problem of black-box hard-label attack on 3D point clouds, and proposes innovations in decision boundary estimation and optimization to achieve imperceptible adversarial examples in this setting.
