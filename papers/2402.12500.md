# [Integrating kNN with Foundation Models for Adaptable and Privacy-Aware   Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional deep learning models store knowledge implicitly in their weights, limiting transparency and adaptability. This makes it difficult to update the models to address privacy concerns or evolving data.
- Fine-tuning models on new data risks catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. Continual learning approaches to mitigate this also lock knowledge in model weights.  
- Regulations like GDPR give users rights over their data, including deleting it from models. Existing models cannot easily accommodate this without full retraining.

Proposed Solution: 
- Store feature embeddings from training data separately from model weights, enabling dynamic updates without retraining.
- Use a kNN classifier for classification based on similarity of embeddings between query and stored support images. 
- Employ a vision-based foundation model (DINOv2) pre-trained in a self-supervised way as the feature extractor backbone.

Main Contributions:
- Open-source implementation and validation of prior unpublished work on kNN with foundation models.
- Enhanced performance using DINOv2 backbone over prior work.
- Show strong performance on natural and medical image datasets.
- Confirm robustness for continual learning by incrementally expanding classes or samples without forgetting.
- Show ability to remove random or most "valuable" samples per class with minimal performance drop.
- Demonstrate applicability for medical imaging use cases needing data privacy and incremental learning.

In summary, the paper proposes an adaptable kNN-based approach using foundation model embeddings to enable incremental learning and data privacy while achieving strong classification accuracy across domains. The open-source release facilitates further research.
