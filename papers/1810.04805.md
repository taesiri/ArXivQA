# [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether pre-training deep bidirectional representations can improve performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. 

The key hypothesis is that pre-training a deep bidirectional Transformer model using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives allows the model to learn powerful representations that can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks.

Specifically, the paper introduces BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained bidirectional Transformer model. The goal is to demonstrate that BERT representations lead to substantial gains across a diverse set of NLP tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications.

The paper validates this hypothesis by fine-tuning BERT on eleven natural language processing tasks and showing it achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks like question answering, textual entailment, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. The strong empirical results across multiple benchmark datasets support the claim that deep bidirectional pre-training provides significant benefits for language understanding.

In summary, the key research question is whether bidirectional pre-training can boost performance across various NLP tasks, which the authors affirm through pre-training BERT and fine-tuning it for downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing BERT, a new language representation model based on the Transformer architecture. BERT is pretrained on large unlabeled text corpora using two novel unsupervised prediction tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This pretraining allows BERT to learn deep bidirectional representations that can then be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks. 

The key innovations are:

- BERT uses masked language modeling to enable pretraining a deep bidirectional Transformer encoder, overcoming the constraint of previous models like ELMo and OpenAI GPT that used shallow concatenation of left-to-right and right-to-left models or unidirectional architectures.

- BERT introduces a "next sentence prediction" pretraining task to better model sentence relationships and understand document structure.

- The same BERT model architecture can be used for both pretraining and downstream tasks by simply swapping the inputs and outputs. Minimal task-specific parameters need to be learned from scratch.

- BERT achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of NLP tasks like GLUE, SQuAD question answering, and named entity recognition by fine-tuning the same pretrained model. The transfer learning enabled by BERT's pretraining significantly reduces the need for heavily engineered task-specific architectures.

In summary, BERT's innovation is in pretraining a deep bidirectional Transformer model using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, which creates representations that transfer well across different NLP tasks through fine-tuning. This simplicity and effectiveness is the main contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces BERT, a deep bidirectional Transformer model pretrained on large unlabeled text corpora using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, which achieves state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned on a wide range of NLP tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this BERT paper compares to related work in pre-training language representation models:

- Approach: BERT introduces a new pre-training objective, Masked LM, that allows bidirectional pre-training. This is unlike previous models like ELMo and OpenAI GPT that used unidirectional language modeling objectives. The bidirectional approach allows BERT to fuse left and right context which helps for many downstream tasks.

- Performance: The paper shows state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks using the same pre-trained BERT model. For example, it achieved a 7.7% average accuracy gain over prior models on the GLUE benchmark. This demonstrated the versatility of BERT compared to more task-specific models.

- Model Architecture: BERT uses the Transformer architecture from attention is all you need. This was an advance over LSTM-based models like ELMo. The Transformer can better capture long-range dependencies. BERT also scaled up the model size substantially compared to prior work, showing benefits.

- Pre-training Data: BERT was pre-trained on a larger corpus than prior work like OpenAI GPT, using both BooksCorpus and Wikipedia rather than just BooksCorpus. This larger and more diverse dataset likely contributed to its strong performance.

- Transfer Learning: Unlike ELMo's feature-based approach, BERT showed the effectiveness of fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model on downstream tasks. This end-to-end fine-tuning worked better than feature extraction.

Overall, BERT advanced the state-of-the-art by enabling bidirectional pre-training at scale and showing how transfer learning via fine-tuning could work extremely well for NLP. Many subsequent models have built on BERT's innovations and achieved even better results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion:

- Explore other methods of pre-training deeper bidirectional representations beyond masked language modeling, such as using latent variable models. 

- Apply BERT to a broader range of tasks like coreference resolution and relation extraction.

- Investigate transfer learning from other large-scale supervised tasks besides language modeling.

- Understand which factors contribute the most to BERT's effectiveness, through further ablation studies.

- Scale up even further, as the authors found that model size leads to significant gains even on small datasets. They suggest exploring larger models, more training data, longer sequences, and different model architectures.

- Adapt BERT to other languages by pre-training on large monolingual corpora.

- Leverage model compression techniques like distillation to pre-train and deploy smaller versions of BERT.

The key future directions seem to be exploring alternate pre-training objectives, applying BERT to more tasks, investigating the source of BERT's performance through ablation studies, and adapting BERT to more languages and lower-resource settings. The authors also emphasize the importance of scaling up model size and data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces BERT, a new language representation model based on bidirectional Transformers. Unlike previous models which are either unidirectional or only combine left-to-right and right-to-left context at a shallow level, BERT is deeply bidirectional - it uses masked language modeling to enable pre-trained representations that combine left and right context in every layer. The authors show that this approach is far more effective than previous techniques. BERT obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks, including pushing GLUE benchmark scores to 80.5%, reaching 93.2 F1 on SQuAD question answering, and achieving 86.3% accuracy on the challenging SWAG natural language inference dataset. The paper demonstrates that large pre-trained bidirectional models can significantly advance the state-of-the-art across many NLP tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces BERT, a bidirectional transformer model for language representation. Unlike previous unidirectional language models like ELMo and OpenAI GPT, BERT is trained using two novel unsupervised prediction tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. In masked language modeling, some percentage of input tokens are randomly masked and the model tries to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked words based on context. In next sentence prediction, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original document. 

Pre-training BERT on large amounts of unlabeled text data improves performance when fine-tuned on a wide variety of NLP tasks including GLUE, SQuAD question answering, and SWAG language inference. The authors show that BERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on these tasks by a significant margin, demonstrating the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language understanding. Ablation studies indicate that both masked language modeling and next sentence prediction contribute substantially to the performance gains. The code and pre-trained models for BERT are made publicly available.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces BERT, a new language representation model that is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. The key innovation is the use of two new unsupervised pre-training tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). In MLM, some percentage of input tokens are randomly masked and the model must predict the original vocabulary id of the masked words based only on context. This enables deeply bidirectional representation learning. The NSP task trains text pair representations by predicting whether two input sentences are consecutive or not. After pre-training on large unlabeled corpora using these two tasks, BERT is fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks by adding just a single additional output layer. This unified architecture allows BERT to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks with minimal task-specific modifications.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper introduces BERT, a new language representation model based on bidirectional Transformers. The key problems/questions it aims to address are:

- Most prior work on learning language representations uses unidirectional models like left-to-right or right-to-left. This limits their ability to incorporate context from both directions. BERT aims to pre-train deep bidirectional representations to overcome this limitation.

- Prior work has generally used task-specific architectures for different NLP tasks. BERT aims to show that a single pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks without substantial architectural modifications. 

- BERT aims to advance the state-of-the-art on a diverse set of NLP tasks like question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, etc. by leveraging deep bidirectional pre-training.

In summary, the key focus is on enabling deep bidirectional pre-training and showing its effectiveness on a wide array of NLP tasks through minimal task-specific fine-tuning. The paper demonstrates significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art across 11 NLP tasks.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper introduces BERT, a new pre-training method for natural language processing tasks. BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike previous models that use left-to-right or shallow concatenation of left-to-right and right-to-left models, BERT is the first fine-tuning based representation model that is deeply bidirectional. 

BERT is pre-trained on two unsupervised prediction tasks. The first is masked language modeling, where random tokens are masked and the model must predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. The second is next sentence prediction, where the model receives pairs of sentences and predicts if the second sentence is the actual next one in the original text. 

The authors show that BERT outperforms other pre-trained models like ELMo and OpenAI GPT on a diverse range of NLP tasks including GLUE, SQuAD question answering, and SWAG. For example, BERT obtains a GLUE score of 80.5 compared to 72.8 for OpenAI GPT. The advantages are especially large for small datasets. The pre-trained representations can be easily fine-tuned by adding just one additional output layer, making it simple to apply BERT to new tasks.
