# [Dynamic Graph Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06716)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Dynamic graphs with complex spatial and temporal patterns are prevalent in real-world applications like social networks and traffic networks. Learning effective representations for them is challenging.
- Existing dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have limited robustness and are prone to adversarial attacks due to over-smoothing and aggregation of irrelevant node features.
- Extending information bottleneck (IB) principle to dynamic graphs is difficult due to violation of i.i.d. assumption and intractable optimization of IB objectives.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose Dynamic Graph Information Bottleneck (DGIB) framework to learn robust and discriminative dynamic graph representations.

- Decompose overall IB objective into DGIB_{MS} and DGIB_{C} channels:
    - DGIB_{MS} captures minimal and sufficient info to predict target. 
    - DGIB_{C} adds consensual constraint for predictive consensus.

- Propose Minimal-Sufficient-Consensual (MSC) condition for optimal representations. DGIB_{MS} and DGIB_{C} jointly satisfy this.

- Derive tractable variational upper and lower bounds to optimize intractable IB objectives.

- Iteratively refine graph structures and features across snapshots to compress redundant information.

Main Contributions:
- First work to extend IB principle to dynamic graphs with structures directly involved in optimization.
- Propose MSC condition and DGIB framework with DGIB_{MS} and DGIB_{C} channels to meet it. 
- Tractable optimization of intractable IB objectives on dynamic graphs.
- Experiments show superior robustness over state-of-the-art methods on real-world graphs against adversarial attacks.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel DGIB framework to learn robust dynamic graph representations by extending IB principle using decomposed objectives and tractable variational bounds. Experiments validate effectiveness.
