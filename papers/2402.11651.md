# [Learning From Failure: Integrating Negative Examples when Fine-tuning   Large Language Models as Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) as agents by using only successful interaction trajectories leads to wasted data and computational resources, as failed trajectories are simply discarded. 
- LLMs are not inherently optimized for acting as agents that can effectively use tools and make decisions. Simply using prompting is limited in improving their capabilities.

Method: 
- Propose negative-aware training (NAT) to incorporate failed interaction trajectories when fine-tuning LLMs as agents, based on the intuition that humans learn from failures.  
- NAT involves data collection, cleaning, reformatting trajectories into positive and negative examples, and fine-tuning.
- Key idea is to differentiate between successful and failed trajectories when fine-tuning via different prompting.  

Experiments:
- Assessed on mathematical reasoning, HotpotQA, and StrategyQA datasets.
- Show NAT outperforms fine-tuning with only positive trajectories across tasks. It also beats directly combining positive and negative trajectories through implicit contrastive learning.
- Analysis reveals: 1) Quality of negative examples impacts effectiveness 2) Models learn similar knowledge from negative vs. additional positive examples 3) Benefit diminishes as more positive data is available.

Contributions:
- First work to demonstrate and leverage the value of failed interaction trajectories in fine-tuning LLMs as agents.  
- Proposed simple but effective NAT strategy and validated its broad applicability across tasks.
- Analysis provided insights into how and when models can learn effectively from negative examples.

Let me know if you would like me to expand or clarify any part of this summary further.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a negative-aware training approach that allows large language models to effectively learn from both positive and negative examples when fine-tuned as agents, enhancing performance on tasks like mathematical reasoning and question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. The authors demonstrate the value of negative trajectories and introduce a negative-aware training approach, allowing LLM-based trained agents to effectively learn from both positive and negative examples.

2. They validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of learning from negative examples, and show that it enables models to acquire information akin to positive examples across various tasks and prompting strategies.

In other words, the key contributions are showing that language models can learn from failure when fine-tuned as agents, and proposing a simple yet effective negative-aware training method to integrate failed trajectories when fine-tuning agents. Experiments across mathematical reasoning and question answering tasks demonstrate the benefits of this approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that negative trajectories account for over 50% of samples generated by GPT-4. Is there an optimal ratio between positive and negative trajectories that maximizes model performance? How does this ratio vary based on factors like model size, task complexity, etc.?

2. The paper conducts task-specific data cleaning before incorporating negative trajectories. What are some best practices and guidelines for cleaning negative trajectories across different tasks? How can we automate and scale data cleaning?  

3. The paper shows diminishing returns in performance as more negative trajectories are added. Is there a theoretical justification for why this effect occurs? Could transfer learning hypothetically overcome this limitation?

4. The paper demonstrates the importance of negative trajectory quality on model performance. What specific properties constitute high vs low quality negative trajectories? Are certain types of mistakes more instructive than others?

5. The perplexity analysis indicates models do not learn the full spectrum of knowledge from negative vs positive trajectories. What is the nature of the persistent gap, and are there ways to narrow it? 

6. The paper suggests ideal negative sample ratios depend on positive sample saturation and negative sample quality. Can we model this relationship quantitatively? Are there other factors to consider?  

7. For chain-of-thought prompting, what adjustments need to be made to effectively leverage negative trajectories compared to standard prompting formats?

8. How well does negative-aware training transfer to different downstream tasks compared to models trained solely on positive trajectories?

9. Can the gains from negative-aware training transfer to other model architectures besides LLaMA? What adjustments may be required?

10. The paper focuses on supervised learning from trajectories. Could similar ideas be applied in a reinforcement learning paradigm to learn from environmental rewards and penalties?
