# [PROXYQA: An Alternative Framework for Evaluating Long-Form Text   Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15042)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces ProxyQA, a framework for evaluating large language models' ability to generate long-form text by using human-curated meta-questions and corresponding proxy-questions with annotated answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of ProxyQA, a framework for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate long-form text. Specifically:

- ProxyQA includes human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each with a corresponding set of proxy-questions and answers. 

- To evaluate an LLM's generated text for a meta-question, an evaluator uses that text as background and attempts to answer the proxy-questions. Performance on answering the proxy-questions indicates the quality and informativeness of the generated text.

- This approach eliminates the need for gold-standard reference texts or expert evaluators. The proxy-questions enable assessment by non-experts and help handle the subjectivity issues in human evaluation.

- ProxyQA is applied to test various LLMs and demonstrates its rigor in assessment. It also shows the gap between open-source and proprietary models.

- Analysis demonstrates ProxyQA's high self-consistency and strong correlation with human evaluation preferences, unlike other automated methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing ProxyQA as an alternative yet reliable framework for evaluating long-form text generation capabilities of large language models.

The paper introduces a new framework called ProxyQA for evaluating the ability of LLMs to generate long-form text. It uses human-curated meta-questions and corresponding proxy-questions with annotated answers. The quality of the text generated by LLMs in response to meta-questions is evaluated by how well an evaluator can answer the proxy-questions based on that text. This avoids issues with traditional evaluation methods like automated metrics and crowdsourcing. The paper tests different LLMs with ProxyQA and does analysis on dimensions like domain and robustness. It also compares against human evaluation to demonstrate ProxyQA's reliability and consistency. So the main focus is on this alternative evaluation framework for long-form text generation using proxy-questions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What motivated the authors to develop ProxyQA as an alternative evaluation framework compared to existing methods that rely on gold references or human evaluation? How does ProxyQA address some of the key limitations with current approaches?

2. Could you elaborate more on the process and rationale behind creating the meta-questions? What criteria did the authors use to ensure these are high-quality, answerable questions spanning diverse domains?  

3. The proxy-questions seem essential to ProxyQA's ability to evaluate informativeness and coverage. What steps did the authors take during the annotation process to guarantee the proxy-questions sufficiently capture the pivotal content?

4. ProxyQA appears to eliminate the risk of training data contamination through its data collection and annotation process. Could you explain how it achieves this and why it is an advantage over prior datasets?

5. Instead of having human experts directly evaluate the generated texts, ProxyQA uses LLMs like GPT-4 as proxy evaluators. What is the motivation behind this approach? What steps were taken to validate the consistency between the LLM evaluators and human judgment?

6. How does the level of difficulty and domain category of the meta-questions impact the performance of different LLMs? What insights did this provide about the strengths and weaknesses of large parametric vs non-parametric LLMs?

7. Why does augmenting LLMs with retrieval mechanisms like ReAct surprisingly lower performance on ProxyQA? What hypothesis do the authors present to explain this unexpected result?

8. ProxyQA introduces a multi-round annotation process to test robustness across expert preferences. Could you analyze the purpose and outcomes of evaluating model performance on expert-consolidated vs single-expert proxy question sets?

9. When analyzing human vs ProxyQA agreements rates in Table 5, what conclusions can be drawn about the consistency and validity of this new evaluation framework compared to crowdsourcing? 

10. Do you think ProxyQA could be adapted or extended to provide insights into long-form text comprehension and summarization? What other potential applications or future work do you foresee with this approach?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new framework called ProxyQA for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate long-form text. Generating informative long-form content like reports and articles is an important capability for LLMs that has not been sufficiently studied. 

Existing evaluation methods for long-form text generation have significant limitations. Comparing to reference texts relies on unavailable gold standards in many generation tasks. Automated metrics struggle to handle unstructured, diverse outputs. Human evaluation lacks expertise or is inconsistent. Recent LLM evaluators also face inconsistency and lack current information.

To address this, ProxyQA includes 100 diverse, expert-curated meta-questions that require comprehensive, long-form answers. Each meta-question has corresponding proxy-questions with annotated answers that aim to capture the key topics to address. 

LLMs are prompted to generate detailed responses to the meta-questions. Then an evaluator, either human or LLM, leverages the generated text to answer the proxy-questions. If the generated text equips the evaluator with sufficient accurate information to answer all proxy-questions, it indicates high quality.

Key benefits are: eliminates need for gold references, enables non-expert evaluation, and prevents training data contamination since proxy-questions/answers are hidden. Multiple LLMs (LLaMA, GPT variants) and strategies (retrieval, reasoning) are tested, showing the framework's demanding nature.  

Systematic human evaluation demonstrates ProxyQA provides highly self-consistent scores that strongly correlate with majority human preference. Over 88% self-agreement and 63% agreement with humans is achieved.

In summary, ProxyQA offers a robust way to assess and drive progress in long-form text generation using expert-curated questions and proxy-based evaluation. The data and leaderboard will be publicly released.
