# [EnCoMP: Enhanced Covert Maneuver Planning using Offline Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous navigation in complex outdoor environments is challenging, requiring robots to reach goals while minimizing exposure to threats by utilizing cover.  
- Existing methods have limitations in leveraging sensor data to understand cover, rely on simplified environments/supervision, or have sim-to-real transfer issues.

Proposed Solution:
- Presents EnCoMP, an enhanced covert maneuver planning framework using multi-modal perception and offline reinforcement learning.

Key Contributions:

1. Novel integration of LiDAR data for covert navigation by generating cover, threat, and height maps to explicitly enhance understanding of cover in the environment. 

2. Advanced multi-modal perception pipeline fusing LiDAR-based height and cover density maps to enable more informed navigation decisions compared to single-modality perception.

3. Leverages offline reinforcement learning with multi-modal map representation as input to learn policies from diverse real-world data. Addresses sim-to-real transfer issues faced by online learning approaches.

- Reward functions designed to encourage cover utilization, threat avoidance, goal progress, and collision avoidance.

- Evaluated extensively in real-world experiments across diverse environments and shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art in metrics like success rate, exposure minimization, cover utilization and efficiency.

In summary, the key innovation is the tight integration of multi-modal perception to generate high-fidelity environmental representations combined with offline reinforcement learning to learn an enhanced policy for covert navigation in complex outdoor environments.
