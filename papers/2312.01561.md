# [Multi-View Person Matching and 3D Pose Estimation with Arbitrary   Uncalibrated Camera Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01561)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a method called PME for jointly solving the problems of cross-view person matching and 3D human pose estimation using only input from multiple video streams captured by uncalibrated cameras. The key idea is to first match people across the different video views in 2D using a robust clustering approach combined with discriminative spatio-temporal person representations. This is achieved through a multi-step constrained clustering algorithm and a "max of sign voting" scheme to create distinctive features for each person track. Once cross-view matches are established, 3D poses can be estimated by associating the matched 2D poses and applying multi-view geometry. A notable advantage of this method is that it does not require pre-calibrated camera poses or expensive 3D training data. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, including both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with four arbitrarily positioned cameras. The experiments show that the approach generalizes very well across different environments and camera setups. The paper also discusses an application to virtual reality, where realistic 3D augmentations can be achieved using only the estimated camera and human poses. Overall, this is a novel approach for tackling important vision problems without relying on calibration or annotation.
