# [Welcome Your New AI Teammate: On Safety Analysis by Leashing Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Safety analysis like Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but is time-consuming. 
- This slows down the rapid iterate-test-improve loops needed for continuous development and deployment of new capabilities (DevOps).
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential to automate intellectual NL-based tasks like HARA. But their capabilities for safety analysis are unexplored.

Proposed Solution:  
- Design a pipeline of carefully engineered prompts to guide an LLM through the multiple steps needed to perform HARA. 
- Apply design science approach through iterative refinement of prompts and pipeline based on internal review by researchers.
- Use chatGPT as a proof of concept for HARA of a novel collision avoidance function, without human intervention during the process.

Contributions:
- Identification of effective prompt patterns for better communication with LLMs on safety analysis.
- First systematic study on autonomous HARA generation capabilities of LLMs.
- Designed and iteratively refined a prompting pipeline to propagate context for HARA without human intervention.
- Showed the feasibility of using LLMs to create a "version zero" HARA for accelerating the development process. 
- Proposed future independent expert evaluation and improvements based on their feedback.

In summary, the paper explores the potential for large language models to accelerate hazard analysis in autonomous vehicles through carefully designed prompts. A prompting pipeline is created and iteratively refined to enable fully automated analysis. This shows the feasibility of using AI to generate an initial HARA for subsequent review and refinement by engineers.
