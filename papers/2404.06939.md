# [Fast System Technology Co-Optimization Framework for Emerging Technology   Based on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional system technology co-optimization (STCO) is iterative and time-consuming, prolonging the development process. Key challenges include:
1) Time-intensive TCAD simulations for device optimization
2) Lack of standardized compact models for emerging technologies 
3) Complexities in cell library characterization with new technologies and process variations

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a fast STCO framework to accelerate the technology-level tasks using AI techniques:  

1) GNN-based TCAD surrogate model: Encodes device features into a graph and uses node/graph regression for Poisson emulation and IV prediction. Achieves over 100x speedup and high accuracy.

2) Unified compact model: Models mobility variations in emerging technologies like CNT, IGZO, LTPS. Validated against measured I-V curves. Enables parameter extraction.

3) GNN-based cell library model: Uses GCN and MLP to characterize cell libraries with 9 metrics under different corners and technology settings. High accuracy for both combinational and sequential cells.

Main Contributions:
1) Over 100x acceleration of TCAD simulation and cell characterization
2) Unified compact model supporting multiple emerging technologies 
3) Validations on extensive benchmark designs in CNT technology
4) Adaptability to other technologies beyond CNT
5) Integrated framework linking accelerated models via compact model
6) Speedups ranging from 1.9X to 14.1X per STCO iteration over traditional flows

In summary, the paper presents a fast STCO framework, focused on accelerating technology-level tasks, that integrates GNN-based TCAD and cell models with a unified compact model. Comprehensive validation demonstrates significant speedups, supporting accelerated, iterative co-optimization across emerging technologies.
