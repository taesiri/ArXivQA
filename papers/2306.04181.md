# [Benchmarking Foundation Models with Language-Model-as-an-Examiner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04181)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:

How can language models be utilized as examiners to reliably benchmark foundation models in an open-ended question answering setting, while mitigating issues such as testing leakage, evaluation automation challenges, and potential biases?

The authors propose using language models in the role of "examiners" that can generate questions to test other models, as well as evaluate the responses in a reference-free manner. Their framework, referred to as Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, aims to address key limitations in existing benchmarking pipelines for foundation models. Specifically, the authors investigate strategies to:

1) Increase knowledge breadth and depth when generating questions, in order to comprehensively probe the capabilities of foundation models.

2) Develop reliable automatic evaluation measurements, such as scoring and ranking, that align closely with human judgments. 

3) Incorporate peer-examination between multiple models to mitigate potential biases that could arise from relying on a single examiner model.

In essence, the central hypothesis is that by leveraging language models as knowledgeable examiners that can continuously formulate updated questions and provide reference-free assessments, the authors' proposed benchmarking framework can overcome critical challenges faced by previous benchmarking methodologies for open-ended question answering. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated through experiments on popular foundation models.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner that uses language models to generate questions, evaluate responses in a reference-free manner, and conduct decentralized peer-evaluations to mitigate biases, allowing for an extensible and comprehensive evaluation of foundation models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of benchmarking and evaluating foundation models:

- The approach of using a language model examiner to both generate questions and evaluate responses is novel. Most prior benchmarking efforts rely solely on pre-existing datasets or human evaluation. Utilizing LMs for both question generation and scoring is an innovative way to create more dynamic, scalable, and reliable benchmarks.

- The focus on mitigating testing leakage and automating evaluation addresses clear limitations in many existing benchmarks. Testing leakage is a known issue as models may have seen testing data during pretraining. Automated evaluation also remains a challenge, so leveraging LMs is a promising approach.

- The strategies proposed to improve knowledge breadth/depth and ensure fair evaluation are important contributions not seen in previous benchmarks. Generating diversified questions across domains and cognitive levels provides more comprehensive testing. The peer-examination mechanism also helps reduce potential biases.

- Overall, this work pushes forward the state-of-the-art in foundation model benchmarking through its examiner framework, strategies to mitigate limitations, and novel peer-evaluation approach. The benchmark seems more robust and less prone to limitations than many existing options.

- One area where more research may be needed is in detecting and mitigating potential biases or limitations of the LM examiners themselves. But overall, this paper introduces useful innovations that advance the sophistication of benchmarking techniques for foundation models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different prompt design strategies for the examiner model to generate high-quality and diverse questions across knowledge domains. The authors mention this could help create more comprehensive benchmark datasets.

- Developing more advanced natural language generation evaluation capabilities in foundation models to facilitate large-scale peer-examination with many examiner models. The authors note current limitations in the number of models that can reliably conduct evaluations. 

- Leveraging the proposed frameworks to create benchmarks spanning diverse tasks beyond question answering, such as summarization, translation, and dialogue.

- Analyzing and mitigating potential biases in examiner models during question generation and evaluation. The authors recognize examiner bias as an issue to be further explored.

- Incorporating conversational context and history into the multi-round question-asking process to engage in more natural dialogue evaluations.

- Evaluating how well current foundation models acquire and localize knowledge compared to humans through behavioral testing paradigms.

- Exploring metrics beyond scoring and ranking for open-ended language generation tasks that offer more nuanced performance measurement.

In summary, the authors recommend research directions focused on prompt engineering, model scaling, mitigating bias, expanding task coverage, conversational QA, human evaluation comparisons, and novel evaluation metrics. Advancing these areas could further improve benchmarking processes for foundation models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner to assess foundation models on open-ended question answering. This framework uses a language model as an examiner to generate questions based on its knowledge across diverse domains and evaluate other models' responses in a reference-free manner. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, the examiner poses questions probing both breadth and depth of knowledge. The evaluation combines scoring and ranking measurements which closely correlate with human judgments. To address potential bias from a single examiner model, a decentralized peer-examination approach is introduced where multiple models evaluate each other. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmarking pipeline on several foundation models. The framework helps mitigate issues like testing leakage and evaluation automation in existing QA benchmarks while ensuring more reliable and equitable assessment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner to assess foundation models on open-ended question answering. The key idea is to utilize language models not just as evaluators to score responses, but as knowledgeable examiners that generate questions based on their understanding. This addresses issues in previous benchmarking pipelines regarding testing leakage and evaluation automation. Three strategies are proposed for more comprehensive and fair evaluation: 1) Increasing knowledge breadth by generating diversified questions across domains, and knowledge depth via follow-up questions; 2) Adopting scoring and ranking metrics that align closely with human judgments; 3) A decentralized peer-examination mechanism that mitigates bias from a single examiner model. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmarking pipeline on several popular foundation models. The results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of current models, emphasizing the need for more deliberate evaluation techniques. The authors highlight the effortless scalability of their framework as more advanced foundation models emerge.

In summary, this paper puts forth an innovative benchmarking methodology for open-ended QA that harnesses the knowledge and evaluation capabilities of language models. By constructing datasets using the models themselves as examiners, and devising multi-faceted assessment strategies, the work aims to enable more comprehensive and equitable evaluations of foundation models. The proposed techniques help uncover nuances between state-of-the-art models and provide direction for future progress.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, where language models are utilized as knowledgeable examiners to generate questions that test the capabilities of other language models. The examiner model poses questions across diverse domains and evaluates the responses from other models in a reference-free manner, assigning scores based on accuracy, coherence, factuality and comprehensiveness. To ensure a comprehensive assessment, the examiner generates follow-up questions on correctly answered topics to probe deeper understanding. The paper also introduces a decentralized peer-examination mechanism where multiple language models take turns acting as examiners and assessing each other to mitigate potential biases. The benchmark is tested on several popular foundation models and demonstrates its effectiveness in evaluating knowledge breadth and depth in an automated manner while also balancing fairness across examiners.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem/question it is addressing is:

How to develop a more comprehensive, unbiased, and scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate foundation models on open-ended question answering. 

The paper identifies two main issues with existing benchmarking pipelines for assessing foundation models:

1) Testing leakage - As models are pretrained on increasing amounts of data, they may have already seen the answers to test questions, leading to overestimated performance.

2) Evaluation automation - Evaluating freeform textual responses is challenging to automate, so benchmarks often use multiple choice instead of open-ended questions. But this differs from real usage.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, which uses the language model itself to generate diverse questions across domains based on its knowledge, and evaluate responses in a reference-free manner. 

The paper also proposes strategies like multi-round follow-up questions, scoring/ranking metrics, and a decentralized peer-examination mechanism to provide more comprehensive and fair assessments.

In summary, the key problem is developing an improved benchmarking methodology to more effectively evaluate foundation models on open-ended QA in a scalable, comprehensive and unbiased manner. The proposed Language-Model-as-an-Examiner framework aims to address the limitations of existing benchmarking approaches.
