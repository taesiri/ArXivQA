# [Benchmarking Foundation Models with Language-Model-as-an-Examiner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04181)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:

How can language models be utilized as examiners to reliably benchmark foundation models in an open-ended question answering setting, while mitigating issues such as testing leakage, evaluation automation challenges, and potential biases?

The authors propose using language models in the role of "examiners" that can generate questions to test other models, as well as evaluate the responses in a reference-free manner. Their framework, referred to as Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, aims to address key limitations in existing benchmarking pipelines for foundation models. Specifically, the authors investigate strategies to:

1) Increase knowledge breadth and depth when generating questions, in order to comprehensively probe the capabilities of foundation models.

2) Develop reliable automatic evaluation measurements, such as scoring and ranking, that align closely with human judgments. 

3) Incorporate peer-examination between multiple models to mitigate potential biases that could arise from relying on a single examiner model.

In essence, the central hypothesis is that by leveraging language models as knowledgeable examiners that can continuously formulate updated questions and provide reference-free assessments, the authors' proposed benchmarking framework can overcome critical challenges faced by previous benchmarking methodologies for open-ended question answering. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated through experiments on popular foundation models.

The paper proposes a new benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner that uses language models to generate questions, evaluate responses in a reference-free manner, and conduct decentralized peer-evaluations to mitigate biases, allowing for an extensible and comprehensive evaluation of foundation models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of benchmarking and evaluating foundation models:

- The approach of using a language model examiner to both generate questions and evaluate responses is novel. Most prior benchmarking efforts rely solely on pre-existing datasets or human evaluation. Utilizing LMs for both question generation and scoring is an innovative way to create more dynamic, scalable, and reliable benchmarks.

- The focus on mitigating testing leakage and automating evaluation addresses clear limitations in many existing benchmarks. Testing leakage is a known issue as models may have seen testing data during pretraining. Automated evaluation also remains a challenge, so leveraging LMs is a promising approach.

- The strategies proposed to improve knowledge breadth/depth and ensure fair evaluation are important contributions not seen in previous benchmarks. Generating diversified questions across domains and cognitive levels provides more comprehensive testing. The peer-examination mechanism also helps reduce potential biases.

- Overall, this work pushes forward the state-of-the-art in foundation model benchmarking through its examiner framework, strategies to mitigate limitations, and novel peer-evaluation approach. The benchmark seems more robust and less prone to limitations than many existing options.

- One area where more research may be needed is in detecting and mitigating potential biases or limitations of the LM examiners themselves. But overall, this paper introduces useful innovations that advance the sophistication of benchmarking techniques for foundation models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different prompt design strategies for the examiner model to generate high-quality and diverse questions across knowledge domains. The authors mention this could help create more comprehensive benchmark datasets.

- Developing more advanced natural language generation evaluation capabilities in foundation models to facilitate large-scale peer-examination with many examiner models. The authors note current limitations in the number of models that can reliably conduct evaluations. 

- Leveraging the proposed frameworks to create benchmarks spanning diverse tasks beyond question answering, such as summarization, translation, and dialogue.

- Analyzing and mitigating potential biases in examiner models during question generation and evaluation. The authors recognize examiner bias as an issue to be further explored.

- Incorporating conversational context and history into the multi-round question-asking process to engage in more natural dialogue evaluations.

- Evaluating how well current foundation models acquire and localize knowledge compared to humans through behavioral testing paradigms.

- Exploring metrics beyond scoring and ranking for open-ended language generation tasks that offer more nuanced performance measurement.

In summary, the authors recommend research directions focused on prompt engineering, model scaling, mitigating bias, expanding task coverage, conversational QA, human evaluation comparisons, and novel evaluation metrics. Advancing these areas could further improve benchmarking processes for foundation models.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, where language models are utilized as knowledgeable examiners to generate questions that test the capabilities of other language models. The examiner model poses questions across diverse domains and evaluates the responses from other models in a reference-free manner, assigning scores based on accuracy, coherence, factuality and comprehensiveness. To ensure a comprehensive assessment, the examiner generates follow-up questions on correctly answered topics to probe deeper understanding.

The benchmark is tested on several popular foundation models and demonstrates its effectiveness in evaluating knowledge breadth and depth in an automated manner while also balancing fairness across examiners.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem/question it is addressing is:

How to develop a more comprehensive, unbiased, and scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate foundation models on open-ended question answering. 

The paper identifies two main issues with existing benchmarking pipelines for assessing foundation models:

1) Testing leakage - As models are pretrained on increasing amounts of data, they may have already seen the answers to test questions, leading to overestimated performance.

2) Evaluation automation - Evaluating freeform textual responses is challenging to automate, so benchmarks often use multiple choice instead of open-ended questions. But this differs from real usage.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new benchmarking framework called Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, which uses the language model itself to generate diverse questions across domains based on its knowledge, and evaluate responses in a reference-free manner. 

The paper also proposes strategies like multi-round follow-up questions, scoring/ranking metrics, and a decentralized peer-examination mechanism to provide more comprehensive and fair assessments.

In summary, the key problem is developing an improved benchmarking methodology to more effectively evaluate foundation models on open-ended QA in a scalable, comprehensive and unbiased manner. The proposed Language-Model-as-an-Examiner framework aims to address the limitations of existing benchmarking approaches.
