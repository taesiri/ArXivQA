# [Cartoon Explanations of Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03485)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key points are:

- The paper introduces a new model-agnostic explanation method called CartoonX that is tailored for explaining image classifiers. 

- CartoonX is built on the rate-distortion explanation (RDE) framework but applies it in the wavelet domain rather than the pixel domain. The goal is to extract the "relevant piecewise smooth part" of an image instead of just the pixel-sparse relevant regions.

- CartoonX uses the sparsity of wavelet representations for cartoon-like/piecewise smooth images. By enforcing sparsity in the wavelet domain, the extracted explanations become piecewise smooth instead of pixel-sparse and jittery.

- The authors reformulate and generalize the RDE framework to allow applying it to different input representations beyond just pixels. This allows answering more complex interpretation queries like extracting the piecewise smooth parts relevant for a classifier.

- Through experiments on ImageNet, the authors demonstrate CartoonX can reveal new explanatory insights compared to pixel-based methods, particularly for misclassifications. They also show CartoonX achieves lower distortion with fewer coefficients.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that operating in the wavelet domain and extracting piecewise smooth explanations will provide more insightful and efficient explanations for image classifiers compared to existing pixel-based methods. CartoonX is presented as a concrete instantiation of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Reformulation and reinterpretation of the rate-distortion explanation (RDE) framework to allow more flexible input representations and accommodate different interpretation queries. 

2. Introduction of CartoonX, a new model-agnostic explanation method tailored for image classifiers. CartoonX applies RDE in the wavelet domain to extract the relevant piecewise smooth parts of an image, rather than just pixel-sparse regions like previous methods.

3. Demonstration that CartoonX can provide novel explanatory insights, especially for misclassifications, by revealing relevant patterns not visible with pixel-based methods.

4. Quantitative analysis showing CartoonX achieves lower distortion with fewer coefficients compared to other state-of-the-art explanation methods.

In summary, the key innovations seem to be reformulating RDE to allow explanations in transformed domains like wavelets, and using this to develop CartoonX which produces smoother, piecewise explanations for image classifiers. The experiments highlight the benefits of CartoonX over pixel-based methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents CartoonX, a new model-agnostic explanation method for image classifiers that extracts the relevant piecewise smooth parts of an image by requiring sparsity in the wavelet domain rather than pixel space, enabling it to reveal explanatory information not visible with existing pixel-based methods and achieve lower distortion with fewer coefficients.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract, introduction, and related work section, here is a summary of how this work compares to other research in explainable AI (XAI) for image classifiers:

Main similarities:

- Like many other XAI methods, this paper proposes generating visual explanations in the form of heatmaps or salient masks to explain the predictions of image classifiers. 

- It is based on the Rate-Distortion Explanation (RDE) framework, an existing model-agnostic XAI method, and extends it to operate on wavelet representations of images rather than raw pixels.

- Evaluates the method on ImageNet classifiers to show it can identify visually interpretable patterns that are relevant for the model's predictions, consistent with goals of other visualization-based XAI techniques.

Key differences:

- Uniquely represents images in the wavelet domain and generates explanations by optimizing for sparsity in this domain rather than on raw pixels. This allows the method to extract "piecewise smooth" explanations.

- First XAI method for images to leverage wavelet sparsity to produce cartoon-like simplified explanations, taking advantage of the fact that natural images are approximately piecewise smooth.

- Emphasizes generating simplified explanations that adhere to human prior knowledge about the domain (images are approximately "cartoon-like"), unlike methods that focus only on optimizing pixel-level faithfulness to the model.

- Claims to reveal novel explanatory insights compared to pixel-based methods, especially for misclassifications, by extracting interpretable piecewise smooth patterns.

- Quantitatively evaluates the method by showing it achieves lower distortion with fewer wavelet coefficients, demonstrating benefits of the wavelet domain optimization.

In summary, this work introduces a novel approach of performing XAI for images in the wavelet domain to generate simplified cartoon-like explanations that are argued to be more intuitive and revealing of model logic. The wavelet-based optimization and the notion of extracting interpretable "piecewise smooth parts" of images seems unique among current XAI techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the runtime of CartoonX to make it more practical for real-time applications. The authors acknowledge that CartoonX is computationally expensive compared to other perturbation-based methods. They suggest exploring ways to speed it up, such as by learning an initial wavelet mask or the full wavelet mask with a neural network.

- Studying the use of inpainting GANs for the perturbation/obfuscation strategy in CartoonX. The authors currently use a simple Gaussian noise approach but suggest inpainting GANs could help generate more realistic perturbations while staying on the data manifold. However, potential biases in the GAN would need to be studied.

- Applying the generalized RDE framework to create explanation methods tailored to other data domains besides images. The authors reformulated RDE to be more flexible and suggest it can provide a blueprint for developing domain-specific explanation methods, where the key is choosing a representation system that sparsely represents the desired class of explanations.

- Exploring combinations of CartoonX with other methods like saliency maps to further improve explanations. The authors view CartoonX as a valuable new tool that could complement other methods.

- Conducting user studies to better evaluate the interpretability of CartoonX explanations compared to other methods from a human perspective. The authors provide some qualitative examples but more rigorous human evaluation could be beneficial.

- Extending CartoonX to other model types besides differentiable image classifiers, such as black-box models where gradient access is not available. The RDE framework does not fundamentally require gradients but the authors' current CartoonX implementation does.

In summary, the key suggestions are around improving CartoonX itself, applying RDE to new domains, combining CartoonX with other methods, and conducting more rigorous human evaluation. The authors view CartoonX as a source of inspiration for developing tailored explanation methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents CartoonX, a new model-agnostic explanation method for image classifiers based on the rate-distortion explanation (RDE) framework. The key idea is to explain an image classification by extracting the relevant "piece-wise smooth" part of the image, rather than just highlighting relevant pixels. This is achieved by reformulating RDE to operate in the wavelet domain, where sparsity corresponds to piece-wise smooth images. CartoonX optimizes an RDE mask on the wavelet coefficients of an image to minimize distortion in the classifier output. The final mask is visualized as a simplified cartoon-like image highlighting the features most relevant for the classification. Experiments on ImageNet classifiers show CartoonX reveals interpretable patterns, especially for misclassifications, and achieves better rate-distortion performance than pixel-based methods. Overall, CartoonX demonstrates the value of explaining images based on piece-wise smoothness rather than pixel sparsity.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents CartoonX, a new model-agnostic explanation method tailored for image classifiers. CartoonX is based on the rate-distortion explanation (RDE) framework, but reformulates RDE to allow explanations in different input representations besides pixels. CartoonX applies RDE in the wavelet domain, requiring the explanation to be sparse in wavelet coefficients rather than pixels. This extracts the relevant piecewise smooth parts of an image, producing cartoon-like explanations. 

The authors demonstrate qualitatively that the cartoon explanations from CartoonX can provide novel insights, especially for misclassifications, by exposing patterns not visible in pixel-space methods. Quantitatively, CartoonX achieves lower distortion with fewer coefficients compared to pixel-based RDE and other methods. The cartoon explanations also appear more interpretable. However, CartoonX has limitations including slower runtimes than gradient methods and difficulty explaining regions without edges. Overall, CartoonX provides a new approach for image explanation by using wavelets, but further work is needed to address its limitations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new explanation method called CartoonX that is tailored for explaining image classifiers. CartoonX is based on the rate-distortion explanation (RDE) framework and operates in the wavelet domain instead of pixel space. Specifically, CartoonX optimizes a deletion mask over the wavelet coefficients of an image to minimize the distortion in the classifier output while remaining sparse. Sparsity in the wavelet domain results in extracting the relevant piecewise smooth regions of the image. CartoonX then visualizes the wavelet mask as a simplified cartoon-like image by inverting it back to the pixel domain. This produces an explanation highlighting the key smooth patterns in the image that retain the classifier's decision. Unlike other methods explaining in pixel space, CartoonX produces non-jittery and naturally simplified explanations by exploiting sparsity in the wavelet domain.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main points are:

- The paper presents a new method called CartoonX for explaining image classification decisions. 

- CartoonX is based on the rate-distortion explanation (RDE) framework, but applies it in the wavelet domain rather than pixel space. 

- The goal is to extract the "relevant piecewise smooth part" of an image that leads to a model's classification decision. This is in contrast to other methods that highlight pixel-sparse regions.

- CartoonX is motivated by the idea that natural images are "cartoon-like", meaning they are roughly piecewise smooth and sparse in the wavelet domain. So sparsity in wavelets corresponds to piecewise smoothness.

- The paper argues CartoonX explanations are more interpretable for image classifiers than other methods, since they extract simplified cartoon-versions rather than pixel-sparse heatmaps.

- Experiments show CartoonX can reveal patterns for misclassifications not easily visible in other methods. It also achieves lower distortion with fewer coefficients compared to pixel-based RDE and other methods.

In summary, the key focus is presenting CartoonX as a novel model-agnostic explanation method tailored for image classifiers, which provides an alternative approach to explaining in the wavelet rather than pixel domain. The goal is generating more interpretable cartoon-like explanations.
