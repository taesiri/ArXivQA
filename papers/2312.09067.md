## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Holodeck, a system for generating diverse, customized, and interactive 3D environments for Embodied AI based on textual descriptions. Holodeck is built on top of AI2-THOR and leverages a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse. It utilizes the common sense knowledge and spatial reasoning abilities of large language models like GPT-4 to interpret natural language prompts and automatically construct complete 3D scenes. The system has specialized modules that design floorplans, select appropriate objects, materials, doors/windows, and optimize object layouts via spatial relational constraints. Comprehensive human evaluations demonstrate that Holodeck surpasses procedural generation methods on residential scenes and achieves satisfactory performance on various indoor scene types. The application of Holodeck to embodied AI is shown through experiments on zero-shot object navigation, where agents trained on Holodeck scenes adapt much better to novel environments designed by human experts. Key strengths of the system include language-based control, asset diversity, spatial reasoning, style/layout customizability, and the fully automated creation of interactive embodied AI scenes.
