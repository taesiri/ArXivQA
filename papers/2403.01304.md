# [Improving the Validity of Automatically Generated Feedback via   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Providing helpful feedback to students is critical for learning, but manually generating high-quality feedback is difficult and expensive. 
- Feedback needs to be correct, identify student mistakes, provide useful suggestions, and encourage students.
- Automatically evaluating generated feedback is also challenging. Metrics based on text overlap are unreliable and human evaluation is costly.

Solution:
- Propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback on 5 aspects: correctness, not revealing the answer, giving suggestions, identifying the mistake, and positive tone.
- Use GPT-4 to evaluate feedback with the rubric. Show it has high agreement with humans.
- Construct an augmented dataset with human feedback and flawed LLM-generated feedback.
- Fine-tune Llama 2 to generate better feedback via reinforcement learning, using GPT-4's rubric evaluations as the reward signal. 
- Train with direct preference optimization on pairs of feedbacks to align with human preferences.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate that GPT-4 can accurately evaluate feedback for correctness and alignment with educational goals.
- Show that data augmentation and preference-based fine-tuning significantly improves Llama 2's feedback generation over baselines.
- Approach the performance of GPT-4 and human teachers on key metrics using the much smaller Llama 2 model.
- Provide analysis of GPT-4's weaknesses in evaluating feedback to guide future work.
- Propose a general framework for generating and evaluating feedback that could extend to other subjects.

The core insight is that leveraging human and LLM judgments to create an augmented dataset for preference-based fine-tuning allows improving feedback quality from smaller models. The work also analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of using GPT-4 for automated evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for generating high-quality, pedagogically-aligned feedback for students' incorrect answers to math questions, using data augmentation, preference learning with reinforcement learning, and rubric-based evaluation with GPT-4.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a rubric for evaluating generated feedback in math education along multiple dimensions including correctness, alignment with educational goals, etc. 

2) Showing that large language models like GPT-4 can effectively evaluate feedback using this rubric, with high agreement to human evaluations.

3) Presenting a framework for generating high-quality feedback using reinforcement learning, where the reward is based on evaluations from the proposed rubric. Specifically, they use direct preference optimization (DPO) to align an LLM generator (Llama 2) with human preferences.

4) Demonstrating through experiments that their approach significantly improves the quality of automatically generated feedback from Llama 2 in both correctness and alignment with educational goals. Their best method approaches the performance of GPT-4 using a much smaller model.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an end-to-end framework for generating pedagogically helpful feedback in math education using rubric-based evaluation and preference learning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using reinforcement learning, specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to improve the quality of automatically generated feedback. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of using DPO compared to other RL algorithms like PPO for this task?

2. The paper constructs hard negative examples for training using mismatched human-written feedback from different incorrect answers to the same question. Why are these useful as hard negatives? What other potential sources of hard negatives could be leveraged?  

3. The rubric used for evaluating feedback quality includes 5 criteria - correctness, not revealing the answer, giving suggestions, identifying the error, and positive tone. Do you think any key aspects of quality feedback are missing from this rubric? What would you add or change?

4. The authors find that fine-tuning via standard supervised learning does not improve feedback quality over the zero-shot baseline. What are some reasons this could be the case? How could the fine-tuning setup be improved?

5. For feedback evaluation, GPT-4 is used instead of human annotators to reduce cost. However, several failure cases of GPT-4 are discussed. How feasible do you think it is to address issues like mathematical reasoning errors using additional prompt engineering? 

6. The authors qualitatively analyze cases where the LLMs fail to generate valid feedback, finding that a key issue is incorrectly identifying student errors, especially when multiple steps are required. How might the LLMs' reasoning process be augmented to better identify chains of logic leading to errors?

7. Could the proposed data augmentation and training framework generalize well to non-MCQ problems where there is no predefined set of common incorrect answers? What changes would need to be made?

8. The paper focuses on math education, but discusses potential generalization to other subjects like programming. What key differences exist in giving programming feedback compared to math? Would significant changes to the method be required?

9. The paper uses scores from GPT-4's rubric-based annotations to create preferences for DPO training. Could this method of automated preference creation generalize well to other text generation tasks beyond just feedback?

10. How suitable do you think the proposed method would be for deployment in a real-world online learning platform? What practical concerns around model performance, cost, or ethical issues may need to be addressed?
