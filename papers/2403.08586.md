# [PRAGO: Differentiable Multi-View Pose Optimization From Objectness   Detections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Estimating accurate absolute camera poses from a set of unordered images is a fundamental but challenging task, especially for small-scale scenes with few images and wide baselines between views. Most structure-from-motion (SfM) methods rely on an initial robust estimate of absolute poses, but struggle on such sparse data. 

Proposed Solution - PRAGO:
The paper proposes a novel differentiable pipeline called PRAGO (Pose-refined Rotation Averaging Graph Optimization) to estimate absolute camera poses by leveraging objectness detections. The key ideas are:

1) Refine noisy pairwise relative poses using objectness detections, focusing on correcting orientation errors and chirality issues. This resolves ambiguities without removing edges.

2) Iteratively construct a pose graph, reweight the refined relative rotations, and optimize them to estimate absolute rotations via differentiable rotation averaging.  

3) Combine refined translations and optimized absolute rotations through differentiable translation averaging to get full absolute poses.

The pose refinement, rotation averaging and translation averaging modules are integrated into one end-to-end differentiable network that is trained jointly.

Main Contributions:

- Propose PRAGO, a novel differentiable pipeline for camera pose estimation that leverages objectness detections to handle small, sparse sets of images effectively.

- Design an objectness-based pose refinement approach that resolves ambiguity and chirality issues in relative poses without removing edges from the graph.

- Integrate iterative rotation averaging blocks that reweight and optimize a pose graph to estimate absolute rotations.

- Demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, with a 21% improvement in rotation accuracy on the 7-Scenes dataset. 

- Provide analysis showing pose refinement corrects chirality issues in relative poses, improving downstream rotation averaging performance.

Overall, the paper addresses camera pose estimation for difficult small-scale sparse scenarios by proposing an end-to-end differentiable pipeline, outperforming prior concatenated systems. A core insight is leveraging objectness detections to resolve ambiguity and chirality issues when refining relative poses.
