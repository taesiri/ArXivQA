# [CARLA-Autoware-Bridge: Facilitating Autonomous Driving Research with a   Unified Framework for Simulation and Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Testing and validating autonomous vehicle (AV) software modules in isolation is not sufficient to ensure safety. System-level testing using high-fidelity (HF) simulation is needed but there is currently no framework enabling closed-loop testing of a state-of-the-art modular AV software stack like Autoware Core/Universe with a rich simulation environment like CARLA. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a bridge connecting CARLA and Autoware to enable system-level testing. The bridge handles efficient bidirectional data flow - sensor data from simulation to AV software and control commands in reverse. It builds on the existing CARLA-ROS bridge.

- Compatible vehicle model, sensor configuration and map are created for CARLA and Autoware. The bridge converts between coordinate systems and data formats. 

- A PID controller is implemented to convert Autoware's Ackermann control commands to CARLA's throttle, brake and steering angle inputs.

Main Contributions:
- An open-source CARLA-Autoware bridge enabling closed-loop system-level testing of Autoware using CARLA's HF simulation and environment models.

- Performance analysis showing the bridge adds minimal latency (<15ms on average) even with large sensor configurations, though latency increases significantly for >500k LiDAR points/sec.

- Framework facilitates testing and development of Autoware modules in realistic scenarios; can be expanded with additional environments, sensors and vehicle dynamics models.

In summary, the paper presents a novel bridge allowing Autoware testing using CARLA for HF system-level validation critical for ensuring AV safety. The open-source bridge with benchmark results constitutes the main contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework that links the CARLA autonomous driving simulator with the Autoware automated vehicle software stack to enable closed-loop testing of Autoware at the system level using CARLA's assets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is developing a framework that enables system-level testing of the modular autonomous driving software Autoware Core/Universe using the CARLA driving simulator. Specifically, the authors:

1) Developed a CARLA-Autoware-Bridge to facilitate communication between CARLA and Autoware, enabling closed-loop testing.

2) Enhanced the existing ROS-Bridge for CARLA to efficiently handle sensor data flow between the simulator and Autoware. 

3) Created compatible assets like a sensor kit, vehicle model, and HD map to integrate Autoware with CARLA.

4) Analyzed the performance of the framework in terms of latency and CPU utilization under different sensor configurations to demonstrate its efficiency. 

In summary, the paper presents an open-source testing framework that allows researchers to evaluate Autoware modules at a system level within realistic driving scenarios simulated in CARLA. This enables more extensive testing to ensure safety and performance of autonomous driving systems.
