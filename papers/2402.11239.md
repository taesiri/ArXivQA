# [CARLA-Autoware-Bridge: Facilitating Autonomous Driving Research with a   Unified Framework for Simulation and Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Testing and validating autonomous vehicle (AV) software modules in isolation is not sufficient to ensure safety. System-level testing using high-fidelity (HF) simulation is needed but there is currently no framework enabling closed-loop testing of a state-of-the-art modular AV software stack like Autoware Core/Universe with a rich simulation environment like CARLA. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a bridge connecting CARLA and Autoware to enable system-level testing. The bridge handles efficient bidirectional data flow - sensor data from simulation to AV software and control commands in reverse. It builds on the existing CARLA-ROS bridge.

- Compatible vehicle model, sensor configuration and map are created for CARLA and Autoware. The bridge converts between coordinate systems and data formats. 

- A PID controller is implemented to convert Autoware's Ackermann control commands to CARLA's throttle, brake and steering angle inputs.

Main Contributions:
- An open-source CARLA-Autoware bridge enabling closed-loop system-level testing of Autoware using CARLA's HF simulation and environment models.

- Performance analysis showing the bridge adds minimal latency (<15ms on average) even with large sensor configurations, though latency increases significantly for >500k LiDAR points/sec.

- Framework facilitates testing and development of Autoware modules in realistic scenarios; can be expanded with additional environments, sensors and vehicle dynamics models.

In summary, the paper presents a novel bridge allowing Autoware testing using CARLA for HF system-level validation critical for ensuring AV safety. The open-source bridge with benchmark results constitutes the main contributions.
