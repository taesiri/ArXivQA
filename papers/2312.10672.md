# [Automatic Optimisation of Normalised Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks with layerwise parameter normalization are useful for control applications since normalization bounds the Lipschitz constant and improves stability. 
- However, standard gradient descent methods are inconsistent with the geometry of normalized parameters, which lie on spheres. 
- Prior Riemannian optimization methods are expensive and have not seen widespread adoption. Manually tuning learning rates for normalized networks is also difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two automated optimization methods tailored for layerwise normalized neural networks:
   1. Hessian-Free Automatic Differentiation (AD) method: Determines step size by minimizing a 2nd order Taylor approximation of the loss along the update direction.
   2. Majorization-Minimization (MM) method: Constructs an upper bound on the loss and minimizes this majorant to determine step size.

- Both methods explicitly account for the spherical geometry by parameterizing the update as motion along a great circle.

- The AD method uses automatic differentiation to compute the 2nd order directional derivative to determine optimal step size. No manual tuning or learning rate scheduling is needed.

- The MM method constructs a conservative analytic upper bound on the loss. Minimizing this majorant gives the step size.

Contributions:
- Provides a principled initialization and update procedure for normalized networks.
- New optimization methods that automatically adapt step size while respecting spherical geometry.
- Experiments show rapid initial convergence and consistent performance across architectures.
- Hessian-free AD method gave fastest convergence, achieving under 1N RMS error with only 200 iterations.
- Methods enable automated training of normalized networks without manual tuning.

In summary, the paper introduces optimization techniques tailored for normalized neural networks that automatically determine step size while accounting for the non-Euclidean parameter geometry. The methods enable stable automated training without costly Hessian computations or manual tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent and rapid convergence across tasks and architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes automatic optimization methods for layerwise-normalized neural networks by determining the step size along update curves on spheres using either automatic differentiation of the directional derivative or majorization-minimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing automatic optimisation methods for neural networks with layerwise parameter normalisation. Specifically, the paper presents two methods to automatically determine the step size at each iteration for gradient descent on manifolds:

1) A Hessian-free method using automatic differentiation to compute second-order directional derivatives along the update direction and minimize a quadratic approximation. 

2) A majorization-minimization method that derives an analytical upper bound on the perturbation to construct a majorant function, which is then minimized over step size.

The key benefit is that these methods avoid manual tuning of learning rates for normalized neural networks. Experiments demonstrate rapid initial convergence and consistent performance across different network architectures with the automatic differentiation-based method. Thus, the main contribution is developing principled algorithms to automate hyperparameter tuning for this class of normalised networks.

The paper proposes automatic optimisation methods for deep neural networks with layerwise normalisation of parameters with respect to the Frobenius norm. It utilizes concepts like the exponential map on matrix manifolds and Riemannian gradient descent to account for the geometry of the parameter space. Key techniques include a Hessian-free method using automatic differentiation and a majorisation-minimisation framework to automatically determine stepsizes. The goal is to bound the Lipschitz constant and avoid manual tuning of learning rates. The methods aim to improve on prior techniques like spectral normalisation and architecture-aware optimisation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two different methods (AD-based and MM-based) for automatically determining the step size when optimizing normalized neural networks. What are the key differences in how these two methods determine the step size and what are the relative advantages/disadvantages of each?

2. Assumption 1 plays a key role in deriving the majorization used by the MM method. Explain this assumption in more detail and discuss whether it is reasonable. How might violating this assumption impact the performance of the MM method?  

3. The AD method utilizes second order directional derivative information to determine the step size while avoiding explicit Hessian constructions. Explain how this directional derivative information is obtained and why it allows an appropriate step size to be selected.

4. Both proposed methods update the neural network parameters based on a carefully constructed update curve on the manifold of layerwise weight matrices. Explain the geometry behind this update curve and why updating in this manner is beneficial compared to standard gradient descent. 

5. The performance of the two proposed methods, especially convergence speed, differed significantly in the experiments. Analyze the experimental results and discuss potential reasons behind these differences. Are they fundamental differences or can tweaks to the methods resolve them?

6. How exactly does the data preprocessing performed in the spectral initialization procedure ensure that the neural network's gain is properly matched to the data? Why is this important?

7. The MM method requires finding a majorization of the loss function through bounding the perturbation terms. Derive this bounding process in detail and explain how the majorant is constructed. What flexibility is there in terms of the majorant selected?

8. Both methods require projecting the gradient onto the tangent space of the weight spheres at each layer. Explain the geometry behind this projection and why it is necessary when optimizing on manifolds.

9. The experiments showed improved performance on smaller normalized networks. Analyze why normalizing the network in this layerwise manner might have greater benefits for smaller networks. 

10. The proposed methods eliminate the need to manually tune learning rates for normalized networks. Discuss how the methods might be extended to automatically adapt other key hyperparameters like network width and depth.
