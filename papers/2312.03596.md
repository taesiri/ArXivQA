# [MMM: Generative Masked Motion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03596)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MMM, a novel generative masked motion model for text-driven human motion generation. MMM consists of a motion tokenizer that transforms raw 3D motions into discrete latent space tokens, and a conditional masked transformer that predicts randomly masked motion tokens based on text descriptors. During parallel decoding, multiple motion tokens are predicted concurrently per iteration, enabling fast and high-fidelity motion generation. MMM also enables innate motion editing capabilities such as motion in-betweening, upper body part modification, and long sequence generation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM exceeds current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality evidenced by a top FID score of 0.08, while being over 100 times faster than comparable editable diffusion models. The efficiency, high fidelity and editability offered by MMM establishes a new state-of-the-art for real-time text-driven motion generation and editing.
