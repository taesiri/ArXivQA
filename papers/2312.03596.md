# [MMM: Generative Masked Motion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03596)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MMM, a novel generative masked motion model for text-driven human motion generation. MMM consists of a motion tokenizer that transforms raw 3D motions into discrete latent space tokens, and a conditional masked transformer that predicts randomly masked motion tokens based on text descriptors. During parallel decoding, multiple motion tokens are predicted concurrently per iteration, enabling fast and high-fidelity motion generation. MMM also enables innate motion editing capabilities such as motion in-betweening, upper body part modification, and long sequence generation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM exceeds current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality evidenced by a top FID score of 0.08, while being over 100 times faster than comparable editable diffusion models. The efficiency, high fidelity and editability offered by MMM establishes a new state-of-the-art for real-time text-driven motion generation and editing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MMM, a novel masked motion model for fast, high-fidelity, and editable text-to-motion generation, which transforms motion data into discrete tokens and uses a conditional masked transformer to predict randomly masked tokens based on text embeddings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing MMM, a novel motion generation paradigm based on conditional Masked Motion Modeling. MMM consists of:

1) A motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into discrete tokens in latent space. 

2) A conditional masked motion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens, conditioned on the text tokens. 

The key benefits of MMM highlighted in the paper are:

- It enables high-fidelity and high-speed text-driven motion generation via parallel decoding of multiple motion tokens simultaneously. 

- It has innate motion editability by simply placing mask tokens where editing is needed. This supports tasks like motion in-betweening, upper body part editing, and long sequence generation.

- Experiments show it surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in motion generation quality and speed, while preserving advanced editing capabilities.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the MMM approach for high-quality, fast, and editable text-to-motion generation.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing text-to-motion generation models suffer from a trade-off between speed, quality, and editability. Specifically, diffusion and autoregressive models achieve high quality but are very slow. Latent space alignment methods are faster but produce lower quality motions. None of the existing methods offer both high speed and quality while preserving editability.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes the Generative Masked Motion Model (MMM) which consists of two key components:

1) Motion tokenizer: Transforms motion sequences into discrete tokens using vector quantization into a learned latent space codebook. This preserves fine-grained motion details while compressing the motion.

2) Conditional masked transformer: Predicts randomly masked motion tokens in parallel based on unmasked tokens and text embeddings from CLIP. Attends to all tokens bidirectionally to model dependencies.

During inference, MMM performs iterative parallel decoding where it predicts multiple low-confidence tokens simultaneously to generate the full motion.

Main Contributions:

- MMM achieves state-of-the-art motion quality surpassing current methods as evidenced by FID scores of 0.08 on HumanML3D and 0.429 on KIT-ML datasets.

- Two orders of magnitude faster inference than diffusion models, and 2x faster than autoregressive models. 

- Enables seamless motion editing capabilities such as body-part modifications, in-betweening, outpainting and long sequence generation.

- Simple yet effective masked modeling paradigm departing from predominant diffusion and autoregressive approaches for text-to-motion generation.

In summary, MMM pushes the state-of-the-art in text-to-motion generation by simultaneously achieving high speed, quality and editability, which has not been possible with prior works. The masked modeling paradigm offers a promising new direction for text-conditioned generative modeling.
