# [Monotonic Differentiable Sorting Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09630v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we design differentiable sorting algorithms that produce monotonic outputs and have bounded approximation errors?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Using certain families of sigmoid functions to parameterize the continuous relaxations of sorting networks will result in monotonicity and bounded errors.2) Monotonicity and bounded errors are desirable properties for differentiable sorting algorithms used in neural network training. Monotonicity ensures gradients have the correct sign, while bounded errors prevent the outputs from diverging too much from true sorted outputs.3) Differentiable sorting algorithms with these properties will outperform previous differentiable sorting methods without monotonicity guarantees on tasks like predicting values from images based only on rank supervision.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that enforcing monotonicity and bounded errors in differentiable sorting networks will improve performance on tasks involving ordering/ranking supervision, which the authors test empirically. The theoretical contribution is identifying conditions on the sigmoid functions that guarantee these properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel relaxation of conditional swap operations in sorting networks to guarantee monotonicity. Specifically:- They introduce a family of sigmoid functions and prove these produce differentiable sorting networks that are monotonic. Monotonicity ensures the gradients always have the correct sign, which is useful for gradient-based optimization.- They show the cumulative density function (CDF) of the Cauchy distribution and a function that minimizes the error bound produce monotonic conditional swaps.- They empirically demonstrate on the MNIST and SVHN sorting tasks that making the sorting function monotonic improves performance over previous non-monotonic relaxations.In summary, the key contribution is introducing and analyzing monotonic continuous relaxations of conditional swap operations in differentiable sorting networks. This makes the sorting function quasiconvex and results in improved performance on sorting supervision tasks.
