# [Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models against Common Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11943)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper identifies a gap in the evaluation of large multimodal models (LMMs) - specifically the lack of tools to measure the consistency of their outputs when subjected to common input corruptions across modalities. This is an important capability for practical deployment and understanding model reliability.

Proposed Solution 
The paper proposes a new benchmark, MMCBench, to evaluate the self-consistency of over 150 checkpoints from more than 100 popular LMMs under common corruptions. It focuses on cross-modal interactions between text, image and speech across four key generation tasks: text-to-image, image-to-text, text-to-speech and speech-to-text.

MMCBench applies 23 text corruptions, 29 image corruptions and 16 speech corruptions at different intensities to carefully selected inputs that are inherently challenging. It then measures the similarity between outputs from clean vs corrupted inputs, and between outputs from the same corrupted inputs, using cross-modality metrics where feasible.

Key Contributions
- Creation of a comprehensive benchmark covering over 150 checkpoints of 100+ LMMs for evaluating self-consistency under common corruptions
- Investigation of cross-modal interactions between text, image and speech across four key generation tasks
- Introduction of a rigorous data selection methodology to identify challenging input examples likely to expose consistency issues
- Use of both cross-modality and uni-modality similarity metrics to quantify output consistency 
- Analysis providing insights into the relative resilience of various models, and the impact of factors like LLM size/architecture

The benchmark aims to plug a key gap in understanding LMM reliability and facilitates better model development through its publicly available code and detailed analyses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MMCBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the consistency of over 150 large multimodal model checkpoints across 4 key generative tasks when subjected to common corruptions of input text, images, and speech.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new benchmark, named MMCBench, for evaluating the robustness and self-consistency of large multimodal models (LMMs) when subjected to common corruptions across modalities. Specifically:

- MMCBench focuses on evaluating consistency in the cross-modal interactions between text, image, and speech, across four key generation tasks: text-to-image, image-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. 

- It covers over 100 popular LMMs with over 150 model checkpoints, making it a comprehensive benchmark.

- MMCBench tests the models against 23 text corruptions, 29 image corruptions, and 16 speech corruptions to thoroughly evaluate their robustness.

- It introduces quantitative metrics to measure the self-consistency of models' outputs when inputs are corrupted. Both cross-modality consistency and output-only modality consistency scores are reported.

- The benchmark and analysis provide insights into the reliability and real-world efficacy of cutting-edge LMMs when facing noisy or adversarial inputs.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and release of MMCBench, which is positioned to fill an important gap in the assessment and understanding of large multimodal models through extensive corruption analysis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the motivation behind developing the MMCBench benchmark specifically focused on evaluating consistency under common input corruptions? How does it fill a gap compared to existing multimodal evaluation benchmarks?

2. Why was text chosen as the semantic anchor for data selection across modalities? What are the potential limitations of using text similarity for determining data complexity and diversity? 

3. The paper mentions determining caption quality and complexity using metrics like readability, syntax complexity, description richness etc. during the text-to-image data selection process. Could you expand more on how these metrics were calculated or implemented?

4. For image-to-text, image quality and inherent challenge were criteria for data selection. What specific metrics or models were used to quantify image quality and expected difficulty for caption generation models? 

5. For text-to-speech data selection, both linguistic and acoustic complexity were considered. Could you elaborate on how acoustic complexity was evaluated to pick challenging speech samples?

6. Why was cross-modality similarity evaluation between speech and text difficult compared to image and text? What improvements can be made to better assess speech-text consistency in future work?

7. The benchmark results currently seem to focus more on greedy decoding. How significantly could the consistency results change if sampling or beam search decoding was used instead for text generation?

8. Apart from selection criteria and corruption methods, what other analysis dimensions could be included in future iterations of MMCBench to expand multimodal robustness testing?

9. The current modality coverage is focused on text, image and speech. What would be some challenges in incorporating video modality for corruption and consistency testing?

10. A high output consistency score could also imply model hallucination or failure modes not changing significantly under corruption. How can the benchmark be enhanced to detect such deception cases?
