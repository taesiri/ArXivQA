## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "TEXiterity - Tactile Extrinsic deXterity: Simultaneous Tactile Estimation and Control for Extrinsic Dexterity":

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of precisely controlling in-hand manipulation and regrasping of objects by pushing against the environment (extrinsic dexterity). This capability is useful for improving grasp stability, enabling tactile exploration, establishing grasps suitable for downstream tasks like insertion or tool use, and preventing collisions or kinematic singularities. However, in-hand manipulation is difficult due to the need to accurately estimate object pose under occlusion and to model complex contact dynamics when sequencing contact modes.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a simultaneous tactile estimator-controller that integrates measurements from robot proprioception and a high-resolution tactile sensor to simultaneously estimate and control the pose of grasped objects. The framework consists of two main components:

1) A discrete pose estimator that tracks the most likely sequence of poses in a coarsely discretized grid by fusing streams of tactile images and incorporating knowledge of the environment layout.

2) A continuous pose estimator-controller that refines the pose estimate and generates motion plans to accurately manipulate the object's pose in a receding horizon fashion using factor graphs, while considering kinematic constraints, physics models, and control objectives.

The discrete and continuous components work together to provide both a global understanding of the general object pose and fine-grained control of the precise object pose to accomplish user-specified goal configurations.

Main Contributions:

- A method that combines tactile perception and control to achieve precise in-hand manipulation, overcoming limitations of prior work that considered these problems in isolation.  

- Demonstrated precise control of diverse user-specified goal configurations related to adjusting grasp pose, object orientation, and extrinsic sliding.

- Generalization to real household objects in realistic scenarios without needing highly accurate contact models.

- Promising results in high-tolerance insertion tasks that require precise pose control prior to mating parts.

Overall, the work provides a complete pipeline for closed-loop extrinsic dexterity, laying the algorithmic foundations for precise manipulation skills under occlusion and limited intrinsic dexterity. The approach could enable autonomous regrasping and reorientation for applications in areas like assembly, tool use, and assistive robotics.
