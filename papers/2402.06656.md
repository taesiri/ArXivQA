## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the key challenge of data scarcity in stock forecasting tasks, characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data homogeneity. These issues of limited data availability and quality pose significant obstacles to developing accurate stock forecasting models.  

Proposed Solution - DiffsFormer:
The paper proposes DiffsFormer, a novel conditional diffusion transformer framework to generate additional stock factors to augment training procedures. Key aspects include:

- Leverages diffusion models (DMs) and transfer learning to distill knowledge from a larger source domain when augmenting a target domain. 

- Employs an editing step rather than full generation to ensure fidelity of augmented factors to the target distribution. The editing step controls extent of knowledge distillation.

- Incorporates conditional guidance mechanisms using labels and industry sectors to relate augmented factors to corresponding outputs. This adapts DMs from generative to supervised learning tasks.

- Additional optimizations like loss-guided noise injection and time efficiency improvements.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates efficacy of artificial intelligence generated sample augmentation to address data scarcity issues in stock forecasting.

- Introduces DiffsFormer architecture incorporating diffusion models and transformers for controlled and conditional stock factor editing.

- Extensive experiments over multiple models and datasets indicate significant performance gains from DiffsFormer augmented training, with 7.2% and 27.8% relative return ratio improvements. 

- Analysis provides insights into working of DiffsFormer, how transfer learning distills knowledge, and how conditional guidance and editing step enhance accuracy.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in leveraging AI for data augmentation to tackle challenges of data scarcity in financial forecasting tasks.
