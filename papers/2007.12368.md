# [Self-Supervised Learning Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12368)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the research question of how self-supervised learning can be used to improve domain generalization and adaptation for visual recognition tasks. The key hypotheses are:1. Self-supervised pretraining on tasks like solving jigsaw puzzles or recognizing image rotations can provide useful invariances and regularization that improve generalization to new visual domains.2. Integrating self-supervised objectives like jigsaw puzzles or rotation recognition into a multi-task framework together with supervised learning can boost performance on domain generalization and adaptation benchmarks. 3. The self-supervised signals help focus the model on intrinsic shape properties rather than superficial statistics of a particular domain. This allows the learned representations to transfer better to new domains.4. A multi-task approach combining self-supervision and supervision within a single model works better than separate pretraining and finetuning stages for domain generalization.5. Self-supervision can complement and improve existing domain generalization and adaptation techniques by providing useful inductive biases.The paper presents extensive experiments to evaluate these hypotheses on standard domain generalization and adaptation datasets using self-supervised pretraining, multi-task learning, and combinations with existing methods. The results generally validate the potential of self-supervision for improving robustness across visual domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposes a multi-task learning approach that combines supervised learning with self-supervised learning for object recognition across visual domains. 2. Investigates two self-supervised pretext tasks - solving jigsaw puzzles and recognizing image orientation - and shows how they can be integrated seamlessly into the multi-task framework to improve cross-domain generalization.3. Evaluates the approach extensively for domain generalization and domain adaptation settings on several benchmark datasets. Shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization and adaptation methods.4. Extends the evaluation to more challenging settings like predictive domain adaptation and partial domain adaptation. Demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in these scenarios as well. 5. Provides detailed ablation studies and analysis to understand the effect of different components of the multi-task learning framework.In summary, the key idea is to leverage self-supervision to learn visual invariances and patterns that are robust across domains along with supervised semantic knowledge. The multi-task combination allows improving generalization across domains and adapting to new target distributions.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach that combines supervised learning for object recognition with self-supervised learning through solving jigsaw puzzles or recognizing image orientation, showing this helps with domain generalization and adaptation for object classification across different visual domains like photos, sketches and paintings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in domain adaptation and self-supervised learning:- This paper proposes a novel approach of using self-supervised learning within a multi-task framework to improve domain generalization and adaptation. Prior work has mostly studied self-supervision and domain adaptation separately. Combining them in a multi-task model is a new direction.- For the self-supervision, the authors use the pretext tasks of solving jigsaw puzzles and recognizing image rotations. These have been studied before in self-supervised learning research. The novelty is in applying them across domains along with the main supervised task.- For domain generalization, the multi-task self-supervised approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods that use more complex strategies like meta-learning, low-rank decomposition, adversarial feature alignment etc. The simplicity of self-supervision makes it an attractive regularizer.- For domain adaptation, the results are strong on multi-source scenarios where self-supervision helps align complex source data. On harder single source tasks, some adversarial methods still perform better.- The paper provides a thorough evaluation on standard domain generalization and adaptation datasets. The extensive comparisons and ablations are a valuable addition over prior self-supervision papers.- The idea of combining self-supervision with domain adaptation is relatively new. A concurrent work that does something similar is [Name Another Relevant Paper]. However, that uses a different self-supervised task.In summary, the paper provides a substantial empirical analysis of how self-supervised learning can improve generalization across domains. The simplicity and effectiveness make it a promising direction for further research.
