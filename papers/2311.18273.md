# [HKUST at SemEval-2023 Task 1: Visual Word Sense Disambiguation with   Context Augmentation and Visual Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18273)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-modal framework for visual word sense disambiguation (VWSD). The goal is to select the image from a set of candidates that best matches the meaning of a target word within a short context. Their system consists of four main components: (1) Gloss matching using a bi-encoder model to find the most contextually relevant sense definitions from WordNet; (2) Context augmentation by fitting the matched sense into a prompting template; (3) Image retrieval using the augmented context as a query for CLIP image retrieval; (4) Modality fusion of the text and images using average, MLP, and transformer fusers. Although their best fusion model achieves high accuracy on the training set, a baseline using just CLIP and the augmented text context performs better on the test set. They analyze this discrepancy in terms of differences in polysemy levels between training and test data, as well as potential error propagation from upstream tasks. Overall, their system demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging external knowledge bases and datasets to aid VWSD, providing insights into the difficulty of real-world application. Their work calls for advances in standalone WSD and vision-language models to truly benefit from a knowledge aggregation pipeline.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-modal framework for visual word sense disambiguation that matches contexts to word senses, prompts with definitions and synonyms, retrieves related images, and fuses textual and visual information, but finds a distribution gap between training and test data limits the performance of modality fusion methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a multi-modal retrieval framework that maximally leverages pretrained Vision-Language models, as well as open knowledge bases and datasets, to perform visual word sense disambiguation. 

Specifically, the key components of their proposed system include:

1) Gloss matching using a pretrained bi-encoder model to match contexts with word senses. 

2) Context augmentation through prompting by incorporating matched glosses and synonyms into a template.

3) Image retrieval using the augmented contexts as queries to retrieve relevant images from large datasets.

4) Modality fusion of the textual and visual information using different fusers (average, MLP, transformer) to make final predictions.

Although their system does not achieve state-of-the-art performance, the authors are able to gain insights into the task by identifying distribution gaps between the training and test data. They discuss issues with error propagation through the pipeline and the need for more robust word sense disambiguation and vision-language models. Overall, the main contribution is in proposing and analyzing a knowledge-based system that aggregates information from different modalities and resources to aid in this challenging visual word sense disambiguation task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) - The main task that the paper is addressing. It involves selecting the image that best matches the meaning of a target word within a limited context.

- SemEval-2023 Task 1 - The specific VWSD task and dataset that the paper is aiming to tackle, although the proposed system did not actually participate. 

- Disambiguate-and-discriminate strategy - The overall strategy taken of first disambiguating the word sense using external knowledge bases, then discriminating between candidate images.

- Gloss matching - Using a bi-encoder model to match the given context to gloss definitions from WordNet to find the closest sense. 

- Context augmentation - Enriching the limited context through prompting techniques, by fitting in matched gloss definitions and synonyms.

- Image retrieval - Retrieving additional visually-relevant images from external datasets using the augmented textual context. 

- Modality fusion - Combining the embedded information from augmented context and retrieved images using different fusion techniques like average, MLP, and Transformer.

- Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) - Leveraging this pretrained vision-language model for encoding texts and images.

So in summary, the key themes are VWSD, using external knowledge bases to augment context, fusing textual and visual modalities, and leveraging CLIP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a bi-encoder model for gloss matching. Can you explain in more detail how this bi-encoder model works and how it matches contexts with word senses? 

2. The paper incorporates matched glosses and other textual information into a prompting template. What is the motivation behind using this prompting strategy? How does it help with the task of visual word sense disambiguation?

3. The paper retrieves additional images using the augmented context as a query. Why is retrieving additional images useful? How many additional images are retrieved for the training and testing sets?

4. The paper experiments with three different modality fusion techniques - average fuser, MLP fuser, and transformer fuser. Can you explain the differences in how these techniques work and their relative advantages/disadvantages? 

5. The transformer fuser performs much better on the training and validation sets compared to the test set. What reasons does the paper give to explain this discrepancy? Do you have any other hypotheses?

6. The paper concludes that the success of their method relies on the quality of the external knowledge retrieved. What could be done to make the gloss matching and image retrieval stages more robust? 

7. The statistics in Table 2 show a distribution shift between the training and test sets. How might this distribution shift impact the performance of the different components in the pipeline?

8. Could the prompting strategy used be improved or altered to better handle words with multiple senses? What changes might you suggest?

9. Error analysis reveals cases where errors accumulate along the pipeline. Other than the example given, what are some other potential sources of error accumulation?  

10. The paper frames VWSD as a "disambiguate-and-discriminate" strategy. Do you think alternative problem formulations could work better? What would they be?
