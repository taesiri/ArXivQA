# [Spikformer V2: Join the High Accuracy Club on ImageNet with an SNN   Ticket](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible and hardware efficient than regular artificial neural networks (ANNs), but have lagged significantly in performance, with no SNN achieving over 80% accuracy on ImageNet image classification.

- Self-attention has been instrumental to progress in ANNs through Transformers, but direct application of standard self-attention to SNNs is impractical due to reliance on expensive floating point multiplications and softmax.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Spikformer, the first spiking Transformer that works directly on spike inputs through a novel Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism tailored to leverage sparsity. 

- SSA uses spike query, key and value matrices that allow computation using logic operations without multiplications, eliminating the need for softmax normalization. This makes SSA efficient for processing spikes.

- The paper also proposes a Spiking Convolutional Stem for improved feature extraction over the original Spikformer.

- To further improve performance, the paper explores self-supervised pretraining on SNNs for the first time through masked image modeling, enabling stable training of larger Spikformer models.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first spiking Transformer and spiking self-attention mechanism, achieving new SOTA results for SNNs on ImageNet (80.38% top-1 accuracy).

- Develops Spiking Convolutional Stem to enhance feature extraction capability.

- Introduces self-supervised learning to SNNs and shows strong performance gains from pretraining larger Spikformer models.

- Achieves over 80% ImageNet accuracy with an SNN for the first time, challenging perceptions of SNN performance limitations.

- With computational efficiency and biological plausibility, Spikformer demonstrates SNNs can match ANN accuracy while being suitable for specialized neuromorphic hardware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Spikformer V2, a spiking neural network transformer architecture that achieves over 80% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet image classification through architectural optimizations like a Spiking Convolutional Stem and self-supervised pre-training innovations tailored for spiking neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes a novel Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism and Spiking Transformer architecture called Spikformer, which is the first work to explore self-attention and Transformer models for spiking neural networks (SNNs). SSA captures sparse visual features using spike-based query, key and value without needing softmax.

2. It develops a Spiking Convolutional Stem (SCS) module to enhance Spikformer, leading to an updated model called Spikformer V2. SCS uses convolutional layers for patch embedding instead of max pooling to avoid information loss.

3. It introduces a pioneering exploration of self-supervised learning for SNNs using a mask autoencoder approach inspired by MAE. This allows pre-training Spikformer V2 for better performance.

4. Extensive experiments show the models achieve state-of-the-art results among SNN methods on ImageNet, with Spikformer V2 reaching over 80% accuracy for the first time for SNNs on ImageNet. This demonstrates the potential of spiking self-attention and transformers for high-performance and efficient SNNs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing novel spiking self-attention and Spiking Transformer architectures that achieve new state-of-the-art results for SNNs on ImageNet while maintaining computational efficiency.
