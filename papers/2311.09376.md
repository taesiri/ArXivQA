# [DISTA: Denoising Spiking Transformer with intrinsic plasticity and   spatiotemporal attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09376)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DISTA, a novel spiking transformer architecture for vision that incorporates denoising and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms. Compared to prior spiking transformers limited to spatial attention, DISTA explores spatiotemporal attention at both the neuron level, by optimizing intrinsic membrane time constants of neurons through plasticity, and the network level, by using explicit memory to enable attention across time as well as space. Additionally, DISTA employs an efficient nonlinear denoising technique to filter noise in the computed attention maps, further enhancing performance. Through joint training involving both synaptic and intrinsic plasticity tuning, DISTA delivers state-of-the-art accuracy across CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and a neuromorphic CIFAR10-DVS dataset, significantly outperforming previous spiking transformers and other SNN models. The proposed spatiotemporal attention and denoising methods provide a strong foundation for building high-performance spiking transformers that can fully utilize the dynamic computational capabilities of spiking neural networks.

2. It explores two types of spatiotemporal attention mechanisms - (i) neuron-level attention by optimizing the intrinsic membrane time constants of neurons using intrinsic plasticity, and (ii) network-level attention with explicit memory to capture long-range spatiotemporal correlations.

3. It introduces an efficient nonlinear denoising mechanism called Attention DeNoising (ADN) to suppress noise in the computed spatiotemporal attention maps, which further improves performance.

4. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DISTA, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across several static image datasets (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) as well as dynamic neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS) compared to prior spiking transformer works.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two types of spatiotemporal attention mechanisms - intrinsic neural-level attention and explicit network-level attention. Can you explain in more detail the differences between these two types of attentions and why both are needed? 

2. Intrinsic plasticity is used to optimize the neuron-level spatiotemporal attention by tuning the membrane time constant (tau_m) of each neuron. Walk through the mathematical details of how tuning tau_m leads to different spatiotemporal attention characteristics.

3. For the network-level spatiotemporal attention, temporal attention windows (TAWs) of different sizes are experimented with. Provide an in-depth analysis of the tradeoffs between TAW size, computation/memory requirements and performance. Explain why performance saturates after a certain TAW size.

4. The paper mentions that the computed spike-based attention maps can be noisy. Elaborate on the potential sources of noise in these maps and how the proposed Attention DeNoising (ADN) mechanism mathematically suppresses this noise. 

5. The ADN employs a non-linear hard thresholding operation. Analyze the benefits of introducing this non-linearity into the spiking transformer in terms of representation power. Compare and contrast with the non-linearities provides by the LIF neurons.

6. The paper demonstrates superior results on both static image datasets (CIFAR10/100) and dynamic neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS). Explain how the proposed spatiotemporal computations provide added benefits for processing such dynamic spike-based video data.

7. Provide an in-depth analysis of the time and space complexities of all components of the proposed DISTA spiking transformer,highlighting the modules that contribute the most additional computations over the baseline method.

8. The DISTA transformer undergoes joint training of both synaptic weights and intrinsic neuron parameters. Walk through the details of the gradient calculations and update rules for this joint optimization scheme. 

9. Analyze the hardware implementation costs of the proposed modules (e.g. ADN) on a spiking neuromorphic platform. Would approximations or modifications be necessary?

10. The paper focuses on computer vision tasks. Discuss how the proposed spatiotemporal attention mechanisms can be exploited or adapted for other modalities and tasks such as speech or natural language processing.
