# [Knowledge-Driven Modulation of Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism   for Next Activity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08847)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a Symbolic[Neuro] system for next activity prediction (NAP) that integrates neural networks with attention mechanisms (NN) with background knowledge in the form of a procedural process model (a Petri net model). The approach addresses under-sampled trace variants in the test set by modulating the NN probability scores with a compliance score between the predicted activities and the Petri net, using a beam search algorithm. Rather than a binary compliance check at the end like prior approaches, the proposed method continuously modulates the NN predictions during the construction of the predicted suffix, allowing the background knowledge to guide the beam search. Experiments on synthetic and real-life logs showed situations where this knowledge-guided modulation significantly improved NAP performance, especially for exceptional executions. The method allows effective use of procedural models as background knowledge, rather than just declarative constraints. The combination of attention-based NNs with guided modulation enables precise NAP in scenarios with concept drifts, where variants become more frequent than seen during training. This Symbolic[Neuro] approach advances the state-of-the-art in effectively leveraging background knowledge for improved predictive process monitoring.
