# [TexDreamer: Towards Zero-Shot High-Fidelity 3D Human Texture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12906)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Texturing 3D human models with semantic UV maps remains challenging due to the difficulty of acquiring reasonably unfolded UV textures for training. 
- Despite recent advances in text-to-3D methods using text-to-image models, issues persist with generation speed, text consistency, and texture quality. This results in data scarcity for high-fidelity 3D human textures.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose TexDreamer, the first zero-shot multimodal high-fidelity 3D human texture generation model that can generate textures from either text or image descriptions.
- They use an efficient texture adaptation fine-tuning strategy to adapt a large text-to-image model to a semantic UV structure while preserving its generalization capability. This is the Text-to-UV (T2UV) module.
- For the Image-to-UV (I2UV) module, they build a feature translator to map image features to the text feature space to connect images and UV textures semantically.
- They also construct a large-scale high-resolution 3D human texture dataset called ATLAS with 50K textures at 1024x1024 resolution along with text descriptions.

Main Contributions:
- TexDreamer - the first zero-shot multimodal model for high-fidelity 3D human texture generation that supports both text and image inputs.
- An efficient texture adaptation fine-tuning strategy to adapt text-to-image models to UV space while retaining generalization.
- A feature translator to connect image and UV textures semantically via text feature space.
- ATLAS dataset - the largest high-resolution 3D human texture dataset with 50K 1024x1024 textures and textual descriptions.

The experiments demonstrate TexDreamer generates higher quality and more consistent textures compared to previous state-of-the-art methods for both text and image inputs. The ATLAS dataset also addresses the lack of high-fidelity semantic 3D human textures.
