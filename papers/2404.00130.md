# [FISBe: A real-world benchmark dataset for instance segmentation of   long-range thin filamentous structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00130)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instance segmentation of neurons in light microscopy (LM) images is very challenging due to the long, thin filamentous shape of neurons, tight interweaving of multiple neurons, and imaging issues like noise and uneven illumination. 
- Existing benchmarks and methods do not properly address the key challenge of capturing long-range dependencies in such data.
- There is a lack of real-world thin filamentous instance segmentation benchmark datasets to facilitate methods development.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors release FISBe, the first public benchmark dataset of real-world light microscopy images for instance segmentation of wide-ranging, thin filamentous, intertwined neurons.
- The dataset contains 101 large 3D images with pixel-wise expert annotations of 590 individual neurons. 30 images are completely labeled, 71 are partly labeled.
- A set of suitable instance segmentation metrics is proposed, including a novel aggregate benchmark score to account for the intricacies of the data.
- Three baseline methods (PatchPerPix, FFN, color clustering) are evaluated on the dataset using the proposed metrics.

Main Contributions:
- FISBe dataset with expert annotations to enable research on one of machine learning's open challenges: capturing long-range dependencies.
- Novel evaluation metrics and benchmark score tailored to thin filamentous structures and downstream tasks.
- Evidence that existing methods struggle on FISBe data, underlining a gap in current approaches.
- FISBe has the potential to advance machine learning methodology and basic neuroscience discoveries regarding neuronal morphology and connectivity.
