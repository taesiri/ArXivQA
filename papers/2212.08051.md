# [Objaverse: A Universe of Annotated 3D Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can a large-scale 3D asset dataset like Objaverse enable new applications and research directions across computer vision and AI?

The authors present Objaverse, a dataset of over 800K 3D models paired with descriptive metadata. They argue that existing 3D datasets are limited in scale and diversity, preventing progress on 3D tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate the potential of Objaverse to support diverse applications through experiments on:

- 3D generative modeling, showing Objaverse can train higher quality and more diverse models compared to existing datasets. 

- Instance segmentation, where augmenting with Objaverse assets improves performance on rare classes.

- Open vocabulary object navigation, where Objaverse enables training embodied agents on orders of magnitude more objects and categories. 

- Analyzing model robustness by creating benchmarks with Objaverse for evaluating orientation invariance.

Overall, the central hypothesis seems to be that the scale and diversity of Objaverse can unlock new applications and research directions compared to existing mid-sized 3D datasets. The experiments aim to provide evidence for this potential across multiple areas like generation, segmentation, robotics, and analysis.
