# [Agile Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Agile Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation":

Problem:
- Multi-source domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to an unlabeled target domain. 
- Existing methods require extensive parameter tuning over each source model, making them computationally expensive for problems with many source domains or large models.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel Bi-level Attention Ensemble (Bi-ATEN) module to learn both intra-domain weights and inter-domain ensemble weights.
- Intra-domain weights find the most compatible classifier for each source feature to mitigate transferability mismatches. 
- Inter-domain weights ensemble the domain outputs into the final prediction.
- Only tune small bottleneck layers in source models instead of full models.
- Alternate training focuses on domain-specific pairs in some epochs and intra-domain compatibility in other epochs.

Main Contributions:
- Bi-ATEN balances instance specificity and domain consistency for effective adaptation.
- A light version called ATEN can be easily plugged into existing methods as their weight learning module.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on DomainNet using Swin Transformer with less than 3% trained parameters and 8x throughput compared to prior art.
- Demonstrate the ability to handle large models with minor tuning while significantly reducing computational costs.
- Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of both Bi-ATEN and ATEN over strong baselines.

In summary, the paper presents an agile and effective approach for multi-source domain adaptation that can scale to settings with abundant source domains and large models, overcoming limitations of prior arts. The core Bi-ATEN module strikes a balance between instance specificity and domain consistency in the ensemble.
