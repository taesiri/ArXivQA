# [MIGC: Multi-Instance Generation Controller for Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-instance generation (MIG) in text-to-image synthesis. MIG involves simultaneously generating multiple instances with diverse controls like position, attributes, interactions, etc in a single image based on text descriptions. Current text-to-image models struggle with MIG tasks and fail to achieve precise control over quantity, layout, attributes of generated instances simultaneously.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC) approach based on the principle of "divide and conquer". The key ideas are:

1) Divide MIG into multiple single-instance generation subtasks that are easier to solve. 

2) Conquer the subtasks using an Enhancement Attention mechanism to precisely control each instance's attributes.

3) Combine the results of subtasks through a Layout Attention and Shading Aggregation Controller to ensure global coherence.

Main Contributions:

1) Defines the MIG problem to advance text-to-image generation research.

2) Proposes a COCO-MIG benchmark to evaluate models on simultaneous control of attributes, layout and quantity.

3) Introduces an innovative MIGC approach that enhances Stable Diffusion to achieve stronger MIG capabilities through divide-conquer-combine strategy.

4) Experiments show MIGC significantly improves state-of-the-art on COCO-MIG benchmark and other datasets, demonstrating exceptional control over instance quantity, positions, attributes and interactions.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in formulating the MIG problem, benchmarking MIG capabilities, and advancing text-to-image generation via the proposed MIGC approach to achieve fine-grained control over multi-instance image synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC) approach that enhances stable diffusion for simultaneously generating multiple instances with precise control over their attributes and positions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting the Multi-Instance Generation (MIG) task to address prevailing challenges in both academic and industrial domains, and proposing the COCO-MIG benchmark to evaluate the inherent MIG capabilities of generative models.

2) Introducing a novel MIGC approach that enhances pre-trained stable diffusion with improved MIG capabilities, inspired by the principle of divide and conquer. MIGC decomposes the complex MIG task into multiple simpler single-instance generation subtasks, conquers each subtask, and then combines the results.

3) Conducting extensive experiments on three benchmarks, showing that MIGC significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods while ensuring the inference speed is close to original stable diffusion. The experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of MIGC for the MIG task.
