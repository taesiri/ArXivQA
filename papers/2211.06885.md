# [SCOTCH and SODA: A Transformer Video Shadow Detection Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an effective video shadow detection framework that handles the inherent challenges of detecting shadows in videos, namely the large deformation of shadows between frames?The key hypotheses proposed in this paper are:1) Modelling the deformation of shadows over time is essential for effective video shadow detection. To address this, the authors propose a new spatial-temporal aggregation module called SODA (Shadow Deformation Attention Trajectory) that is designed to capture shadow deformation trajectories in videos. 2) Learning robust and discriminative representations of shadows is critical. To achieve this, the authors propose SCOTCH (Shadow Contrastive Mechanism), a supervised contrastive loss that drives the model to learn invariant high-level features for shadow regions across different videos.In summary, the core innovations proposed to tackle the video shadow detection problem are:- SODA module to model temporal deformation of shadows- SCOTCH contrastive loss for robust shadow representationsThe central hypothesis is that by designing a model architecture and training process specifically catered for video shadows (with SODA and SCOTCH), superior performance can be achieved compared to existing methods on this task. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A new video shadow detection framework consisting of:- SODA: A new spatial-temporal aggregation module called Shadow Deformation Attention trajectory that is designed to handle the large shadow deformations in videos. - SCOTCH: A new shadow contrastive learning mechanism that guides the network to learn more robust and unified shadow representations across videos.2. Evaluation of the proposed framework on the ViSha video shadow detection benchmark dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. 3. Ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of SODA and SCOTCH.In summary, the key innovations are the shadow deformation attention trajectory module and the shadow contrastive learning mechanism. SODA accounts for shadow deformation between frames while SCOTCH drives the model to learn invariant shadow features across different videos. Together, they allow the framework to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the task of video shadow detection.
