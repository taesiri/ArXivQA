# [Offline Writer Identification Using Convolutional Neural Network   Activation Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offline writer identification aims to identify the writer of a handwritten document based only on the textural and allograph information in the document, without any dynamic writing information.
- Existing methods use handcrafted features like SIFT or SURF with encoding techniques like Fisher vectors. But these may not capture higher-level patterns in the writing style.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn descriptive features from image patches centered on the contours of the writing. The CNN activations capture writing style information. 
- Aggregate CNN features from a document using GMM supervector encoding with only mean adaptation. This compacts the information effectively. 
- Normalize the supervector with the KL-kernel to implicitly add variance and weight information while reducing dimensionality.

Contributions:
- First use of a CNN to learn local features for writer identification task, shows significant gains over SIFT and SURF features.
- Modification of GMM supervector encoding by using only mean adaptation and KL-kernel normalization, improving over standard Hellinger kernel normalization.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on ICDAR 2013 benchmark dataset with 0.21 absolute increase in mAP, and comparable performance to state-of-the-art on CVL dataset.
- Shows features learned from ICDAR generalize well to other datasets like CVL without retraining CNN.

In summary, a CNN is used to learn powerful allograph features for writer identification. An optimized GMM supervector encoding and normalization further improves performance beyond previous methods.
