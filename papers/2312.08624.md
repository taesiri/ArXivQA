# [Mixed Reality Communication for Medical Procedures: Teaching the   Placement of a Central Venous Catheter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08624)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a mixed reality (MR) communication system that enables remote expert guidance of medical procedures. The system allows an expert to guide a local trainee through an ultrasound-guided central venous catheter (CVC) placement procedure using augmented visualizations and gestural communication. The setup uses HoloLens headsets and Azure Kinect RGBD cameras for volumetric capture, real-time mesh reconstruction, and alignment between the remote expert and local operator. A distributed 3D scene reconstruction algorithm runs on both server and client to enable lightweight, mobile processing. The system was evaluated in a user study comparing MR guidance to standard video conferencing for teaching CVC placement. Results showed MR provides an effective alternative for procedure training without significantly increasing workload. Both instructors and learners provided positive feedback on the MR system's capabilities for spatial understanding, needle guidance, gestural communication, and coordinating tool usage. While focused on a specific medical application, the general approach could be extended to remote guidance across other procedural skills training and assistance scenarios. Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of MR and volumetric capture to enhance traditional video communication.
