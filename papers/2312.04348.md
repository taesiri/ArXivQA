# [When Input Integers are Given in the Unary Numeral Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04348)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores how using unary representations of integers, instead of the more conventional binary representations, impacts the computational complexity of various combinatorial problems. Many NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even with unary integer inputs ("strong NP-completeness"), but some become easier. This paper studies problems in the latter category, such as variants of the knapsack and subset sum problems. When input integers are represented in unary, these problems can be solved in nondeterministic logarithmic space (NL). The paper proves NL-completeness results for path problems on edge-weighted directed acyclic graphs, showing equivalence to a restricted unary knapsack problem. It also considers lattice problems like the closest vector problem and shortest vector problem under max/min norms. By reducing a simultaneous unary knapsack variant to the unary closest vector problem, the paper shows the latter is not obviously in NP and may require more complex alternating machines. Overall, examining these non-strong NP-complete problems with unary integer inputs highlights structural differences from conventional NP-completeness and opens up new research directions in space-bounded computation and lattice algorithms.
