# [When Input Integers are Given in the Unary Numeral Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04348)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores how using unary representations of integers, instead of the more conventional binary representations, impacts the computational complexity of various combinatorial problems. Many NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even with unary integer inputs ("strong NP-completeness"), but some become easier. This paper studies problems in the latter category, such as variants of the knapsack and subset sum problems. When input integers are represented in unary, these problems can be solved in nondeterministic logarithmic space (NL). The paper proves NL-completeness results for path problems on edge-weighted directed acyclic graphs, showing equivalence to a restricted unary knapsack problem. It also considers lattice problems like the closest vector problem and shortest vector problem under max/min norms. By reducing a simultaneous unary knapsack variant to the unary closest vector problem, the paper shows the latter is not obviously in NP and may require more complex alternating machines. Overall, examining these non-strong NP-complete problems with unary integer inputs highlights structural differences from conventional NP-completeness and opens up new research directions in space-bounded computation and lattice algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the computational complexity of various combinatorial problems when input integers are given in unary representation, showing that many problems become more tractable compared to the binary representation case.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper studies the computational complexity of various combinatorial problems when input integers are given in the unary numeral representation, as opposed to the more conventional binary representation. The main contributions are:

1) Introducing and analyzing numerous problems related to numbers, graphs, and lattices where input integers are represented in unary. This includes variants of the knapsack problem, path problems on graphs, closest/shortest vector problems on lattices, etc.

2) Determining the precise complexity of these unary problems in many cases, showing that they often become easier (e.g. solvable in NL or other small complexity classes) compared to their binary counterparts which are typically NP-complete. 

3) Highlighting the difference between strong vs non-strong NP-completeness based on whether a problem remains hard with unary or binary integer inputs. Many examples of non-strong NP-complete problems are given.

4) Providing a range of reductions, simulations, and containment results related to complexity classes like NL, co-NL, LOGCFL when numbers are given in unary.

In summary, the paper systematically studies the impact of unary integer representations on the complexity of problems, in order to better understand when and why this representation makes problems easier or harder. A taxonomy of easy vs hard unary problems is developed.

The paper studies how representing input integers in unary, instead of binary, affects the computational complexity of various combinatorial problems like knapsack problems, graph problems, lattice problems etc. Many of these problems are NP-complete with binary integer inputs but become more tractable (solvable in log-space or by pushdown automata) with unary inputs. The paper highlights this difference between strong vs non-strong NP-completeness. Overall, the computational complexity implications of unarizing integer inputs seems to be the core theme.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses transforming several NP-complete problems into problems solvable in NL when inputs are given in unary. What are some other well-known NP-complete problems that could be studied in this framework to determine if they also become tractable?

2. Could the techniques used in transforming the knapsack problem to the unary knapsack problem be applied to transform other optimization problems to unary versions? What issues might arise in trying to adapt the methods?

3. The paper proves several equivalences between variants of the unary knapsack problem. What other natural variants could be introduced and how might their complexity relate to the problems discussed?

4. Proposition 3 shows a reduction from the simultaneous unary knapsack problem to the unary closest vector problem. What other lattice problems could reductions be shown to from unary variants of NP-complete problems?

5. The paper focuses on problems solvable in NL. Could similar techniques be used to transform problems to solvability in NC? What additional difficulties might be encountered? 

6. Several restricted variants of the edge-weighted path problem are discussed. What other natural restrictions could be considered and how might they relate to the complexity of the general version?

7. The paper encodes directed acyclic graphs in a unary adjacency list representation. What are some other graph representations that could be adapted to work with unary inputs? What effect might they have?

8. How robust are the equivalences shown between problems in the paper? For instance, if minor restrictions were added to the unary knapsack problem before reduction, could the resulting problem still reduce to unambiguous UK?

9. Practical applications often have numerical constraints on problem inputs. How might adding common constraints like integer bounds change the complexity results?

10. The problems operate on unary integers. What differences might be observed if alternate succinct representations were used instead, like a hybrid unary/binary representation?
