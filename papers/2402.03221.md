# ["Define Your Terms" : Enhancing Efficient Offensive Speech   Classification with Definition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive speech detection is an important problem, but definitions vary across datasets. Constructing sufficient labeled data is resource intensive.  
- Goal is to leverage existing datasets to reliably and efficiently adapt models to new offensive speech domains, especially in low-resource settings.

Methods:
- Compiled 14 datasets, 10 for meta-training and 4 held-out for testing (ToxiGen, HateXplain, Implicit_hate, Covid).
- Explored baseline fine-tuning, meta-learning techniques like ProtoNet, MAML, MLDG to enhance generalization.  
- Proposed label-aware models like ProtoNet_Token, ProtoNet_Label and joint embedding model JE_ProtoNet that incorporates label definitions into the classification process.

Key Findings:
- Meta-learning alone doesn't improve over baselines. Label-aware ProtoNet variants also don't help much.
- JE_ProtoNet leveraging label definitions consistently achieves top performance across test datasets. 
- With only 1-10% of max training data, JE_ProtoNet_CLS attains 75-100% of state of the art metrics on the 4 test datasets.
- Label definitions are beneficial for offensive speech detection. Recommendations provided for low resource settings.

Main Contributions:
- First work to incorporate category definitions for offensive speech classification via joint embedding between input and definitions.
- Extensive experiments on semantic adaptation across 14 datasets.
- Demonstrated high sample efficiency in low resource scenarios.
- Provided recommendations for offline selection of training data.
