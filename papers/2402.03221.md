# ["Define Your Terms" : Enhancing Efficient Offensive Speech   Classification with Definition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive speech detection is an important problem, but definitions vary across datasets. Constructing sufficient labeled data is resource intensive.  
- Goal is to leverage existing datasets to reliably and efficiently adapt models to new offensive speech domains, especially in low-resource settings.

Methods:
- Compiled 14 datasets, 10 for meta-training and 4 held-out for testing (ToxiGen, HateXplain, Implicit_hate, Covid).
- Explored baseline fine-tuning, meta-learning techniques like ProtoNet, MAML, MLDG to enhance generalization.  
- Proposed label-aware models like ProtoNet_Token, ProtoNet_Label and joint embedding model JE_ProtoNet that incorporates label definitions into the classification process.

Key Findings:
- Meta-learning alone doesn't improve over baselines. Label-aware ProtoNet variants also don't help much.
- JE_ProtoNet leveraging label definitions consistently achieves top performance across test datasets. 
- With only 1-10% of max training data, JE_ProtoNet_CLS attains 75-100% of state of the art metrics on the 4 test datasets.
- Label definitions are beneficial for offensive speech detection. Recommendations provided for low resource settings.

Main Contributions:
- First work to incorporate category definitions for offensive speech classification via joint embedding between input and definitions.
- Extensive experiments on semantic adaptation across 14 datasets.
- Demonstrated high sample efficiency in low resource scenarios.
- Provided recommendations for offline selection of training data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a joint embedding architecture that incorporates the input text, label, and label definition to efficiently adapt pretrained models for few-shot offensive speech classification across diverse datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a joint embedding architecture that incorporates the input's label and definition for classification via Prototypical Network. Specifically:

- They propose JE_ProtoNet, which is a joint embedding model that utilizes both the label and the textual definition of that label when classifying offensive speech. This allows the model to leverage additional semantic information beyond just the label itself.

- They show that incorporating label definitions helps improve performance across multiple offensive speech datasets, especially in low-resource settings. For example, their model achieves competitive results while using less than 10% of the available training data on some datasets.

- Their analysis provides recommendations for efficiently adapting models to new offensive speech domains. They suggest an iterative data collection and model testing approach that can achieve good performance with relatively small training sets.

So in summary, the key contribution is using label definitions via a joint embedding technique to enhance offensive speech classification, particularly when training data is scarce. The paper provides both the model architecture and practical guidance on efficient adaptation.

The paper explores using existing offensive speech datasets to efficiently adapt models to new domains of offensive content. It proposes a joint embedding architecture called JE_ProtoNet that incorporates the input text, label, and label definition for classification. The approach is evaluated on 4 held-out datasets spanning different types of offensive speech. The models aim to achieve good performance while using a fraction of the available training data. Key results show JE_ProtoNet can attain over 75% of maximal F1 score with less than 10% training data on the test sets. The paper also provides a case study on training strategies for offensive speech classification under resource constraints.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a joint embedding architecture called JE_ProtoNet that incorporates the input's label and definition for classification via Prototypical Network. Can you explain in detail how the label and definition are incorporated into the model architecture? 

2. The paper finds that simply appending the full definition to the input is not effective. Why do you think directly concatenating the full definition hurts performance? How does the proposed JE_ProtoNet architecture address this?

3. The JE_ProtoNet model outperforms other variants with label information across test datasets. What properties of the joint embedding architecture make it more robust than simply using label tokens or directly concatenating labels?

4. Pre-training JE_ProtoNet via meta-learning is shown to provide better initialization versus random initialization. Why is pre-training important for this architecture? What benefits does the meta-learning approach provide?

5. The paper shows JE_ProtoNet can attain high percentages of maximum reported F1 scores while using a fraction of available training data on the test datasets. What modifications to the data and model enable this sample-efficient performance?

6. For tasks with scarce labeled data, the paper provides recommendations to iterate data collection and model training. What metrics are suggested to guide this iterative process? What model configurations are recommended for starting this process?

7. The paper hypothesizes enhancing JE_ProtoNet to overcome its inductive bias limitations. This is realized via JE_ProtoNet_CLS. Explain how the classification head addresses limitations of the base JE_ProtoNet model.

8. Label definitions are shown to provide useful signal for enhancing classification. For tasks where definitions are unavailable, what are some potential ways to incorporate additional semantic information about categories?

9. The approach is evaluated on English offensive speech detection. What are some challenges and considerations for applying this method to other languages and tasks?

10. The joint embedding architecture relies on transformer self-attention. How could recent self-supervised models be explored or adapted to provide stronger semantic representations as input to the joint embedding?
