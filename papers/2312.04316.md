## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging paradigm of knowledge-driven autonomous driving. It highlights how incorporating human knowledge and reasoning into autonomous systems can enhance their performance, safety, and interpretability. The authors systematically analyze the core components of knowledge-driven autonomous driving: datasets and benchmarks augmented with natural language to align with human cognition; high-fidelity virtual environments powered by innovations like neural rendering to enable efficient simulation; and intelligent driver agents built on large language models that possess robust comprehension and reasoning abilities analogous to human drivers. They present a generalized knowledge-driven framework encompassing critical faculties like perception, planning, reflection and memory to achieve driving scenario understanding and strategic decision-making. The paper discusses opportunities in areas such as multimodal understanding through vision-language models as well as validation requirements for knowledge-driven systems. It provides valuable insights and guidance to steer ongoing research towards realizing more intelligent, reliable and transparent autonomous driving systems. However, challenges remain in efficiently incorporating human knowledge, ensuring safety, and comprehensive validation.
