# [Cheaply Evaluating Inference Efficiency Metrics for Autoregressive   Transformer APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02440)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research questions and hypotheses of this paper appear to be:

- Can we develop an inference efficiency metric that allows for apples-to-apples comparisons of language models across different providers and implementations? The authors hypothesize that the proposed "idealized runtime" metric can achieve this by estimating the runtime as though models were run in a uniform software and hardware environment without performance contention.

- Is it possible to efficiently estimate the idealized runtime for autoregressive Transformer models without exhaustively profiling every possible prompt and output length? The authors hypothesize that the runtime can be parameterized as a linear function of output length and piecewise linear function of prompt length. 

- Does analyzing models using the proposed idealized runtime metric reveal different insights about efficiency vs capability tradeoffs compared to traditional metrics like raw runtimes or model size? The authors hypothesize that models may appear more efficient using raw runtimes due to orthogonal optimizations in the serving systems, and that the idealized runtime can uncover the true tradeoffs.

In summary, the key research questions involve developing an interpretable and comparable efficiency metric for language models, efficiently estimating this metric, and using it to uncover new insights about efficiency-capability tradeoffs across models and providers. The idealized runtime metric is proposed as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing new metrics to quantify the inference efficiency of large language models available through blackbox APIs. The key ideas are:

- Proposing an "idealized runtime" metric that estimates how long inference would take on standardized hardware/software, allowing for apples-to-apples comparison across models. This accounts for optimizations like caching that may speed up some models' APIs. 

- Showing the runtime can be modeled as a piecewise linear function of prompt size and a linear function of number of output tokens. This allows estimating the idealized runtime efficiently with just a small amount of profiling.

- Proposing a "denoised runtime" metric that removes noise from runtime measurements to estimate the true runtime devoid of performance variability.

- Demonstrating how these metrics enable analyzing efficiency-capability tradeoffs across models, surfacing insights like optimizations in certain APIs and relative costs across hardware.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing novel metrics to quantify and compare the inference efficiency of blackbox language models in a fair and consistent way. This facilitates better understanding of efficiency-capability tradeoffs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new metric called "idealized runtime" to compare the inference efficiency of large language models accessed through black-box APIs. The key idea is to estimate how long inference would take on standardized hardware/software by fitting a model to runtimes from a small set of profiler queries. This allows efficient comparison of models on an "apples-to-apples" basis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on evaluating large language models:

- Focus on inference efficiency: Much prior work has focused on the computational costs of training large language models. This paper provides a novel analysis specifically looking at inference efficiency and the tradeoffs between model capabilities and inference runtime/costs. 

- Black-box setting: Many benchmarking efforts like BIG-Bench assume full access to model internals. This paper tackles the more realistic setting where models are only available through commercial APIs with limited information.

- Runtime estimation methodology: The paper develops a new methodology to estimate the "idealized runtime" metric that accounts for differences in hardware and software optimizations across providers. This allows for more standardized comparisons. Prior work has used raw runtimes or FLOPs as proxies.

- Analysis of real-world models: The analysis looks at 10 major LLMs spanning 6-530B parameters. Many analyses rely on synthetic models or a narrow set of models from a single provider. This evaluates models from multiple sources including OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Cohere, etc.

- Novel findings: The analysis reveals new insights about efficiency-capability tradeoffs and performance differences, like the fact that certain providers' efficiency gains are more due to API optimizations than model architecture. The methodology also enables comparing software/hardware configurations.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions by tackling inference efficiency comparisons in the realistic black-box setting. The runtime estimation methodology and analysis of real-world models from multiple providers using the idealized metrics are novel. The findings highlight the value of empirical efficiency analyses beyond just model scale or FLOPs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend the methodology for efficiently estimating inference runtimes to other model architectures beyond Transformers. The current method is tailored to Transformer models, but estimating runtimes for other architectures currently requires more expensive profiling. Developing efficient methods for other architectures would broaden the applicability of the analysis.

- Further study the implications of different objective functions for trading off accuracy and inference efficiency. The authors show that the relative ranking of models can change significantly depending on the exact objective used. More research is needed to understand the pros and cons of different objectives in various real-world applications.

- Incorporate training costs into the analysis in addition to inference costs. The estimated inference costs in the paper do not account for model training costs, which are substantial. Estimating full lifecycle costs could lead to different conclusions.

- Evaluate the methodology on more models, including models not currently available through black-box APIs. The analysis is currently limited to publicly available models, but could be expanded.

- Develop standardized suites of benchmarks for comparing inference efficiency across models, similar to efforts for comparing capabilities like BIG-Bench. This could facilitate more systematic comparisons.

- Extend the techniques to compare different hardware and software stacks for inference. The paper shows this is possible, but more comprehensive comparisons could be illuminating.

In summary, the authors lay out a research agenda focused on expanding the methodology to new models and tasks, incorporating additional factors like training costs, developing benchmarks, and enabling comparisons across diverse hardware and software systems. Their framework enables analyses not previously possible, but there are many opportunities to build on it further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new metrics to efficiently estimate and compare the inference efficiency of large language models available through black-box APIs. The key metric proposed is the "idealized runtime", which estimates how long inference would take on standardized hardware and software, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across models. The authors show analytically and empirically that the runtime for autoregressive text generation with Transformer models can be expressed as the sum of a piecewise linear function of the prompt size and a linear function of the number of output tokens. This allows the idealized runtime to be estimated efficiently by profiling models on a small set of prompts. Using the proposed methodology, the authors compare 10 state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze the tradeoffs between efficiency and capabilities. They find that raw runtimes from APIs do not reflect the true efficiency of the underlying models due to optimizations and performance variability in the APIs. The idealized runtime provides a better estimate of the efficiency of the models themselves.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new metrics for comparing the inference efficiency of autoregressive Transformer language models accessible through black-box APIs. The proposed "idealized runtime" metric estimates how long inference would take on standardized hardware/software by fitting a model to runtimes from a small number of profiling queries. This allows efficient apples-to-apples comparisons across models served through different APIs. The "idealized runtime" sums a piecewise linear function of prompt length and a linear function of number of output tokens, with parameters fit using runtimes of configuration queries. 

The authors use these metrics to analyze 10 major LLMs. They find that raw latency from APIs is misleading, as optimizations like caching can vary. The idealized metrics reveal interesting tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy across models and scenarios. For instance, GPT-3 is often on the Pareto frontier for raw latency but not when using idealized runtimes, indicating optimizations in the API rather than the model. Overall, the proposed methodology facilitates analyzing efficiency-capability tradeoffs with black-box ML APIs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper proposes a new inference efficiency metric called the "idealized runtime" to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons of large language models (LLMs) served through black-box APIs. The idealized runtime estimates the query runtime as though the model was served on uniform hardware and software without performance contention. The key insight enabling efficient estimation of this metric is that the runtime of autoregressive text generation with Transformer models can be expressed as the sum of a linear function of the number of output tokens and a piecewise linear function of the number of prompt tokens. By profiling a small set of "configuration" queries, the coefficients of these functions can be fit using linear regression. This allows approximating the idealized runtime for arbitrary prompt and output lengths at low cost compared to exhaustive profiling. The idealized runtime can be extended to an idealized cost metric as well by incorporating the number and type of accelerators required. Using these metrics, the authors are able to conduct the first apples-to-apples analysis of efficiency vs. capability tradeoffs across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to efficiently and accurately evaluate and compare the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) that are accessible only through black-box APIs. 

Specifically, it tackles the following key challenges:

- Raw query latencies measured through black-box APIs are not inherently comparable across models, since providers can apply optimizations like caching or run models on customized hardware, which are orthogonal to model efficiency.

- Models served on shared infrastructure are susceptible to performance contention, adding noise to latency measurements. 

- Metrics like model size or FLOPs are not directly interpretable in terms of concrete metrics like latency, cost, or energy.

To address these issues, the paper proposes two new metrics:

1) The "idealized runtime", which estimates the runtime of a model on standardized hardware/software, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across models. 

2) The "denoised runtime", which removes noise from runtime measurements by profiling models and fitting a parameterized model of runtime vs. prompt/output lengths.

The key insight is that transformer runtime can be expressed as the sum of a piecewise linear function of prompt length and a linear function of output length. This allows efficient estimation of the metrics with minimal profiling.

These metrics allow more accurate and representative comparisons of model inference efficiency, providing insights into the efficiency-capability tradeoffs of different LLMs and quantification of software/hardware optimizations orthogonal to model architecture.
