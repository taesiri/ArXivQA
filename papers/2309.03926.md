# [Large-Scale Automatic Audiobook Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03926)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we automatically generate high-quality audiobooks at scale from online e-books?

The key points related to this question seem to be:

- Traditional audiobook creation using human narration or volunteers is time-consuming, expensive, and inconsistent in quality. 

- Automatic audiobook generation has historically suffered from poor text-to-speech quality and the challenge of extracting relevant text from e-books.

- This paper introduces a system to overcome these challenges by:

  - Leveraging recent advances in neural text-to-speech to improve audio quality

  - Developing methods to parse heterogeneous e-book formats to extract relevant text

  - Applying scalable computing techniques to process many books in parallel

- The proposed system is applied to create thousands of audiobooks from Project Gutenberg e-books and make them freely available.

So in summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that by combining neural TTS, scalable computing, and robust e-book parsing, it is possible to automatically create large volumes of high-quality audiobooks at low cost. The paper then presents and evaluates their proposed system for achieving this goal.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper presents a system to automatically generate high-quality audiobooks from e-books. The key method is a pipeline built using SynapseML, a scalable machine learning framework. The pipeline first clusters the heterogeneous collection of Project Gutenberg e-books using HTML features and a t-SNE visualization to identify common formats. This allows building a normalizer and parser to extract clean text. The text is fed into a neural text-to-speech system to generate speech. The text-to-speech can customize voice, speed, pitch and intonation to create an engaging audiobook. The system applies this pipeline at scale using distributed computing to convert thousands of e-books to audiobooks and contribute them openly. A live demo also allows users to create customized audiobooks. The main innovation is combining scalable computing, neural text-to-speech, and automated text parsing to mass-produce quality audiobooks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to efficiently and automatically generate high-quality audiobooks from electronic books (e-books). Some key challenges they aim to tackle include:

- The time-consuming and expensive nature of traditional audiobook production through professional narration or volunteer efforts. This limits scalability.

- The inconsistent and sometimes poor recording quality of existing volunteer-driven audiobook projects. 

- The robotic, unnatural sound of most text-to-speech systems.

- The difficulty in deciding what text to read aloud from e-books, since they contain many irrelevant parts like tables of contents, page numbers, etc.

Overall, the authors aim to develop a scalable automated system that can take e-books as input and output natural, high-quality audiobooks by overcoming these challenges. Their system uses recent advances in neural text-to-speech, emotive reading styles, and methods to parse and select relevant text from heterogeneous e-book formats. The main goal seems to be improving the accessibility and availability of audiobooks by dramatically reducing the time and cost needed to produce them.
