# [Background Noise Reduction of Attention Map for Weakly Supervised   Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using only image-level labels, Class Activation Maps (CAMs) from CNNs tend to activate only the most discriminative parts of objects.  
- Methods using Transformers can learn global features but suffer from background noise contamination in attention maps.

Proposed Solution:  
- Uses a Conformer (CNN + Transformer) backbone and proposes a method to reduce background noise in the attention maps to improve CAMs.
- Explicitly incorporates the attention-enhanced CAMs into the loss function during training to reduce background noise. 
- Adds noise based on the attention maps to the enhanced CAMs in the loss function.
- Generates pseudo-labels from the improved CAMs with reduced noise.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes inputting enhanced CAMs into the loss function to reduce background noise in attention maps.
- Achieves segmentation performance of 70.5% on PASCAL VOC 2012 validation set and 71.1% on test set, outperforming prior work.
- Obtains 45.9% performance on COCO 2014, surpassing state-of-the-art.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing background noise across different classes.

In summary, the paper tackles the issue of background noise in attention-based WSSS methods by using a Conformer backbone and explicitly incorporating attention-enhanced CAMs in the loss function during training to reduce noise. This improves CAMs and pseudo-labels, leading to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance.
