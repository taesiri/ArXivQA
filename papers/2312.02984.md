# [Diff-GO: Diffusion Goal-Oriented Communications to Achieve Ultra-High   Spectrum Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing semantic communication frameworks have limitations in flexibility, one-directional data links, and no quality of service (QoS) control. 
- Sharing constraints in diffusion models alone does not guarantee output accuracy due to the random nature of diffusion models. The transmitter has no visibility into the reconstructed output at the receiver.
- Questions remain on how to reduce communication overhead and fully leverage the flexibility of generative models.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel Diffusion-based, Goal-Oriented (Diff-GO) communication framework with local generative feedback (local-GF) and a lightweight low dimensional noise space for training diffusion models.
- Local-GF enables the transmitter to monitor semantic output quality before transmission. A hierarchical weight sharing approach minimizes overhead. 
- A new noise space mapping enables sharing a small set of weights to reconstruct the noise latent for diffusion.

Main Contributions:
- A new Diff-GO architecture with local-GF for goal-oriented QoS control and overhead reduction.
- A new diffusion model training approach with a low-dimensional quantized noise space.
- Demonstrated ultra-high spectrum efficiency and accurate image recovery using the proposed noise space and diffusion model.
- A computation for bandwidth efficiency (C4BE) framework that provides exceptional computation-bandwidth tradeoff.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel goal-oriented communication framework leveraging diffusion models and local feedback to achieve high bandwidth efficiency while maintaining quality of service for downstream tasks. A new quantized noise space also reduces communication overhead.
