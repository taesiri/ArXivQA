# [Align before Adapt: Leveraging Entity-to-Region Alignments for   Generalizable Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15619)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel "Align before Adapt" (ALT) paradigm for video action recognition that leverages alignments between visual regions and semantic entities to guide the adaptation from image representations to video representations. Specifically, it first establishes correspondences between image regions and action-related text entities using an offline text corpus and region-aware image embeddings from a token merging strategy. Then it utilizes the text embeddings of aligned entities as queries to attend to multi-frame visual features in a transformer-based video adapter, preserving semantic alignments to extract important cues. Extensive experiments show ALT achieves superior accuracy especially in few-shot scenarios while being efficient, demonstrating the benefits of reusing aligned semantics. For example, on HMDB-51 2-shot, ALT outperforms prior arts by 7.1\% with 55\% fewer GFLOPs than the best method. The paper thus provides new insights on effectively adapting image-language models to videos through explicit region-semantic alignments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an "align before adapt" paradigm for video action recognition that first establishes alignments between visual regions and semantic entities using a text corpus and then adapts a transformer-based video adapter guided by these alignments, achieving strong performance and generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel "align before adapt" paradigm for video action recognition. The main contributions are:

1. It proposes to establish entity-level correspondences between visual regions and text entities before adapting the model for video representation learning. This helps preserve the visual-language alignments from the pre-trained model and achieves better generalization ability.

2. It proposes a new transformer-based video adapter which utilizes the text embeddings of aligned entities as queries to extract important semantics from multiple frames into a video-level representation.

3. Extensive experiments show the method achieves competitive performance and superior generalization ability under various settings while requiring low computational costs. For example, in 2-shot experiments it improves previous state-of-the-art by 7.1% and 9.2% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel "align before adapt" paradigm that leverages reusable entity-level visual-language alignments to guide video representation adaptation. This shows improved performance, interpretability and transferability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "Align before Adapt" paradigm. What is the key motivation behind this paradigm compared to existing "adapt then align" approaches? How does it help with interpretability and generalization?
