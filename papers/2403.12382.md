# [Low-Trace Adaptation of Zero-shot Self-supervised Blind Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Self-supervised image denoising methods do not require clean images for training, making them more practical in real-world scenarios. However, they commonly rely on assumptions about noise characteristics, limiting applicability when those assumptions fail to hold. Additionally, self-supervised methods still lag behind their supervised counterparts that leverage clean data. This work aims to bridge that performance gap without requiring noise model assumptions.

Method:
The key insight is that adding a trace constraint term to the loss function reduces optimization objective disparity between self-supervised and supervised methods. The trace term captures combined scaling effects in the feature space. Constraining the trace enables spatial displacements of features while preserving overall spatial scale during mapping.

The proposed LoTA-N2N (Low-trace Adaptation Noise2Noise) employs two-phase training. First is MSE-based pretraining to establish initial denoising ability. Second is fine-tuning where a trace-constrained loss supplements training beyond the MSE baseline. Additional mutual learning and residual learning components further improve performance.

Evaluated on natural, medical, and biological image datasets under varying noise types and levels, LoTA-N2N achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising capability. It also reduces computation time versus prior self-supervised methods. 

Contributions:
1) Introduces trace-constrained loss that removes reliance on noise model assumptions, enhancing adaptability.

2) Proposes LoTA-N2N model with two-phase training strategy utilizing trace-constrained loss to improve self-supervised learning.

3) Surpasses prior self-supervised methods across image datasets while lowering computational costs.

4) Demonstrates practical real-world viability by not necessitating clean data or noise distribution knowledge.
