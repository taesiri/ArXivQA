# [Decoupling SQL Query Hardness Parsing for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper documents Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template for preparing journal articles. The template is available in two formats - cas-sc.cls for single column and cas-dc.cls for double column layouts. 

The paper first introduces the usage and compatibility of the CAS templates. It can be used with Elsevier's electronic submission system as well as for separate submissions.

It then covers the front matter in detail, including elements like the title, authors, affiliations, abstract, keywords etc. Various additional elements like title marks, author marks, non-numbered notes, corresponding author details etc. are also documented. Figures demonstrating single and double column output with the class files are included.

The main matter is then covered, with a focus on elements like tables, figures, theorems, proofs, lists etc. The CAS class allows for easy customization and formatting of these elements. Special enumerate lists with advanced formatting options are also enabled. 

Finally, the biography and bibliographic facilities are documented. The CAS templates come with special .bst files for formatted references in two main styles - numeric and name/year. The bibliographies and citations can be formatted according to journal requirements by using these.

In summary, the paper thoroughly documents the features and usage of the CAS LaTeX templates for preparing journal articles in Elsevier's workflow. Both beginner and advanced features are covered through numerous examples. The templates allow authors to prepare high quality articles that conform to submission standards.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper documents Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template, which provides class files and templates for typesetting journal articles to be submitted to Elsevier journals, supporting one-column (cas-sc.cls) and two-column (cas-dc.cls) layouts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides documentation for Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template. The main contributions are:

1) Explains the usage of the cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls class files for formatting journal articles to be submitted to Elsevier journals.

2) Documents various front matter commands like \title, \author, \tnotemark, \tnotetext, \fnmark, \fntext, etc. for specifying the article title, authors, and author notes.

3) Shows how to format the abstract and keywords using the abstract and keywords environments. 

4) Explains how to format tables, figures, theorems, proofs, lists, etc. in the main text.

5) Provides information about specifying author biographies and author contributions using \bio and \credit commands. 

6) Discusses the recommended BibTeX styles and how to format the bibliography citations.

In summary, it is a guide for authors to prepare manuscripts for submission to Elsevier journals using the CAS LaTeX template.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- LaTeX - The document preparation system used to typeset the paper.

- Elsevier Ltd - The publisher mentioned whose class files (cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls) are used in the template. 

- Document class - Referred to the LaTeX class files that define the layout and styling of the template.

- Template - The cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls LaTeX template files that facilitate formatting journal articles.

- Front matter - The introductory material of an article consisting of the title, author names and affiliations, abstract, keywords, etc.

- Article sections - The paper discusses the major sections of a journal article like the front matter, main text, bibliography etc.

- Figures and tables - The template allows inclusion of floats like figures, tables and textboxes.

- Theorems - There is discussion of environments for stating theorems, definitions and proofs.

- Bibliographic styles - The paper recommends some .bst files for formatting the list of references.

In summary, the key terms have to do with LaTeX, typesetting templates, journal article structure and bibliographic formatting which is what the paper is mainly about.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes LaTeX templates for CAS journals. What are some of the key benefits of using these specific templates compared to creating documents from scratch? How much time/effort can they save in formatting and ensuring compliance to submission guidelines?

2) The paper mentions two recommended bibliography styles - model1-num-names.bst and cas-model2-names.bst. What are the main differences between these two styles in how they handle formatting the reference list and citations? When would you pick one over the other?

3) The documentation provides examples of specifying various elements like title, author names, affiliation details etc. What are some of the more complex scenarios that may need additional customization or manipulation when specifying these fields? 

4) The paper allows long abstracts spanning multiple pages. What are some tips to effectively format a clear, concise abstract while also accommodating space for equations/special symbols if absolutely necessary?

5) The CAS templates provide easy hooks to format environments like theorems, definitions etc. What are some ways these could be utilized to ensure uniform styling when discussing key concepts in a paper?

6) The documentation talks about sectioning, cross-references, appendices etc. What recommendations would you have for structuring a complex, multi-part paper leveraging these elements?

7) The front matter handles various author notes and attribution marks like footnotes, correspondence details etc. When should one use the nonumnote vs the regular footnote? What are some strategies to avoid confusing the reader with too many marks?

8) The template allows specifying custom biographies for authors. In what scenarios would you recommend highlighting a customized author biography vs just name/affiliation details? What content is appropriate in an author bio vs paper content?

9) The paper provides a credit statement to specify author contributions. Are there any best practices around how specific/verbose this statement should be? How would you handle disputes around effort attribution? 

10) The paper does not discuss in detail submission specifics around PDF generation, metadata settings etc. What are some important guidelines authors should know when submitting a camera-ready PDF to CAS publications?
