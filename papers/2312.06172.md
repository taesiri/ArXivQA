## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper documents Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template, which provides class files (cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls) and template files for formatting journal articles to be submitted through Elsevier's publication system. The cas-sc class is for single-column layouts while the cas-dc class is for two-column layouts. The template allows the author to format various front matter elements like the title, authors, affiliations, abstract, keywords, etc. It supports including figures, tables, theorems, proofs, enumerated lists, and bibliographies. The template also allows specifying author contribution statements and biographies. For the bibliography, two reference models are recommended: model1-num-names.bst and cas-model2-names.bst, for formatted numbered and author-year reference styles respectively. Overall, the template provides an efficient way to prepare manuscripts for submission to Elsevier CAS journals.
