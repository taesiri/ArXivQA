# [Distilling Knowledge from Reader to Retriever for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04584)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to learn an effective retriever model for downstream natural language processing tasks like question answering, without requiring strong supervision in the form of query-document pairs for training. 

The key hypothesis is that the attention scores from a reader model can serve as a good proxy for document relevance, and thus can be used to provide supervisory signal to train the retriever model in a student-teacher framework inspired by knowledge distillation. Specifically, the paper proposes using the reader's cross-attention scores over retrieved documents as synthetic labels to train the retriever to reproduce a similar ranking of document relevance for a given query.

In summary, the central research question is how to train a high-quality neural retriever model without explicit query-document supervision, with the core hypothesis being that reader attention can be distilled into the retriever as a relevance signal. The paper aims to validate this hypothesis experimentally on question answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a technique to learn retriever models for downstream tasks without requiring annotated pairs of queries and documents. The key ideas are:

- Using attention scores from a reader model as a proxy for document relevance. Specifically, they aggregate the cross-attention scores from a sequence-to-sequence reader model to obtain synthetic labels indicating the relevance of documents to a query. 

- Proposing an iterative training procedure inspired by knowledge distillation, where the reader model produces targets used to train the retriever model. The reader and retriever are trained alternately in this loop.

- Evaluating the approach on question answering tasks and showing it achieves state-of-the-art results without needing strong supervision for retrieving relevant documents.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be presenting a method to learn an information retrieval module for downstream NLP tasks without query-document relevance labels, by instead leveraging signals from a reader model's attention via an iterative distillation-style training approach. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated for open-domain question answering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a technique to train an information retrieval module for question answering without requiring annotated query-document pairs, by using a reader model's attention scores to provide synthetic labels for distilling knowledge into the retriever model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in open-domain question answering:

- The main novelty of this paper is using knowledge distillation to train a retriever without needing query-document pairs as supervision. This is an interesting alternative to other unsupervised retrieval training methods like inverse cloze and masked language modeling. 

- For the reader model, the authors use the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, which has shown strong results on open-domain QA. This builds on other work using seq2seq models like BERT for reading comprehension.

- For retrieval, they use a bi-encoder with BERT embeddings, similar to the Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) system. Their iterative training procedure improves over DPR, demonstrating the benefits of distilling the reader's attention.

- Their results improve over previous state-of-the-art like DPR and REALM on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. This is impressive given their method does not require any query-document supervision.

- Compared to other recent knowledge distillation approaches for open-domain QA like RAG and ANCE, this method distills from the reader's attention directly, rather than distilling a cross-encoder reranker. The benefits of the different distillation strategies could be analyzed further.

- For retrieval evaluation, they analyze both document recall metrics and end-task QA accuracy. Connectingretrieval performance to end-task impact is an important contribution.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on unsupervised training of retrievers, advancing state-of-the-art in open-domain QA. The knowledge distillation approach is novel and well-motivated. More analysis could be done to understand exactly what signals the reader's attention provides the retriever.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring better pre-training strategies for the retriever module, such as using the inverse cloze task or other unsupervised objectives. The authors note that the quality of the initial passage representations has a big impact on the final performance.

- Investigating improved scoring functions and architectures for the retriever model beyond the basic bi-encoder dot product. The authors mention that joint interactions between query and documents could be beneficial.

- Applying the proposed distillation training approach to other information retrieval tasks beyond open-domain QA, such as ad-hoc retrieval or fact checking. The method does not rely on QA-specific heuristics.

- Evaluating the impact of re-initializing the retriever weights between distillation iterations, instead of continuous training. The authors did not experiment with this.

- Exploring whether the reader's attention scores provide a better relevance signal than scores based on the predicted answer span. The authors directly used the attention scores.

- Examining if better reader architectures, beyond the sequence-to-sequence model used here, can provide improved relevance signals for distillation.

- Studying the sample efficiency and scalability of the approach to much larger datasets and knowledge sources. The experiments used established benchmarks.

In summary, the main directions are enhancing the retriever pre-training and model, applying the method to other tasks, and further analysis of the reader-to-retriever distillation approach itself.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a technique to learn retriever models for downstream tasks like open-domain question answering, without requiring annotated pairs of queries and documents for supervision. The approach is inspired by knowledge distillation, using a reader model to obtain synthetic labels to train the retriever. Specifically, they use a sequence-to-sequence model as the reader, and leverage the attention scores over the input documents as relevance measures to create targets for training the retriever. The retriever is trained to reproduce the ranking of documents based on the attention scores. The method involves iteratively training the reader and retriever, with the reader providing updated relevance targets for the retriever at each iteration. They evaluate the approach on question answering, obtaining state-of-the-art results on TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, and NarrativeQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that competitive retriever models can be learned without strong supervision by distilling knowledge from a reader model in this manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a technique to learn retriever models for downstream tasks without requiring annotated pairs of query and documents. The approach is inspired by knowledge distillation, where a student retriever model is trained to mimic a teacher reader model. Specifically, a sequence-to-sequence reader model is used to obtain relevance scores for passages based on its cross-attention activations when processing query-passage inputs. These relevance scores are then used as synthetic labels to train the retriever model to rank passages accordingly. 

The method is evaluated on open-domain question answering tasks using TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, and NarrativeQA datasets. Through an iterative training procedure, where the reader and retriever are alternately trained, the model is able to achieve state-of-the-art results without any query-document supervision. Ablation studies analyze different loss functions and attention aggregation schemes. Overall, the results demonstrate that reader attention can be effectively distilled into a retriever model for improving information retrieval for question answering. The approach provides a way to learn retrievers without labeled data, opening up possibilities for application to new tasks and datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method to train an information retrieval module for downstream natural language processing tasks, without requiring annotated query-document pairs. The approach uses two models - a retriever model that selects relevant documents from a large corpus, and a reader model that processes the retrieved documents to solve the task. 

The key idea is to use the reader model's attention scores over the input documents as a signal to train the retriever model. Specifically, the attention scores from the reader are aggregated and used as soft targets to train the retriever to reproduce a similar ranking of document relevance. This approach is inspired by knowledge distillation, with the reader model acting as the teacher and the retriever model as the student.

The reader model is a sequence-to-sequence architecture that encodes the question and retrieved documents jointly. The retriever model is a bi-encoder that independently embeds the question and documents using BERT. The training procedure is iterative - the reader is trained on retrieved documents, then the retriever is trained to match the reader's document relevance scores.

Experiments on question answering tasks show this approach achieves state-of-the-art results without needing query-document pairs for supervision. The key technique is using reader attention to transfer the document relevance signal to the retriever.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, the paper is addressing the problem of training an information retrieval system, specifically a retriever model, without requiring strong supervision in the form of query-document pairs. The key questions it aims to tackle are:

1) How can we train a neural retriever model without having explicit labels indicating which documents are relevant for a given query? 

2) Can we leverage an existing reader model that processes retrieved documents to generate synthetic training signal for the retriever?

3) What training objective and architecture works best for learning the retriever using this distillation process?

Specifically, the paper proposes using the attention scores from a reader model as a proxy for document relevance, and training the retriever to match these attention scores. This allows them to iteratively improve the retriever without needing query-document pairs. The main focus is on evaluating this distillation approach for training retrievers for open-domain question answering.

In summary, the key problem is removing the need for explicit query-document labels when training neural retrieval models, which they address by distilling relevance knowledge from a reader model's attention. Their experiments demonstrate this allows training an effective retriever for question answering without strong supervision.
