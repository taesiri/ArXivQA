# [Neuromorphic force-control in an industrial task: validating energy and   latency benefits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08928)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- As robots become more intelligent, optimizing their energy consumption is critical for sustainability. CPUs/GPUs use too much power for complex edge robotics applications.  
- Neuromorphic hardware can provide major improvements in energy efficiency and latency based on brain-inspired neural architectures, but benefits have not yet been shown in real-world robotic settings.

Proposed Solution:
- Train a spiking neural network (SNN) with reinforcement learning in simulation to do force-control for a peg-in-hole insertion task with an industrial robot arm.
- Port trained SNN policy to Loihi neuromorphic chip connected to real KUKA arm. 
- Use domain randomization and system ID to address sim2real gap.

Contributions:
- First complex real-world robotic task fully controlled by a neuromorphic chip, enabling direct energy/latency measurements.
- Energy use shown to be in milliwatt range - two orders of magnitude less than optimized edge hardware.
- Latency competitive with CPU/GPU, validating expected neuromorphic benefits.
- First force-torque feedback sensing for neurorobotic system.
- Framework and techniques to facilitate future neurorobotics research.

In summary, this work shows the maturity of neuromorphic hardware and its ability to efficiently handle complex robotic tasks. The energy and latency benefits versus traditional hardware are validated through measurements from a real-world non-trivial use case. This helps enable the next generation of intelligent and sustainable robotics.
