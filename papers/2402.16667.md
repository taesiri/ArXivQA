# [RepoAgent: An LLM-Powered Open-Source Framework for Repository-level   Code Documentation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Maintaining up-to-date code documentation is crucial for program comprehension but also time-consuming. Prior automatic documentation methods have limitations in: (1) Poor summarization due to focusing on isolated code snippets rather than repository-level context; (2) Inadequate guidance on code usage; (3) Lack of timely updates to align with code changes.

Proposed Solution - RepoAgent:  
The paper proposes RepoAgent, an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) based framework to automatically generate, maintain and update repository-level code documentation. RepoAgent has three key stages:

1. Global Structure Analysis: Parses metadata and contextual relationships from code to enable understanding functional semantics. Constructs a project tree and Directed Acyclic Graph.

2. Documentation Generation: Designed prompt guides LLM to generate documentation with structure, detailed descriptions, usage guidance and examples. Follows topological order during generation.

3. Documentation Update: Utilizes Git tools to automatically track code changes and update relevant documentation sections, keeping docs synchronized.

Main Contributions:

- First LLM-based solution for automated repository-level code documentation generation.
- Comprehensive documentation with structure, descriptions, usage notes and input/output examples. 
- Seamless integration with Git for real-time documentation updates aligned with code changes.
- Qualitative and quantitative evaluation showing RepoAgent generates high quality documentation comparable to human-authored.

In summary, RepoAgent effectively addresses limitations of prior documentation methods via an LLM-powered solution that automatically generates, maintains and updates repository-level code documentation of practical utility comparable to human standards.
