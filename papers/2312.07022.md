## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new defense method called EdgePruner to mitigate the effects of poisoning attacks on graph contrastive learning (GCL). The key idea is to prune adversarial edges from poisoned graphs that contribute the most to minimizing the contrastive loss, thereby sanitizing the graphs. The method formulates the edge pruning as an optimization problem to find the optimal pruned graph that yields the minimum contrastive loss. To help determine adversarial edges more accurately, EdgePruner also utilizes feature similarity between connected nodes since attacks tend to connect dissimilar nodes. Experiments across six datasets demonstrate that EdgePruner can effectively eliminate detrimental impacts of poisoned graphs, improving node classification accuracy over state-of-the-art methods by up to 5.55%. The results also show the usefulness of leveraging feature similarity information. Overall, by focusing on pruning adversarial edges, EdgePruner provides a simple yet effective graph sanitization defense for GCL against poisoning attacks without relying on node labels. The feasibility of such pruning is validated, motivating further research into more advanced sanitization techniques.
