# [RetGen: A Joint framework for Retrieval and Grounded Text Generation   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06597)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be:

How can we develop a framework to improve text generation models by grounding them in relevant external documents, without requiring explicit document-text pairs for training?

The key points are:

- Text generation models like GPT-3 can produce fluent text but often suffer from hallucinating facts or being unfaithful to real-world knowledge. 

- Grounding text generation in external documents (like Wikipedia) could help address these issues, but typically requires parallel data of documents mapped to target text.

- This paper proposes a framework called RetGen that jointly trains a retriever and generator to optimize a text generation objective, without needing explicit document-text pairs.

- The retriever learns to select relevant documents for a given context based on the generator's language modeling signal. 

- The generator learns to incorporate information from multiple retrieved documents in a mixture-of-experts approach.

- Experiments on Reddit conversations and arXiv abstracts show improvements in text relevance, factuality, and use of external information compared to baseline models.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that jointly training the retriever and generator in an end-to-end fashion, using only a non-parallel text corpus, can improve the grounding and factual accuracy of text generation systems. The proposed RetGen framework aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a joint training framework called RetGen to simultaneously optimize a dense passage retriever and a knowledge-grounded text generator in an end-to-end fashion. This allows the retriever and generator to work synergistically to produce more informative and relevant text.

- Showing that the retriever can be optimized using the language modeling signals from the generator, which alleviates the need for parallel data of context-document pairs for training.

- Developing a mixture-of-experts style decoder that can leverage multiple retrieved documents to generate text in a multi-document fashion. This allows flexible incorporation of external information.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of RetGen on two datasets - Reddit for dialog response generation and arXiv for scientific text generation. Results show improvements over baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the joint training framework RetGen to enable better grounded text generation by synergistically optimizing the retriever and generator components. A key advantage is the ability to train without parallel data of context and reference documents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents a joint training framework for grounded text generation that combines a dense passage retriever with a knowledge-grounded text generator. This differs from most prior work that either retrieves then edits/rewrites existing text, or relies on having annotated ground truth documents paired with the context during training. 

- The key novelty is the end-to-end training approach that uses the language modeling objective to optimize both the retriever and generator components. This alleviates the need for scarce parallel data of context-document pairs for training. The retriever learns to find documents useful for generation without explicit annotations.

- The framework is evaluated on both dialogue and prose generation tasks, demonstrating broader applicability beyond just conversational agents. The experiments show improvements over baseline transformer models and other retriever-generator models like RAG.

- The mixture-of-experts decoding strategy for multi-document grounding is similar to recent work like FiD, but doesn't require retraining the generator on multiple documents. The use of mutual information maximization for reranking is also a known technique adopted here.

- Overall, the joint training approach to obviate the need for annotated grounding data is novel. The results demonstrate that simultaneously optimizing the retriever and generator is mutually beneficial. The framework is general purpose and could likely be adapted to other text generation tasks needing external grounding.

In summary, the key differentiation from prior work is the joint training technique to optimize retrieval and grounding without parallel data. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both conversational and prose generation benchmarks using this approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to further improve the accuracy and reduce the hallucinations of the generated text. The paper notes some remaining issues with incorrect or irrelevant information being incorporated from retrieved documents. Improving the faithfulness and factuality of the generated text is highlighted as an important direction.

- Incorporating additional objectives beyond language modeling that encourage factual correctness, such as Question Answering and cloze-style tasks. The authors suggest these could help further improve the fidelity of the generated text.

- Exploring the use of contrastive learning within the proposed joint training framework. The authors suggest this could potentially serve as a general pre-training approach for grounded text generation.

- Applying the approach to additional datasets and domains beyond Reddit conversations and Arxiv papers. Showing the generality and scalability of the framework is noted as valuable future work.

- Mitigating potential negative societal impacts such as bias, toxicity or unfairness in the trained models. The authors note the data likely contains some problematic content that requires more analysis.

- Improving the retriever to return more relevant documents and reduce retrieval errors. This could involve techniques like query reformulation or retrieval over multiple rounds.

- Developing more accurate automatic evaluation metrics, as human evaluation was found to be challenging and noisy. The authors suggest this is an important open problem as systems improve.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving accuracy, fidelity and fairness of the grounded text, scaling and generalizing the approach, and developing better evaluation methods. The authors propose several interesting next steps to build on their joint training framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called RetGen for joint training of a dense passage retriever and a grounded text generator. RetGen aims to improve the informativeness and factual correctness of generated text by retrieving relevant reference documents and incorporating key information from them during generation. The framework has two main components - a dense retriever based on maximum inner product search that retrieves the top-K most relevant documents for a given context, and a transformer-based grounded text generator that takes the context and retrieved documents as input to generate the follow-on text. The generator uses a Mixture-of-Experts approach to attend to information from multiple documents. 

A key advantage of RetGen is that it does not require parallel data with ground-truth reference documents for training. Instead, it uses the language modeling objective to directly optimize both the retriever and generator parameters in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on Reddit conversations and arXiv paper abstracts demonstrate improvements in relevance of retrieved documents and informativeness of generated text, as validated by both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The framework alleviates the need for annotated grounding data and enables training grounded text generation models on any target corpus. Limitations include potential retrieval of irrelevant documents and failure to incorporate correct information from retrieved content. Overall, RetGen presents a promising approach for more effective information-grounded natural language generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new framework called RetGen for grounded text generation. The framework consists of two main components: a dense passage retriever and a knowledge-grounded text generator. 

The key idea is to jointly train the retriever and generator end-to-end to enable them to work together synergistically. The retriever learns to retrieve the most useful documents to help the generator produce more informative and grounded text. The generator learns to selectively attend to and summarize the key information from multiple retrieved documents. A key advantage is that this framework does not require parallel data of document-response pairs for training like most prior grounded generation models. Experiments on Reddit conversations and arXiv papers demonstrate improvements in relevance, grounding, and factuality of generated text over baselines. The framework alleviates common issues like hallucination in open-domain chatbots. Limitations include potential retrieval of irrelevant documents and missing key facts from retrieved documents. Overall, the joint training approach enables more effective information grounding without needing annotated data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called RetGen for grounded text generation. RetGen has two main components - a dense document retriever and a knowledge-grounded text generator. During training, the model is jointly optimized to maximize the likelihood of the target text y given the source context x and a large external document set Z. Since enumerating over all possible documents z in Z is intractable, the retriever is used to narrow down the search space and retrieve the top K most relevant documents to x. These documents are then fed individually into the grounded text generator along with x to compute document-specific likelihoods p(y|x,z_k). The final training loss combines the generator likelihoods weighted by the retriever probabilities p(z_k|x). Optimizing this joint objective enables the retriever to extract documents most useful for generation, while the generator learns to attend to and digest information from multiple retrieved documents. During inference, the top K documents are retrieved and fed into an ensemble of K grounded generator copies in parallel. The individual distributions are assembled via mixture-of-experts to produce the final output. The model is end-to-end trainable and does not require parallel data of (x, y, z) triples. Experiments on Reddit conversations and arXiv abstracts demonstrate improved performance over baselines.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a joint training framework called RetGen that trains a dense passage retriever and knowledge-grounded text generator together, alleviating the need for parallel data and enabling the retriever and generator to work synergistically to produce more informative and grounded text.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper is addressing the challenge of generating high-quality text that incorporates relevant external information, without relying on parallel data where documents are explicitly provided for each context. The key problems it aims to tackle are:

- Large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 can generate fluent text but often hallucinate facts or are not grounded in real-world knowledge. 

- Existing grounded text generation models require parallel data with context-document pairs for training, which is rarely available.

- There is a need for models that can leverage large document collections to produce informative and factual text, without explicit grounding supervision.

To address this, the paper proposes a framework called RetGen that jointly trains a document retriever and knowledge-grounded text generator to enable generating text by retrieving and summarizing relevant reference documents. The key ideas are:

- Jointly optimize retriever and generator to retrieve documents useful for generation, without need for parallel data.

- Generator uses a mixture-of-experts approach to attend to multiple retrieved docs.

- Apply mutual information maximization to improve grounding.

So in summary, it aims to improve the informativeness and factual correctness in text generation by facilitating retrieval and grounding in external knowledge, in an end-to-end trainable fashion without parallel data. The problems are the hallucination issue in language models and the data constraint for grounded generation.
