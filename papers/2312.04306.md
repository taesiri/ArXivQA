## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the nerblackbox library proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that nerblackbox provides "fine-grained control over all sorts of low-level parameters". What are some examples of low-level parameters that can be customized in nerblackbox?

2. One of the aims of nerblackbox is to simplify the usage of transformer-based NER models. What are some key technical challenges and complications in using such models that nerblackbox helps overcome?

3. The paper talks about nerblackbox's compatibility with the transformers library. In what ways is nerblackbox built on top of transformers? What transformers functionality is reused and how?  

4. What are some of the differences in annotation schemes for NER datasets? How does nerblackbox handle translating between different schemes during training?

5. The paper discusses dataset integration from different sources like HuggingFace and annotation tools. What are some examples of formatting differences between datasets that nerblackbox handles automatically?

6. How does the learning rate scheduling used by default in nerblackbox training adapt to different dataset sizes? What are the specific methods and heuristics used?

7. What are some use cases where a user might want to use only a subset of the available training data in nerblackbox? What functionality supports this?

8. The paper mentions detailed training and evaluation results are saved via MLflow and TensorBoard. What specific metrics, plots or other information would be available there and how could they be used?

9. What approaches does nerblackbox provide to quantify and control for the statistical uncertainty during training and evaluation?
