## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dense text retrieval approach based on pretrained language models (PLMs). PLMs have shown excellent capabilities in modeling and representing semantics of text. The key idea is to map both queries and texts into dense vector representations using PLMs, such that relevance can be measured by the similarity between the latent embeddings. This survey reviews recent advances on PLM-based dense retrieval models from four aspects: architecture, training, indexing, and integration. For architecture, it discusses bi-encoder and cross-encoder variants. For training, it focuses on techniques like negative sampling, data augmentation, and pretraining strategies. For indexing, it introduces approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms to enable efficient retrieval in the latent space. For integration, it examines methods to optimize the first-stage retriever with subsequent rerankers. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive reference focused on major progress and practical techniques for building capable dense retrieval systems. Useful resources including paper collection, code repositories, and toolkits are provided to support the survey.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a survey on dense text retrieval based on pretrained language models (PLMs). Dense retrieval refers to using dense vector representations of queries and texts for semantic matching, instead of relying on lexical matching like traditional sparse retrieval models. The survey focuses on reviewing the recent progress of PLM-based dense retrieval models. 

The survey organizes the related work into four main aspects: architecture, training, indexing, and integration. For architecture, it discusses using PLMs in bi-encoder and cross-encoder architectures for relevance matching. For training, it reviews techniques like negative sampling, data augmentation, and pretraining to optimize dense retrievers. For indexing, it introduces approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms to enable efficient search in the latent dense vector space. For integration, it discusses optimizing the retrieval pipeline with retriever and reranker modules. The survey also covers advanced topics like zero-shot retrieval, query robustness, model based retrieval, and retrieval augmented language models. It provides a comprehensive reference focused on the major techniques for building PLM-based dense retrieval systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a dense passage retrieval method based on pretrained language models. The key points are:

1. It uses a bi-encoder architecture consisting of two Transformer encoders to independently encode the query and the passage into dense vectors. 

2. It is initialized with a pretrained BERT model and fine-tuned on the passage ranking task. The training objective is to maximize the dot product between positive query-passage pairs while minimizing it for negative pairs. Hard negatives are mined using BM25 retrieval during training.

3. Knowledge distillation from a more powerful cross-encoder teacher model is used to improve the bi-encoder. The teacher generates soft labels that provide more informative training signal.

4. To enable efficient retrieval from a large corpus, approximate nearest neighbor search with maximum inner product search is utilized. The passages are indexed offline using their encoded vectors. At query time, the query vector is used to retrieve approximate nearest passages efficiently.

5. Experiments on passage ranking datasets show the bi-encoder model outperforms previous sparse and dense baselines. The knowledge distillation further improves performance. The efficient indexing also allows scaling to corpora with tens of millions of passages.

In summary, it presents an effective approach for dense passage retrieval based on pretrained Transformer models like BERT, with techniques like hard negative mining, distillation, and maximum inner product search to achieve strong performance.
