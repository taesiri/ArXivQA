## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a dense passage retrieval method based on pretrained language models. The key points are:

1. It uses a bi-encoder architecture consisting of two Transformer encoders to independently encode the query and the passage into dense vectors. 

2. It is initialized with a pretrained BERT model and fine-tuned on the passage ranking task. The training objective is to maximize the dot product between positive query-passage pairs while minimizing it for negative pairs. Hard negatives are mined using BM25 retrieval during training.

3. Knowledge distillation from a more powerful cross-encoder teacher model is used to improve the bi-encoder. The teacher generates soft labels that provide more informative training signal.

4. To enable efficient retrieval from a large corpus, approximate nearest neighbor search with maximum inner product search is utilized. The passages are indexed offline using their encoded vectors. At query time, the query vector is used to retrieve approximate nearest passages efficiently.

5. Experiments on passage ranking datasets show the bi-encoder model outperforms previous sparse and dense baselines. The knowledge distillation further improves performance. The efficient indexing also allows scaling to corpora with tens of millions of passages.

In summary, it presents an effective approach for dense passage retrieval based on pretrained Transformer models like BERT, with techniques like hard negative mining, distillation, and maximum inner product search to achieve strong performance.
