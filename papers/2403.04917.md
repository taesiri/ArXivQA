# [A Mixed-Integer Conic Program for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman   Problem based on a Graph of Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP). This is a generalization of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where instead of visiting static targets, the aim is to visit a set of targets moving along predefined trajectories within assigned time windows.

- The objective is to find the shortest feasible tour for an agent that starts from a depot, visits each moving target exactly once within its time window, and returns to the depot. This problem is NP-hard.

Proposed Solution:  
- The key idea is that when targets move along lines at constant velocities, their trajectories over their time windows form line segments in the space-time coordinate system. These line segments are convex sets.

- This allows formulating the MT-TSP as finding the shortest path in a graph of convex sets, subject to additional speed constraints. The proposed mixed integer conic program (MICP-GCS) leverages this graph of convex sets formulation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new, more efficient MICP formulation for a variant of the MT-TSP based on modeling target trajectories as convex sets 

- Proof of validity showing the new MICP-GCS yields optimal MT-TSP tours

- Experiments on MT-TSP instances with up to 20 targets. MICP-GCS has significantly better runtimes (up to 100x faster) and optimality gaps (60% tighter) compared to state-of-the-art MICP.

- Shows the convex relaxation of MICP-GCS provides much tighter lower bounds for the MT-TSP than the baseline MICP formulation.

In summary, the paper presents a more scalable approach for solving a variant of the MT-TSP by exploiting the structure of target trajectories. The proposed MICP-GCS formulation outperforms the baseline MICP in terms of runtime, optimality gap and bound tightness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new mixed integer conic program formulation based on modeling target trajectories as convex sets in space-time, proves its validity, and shows through computational experiments that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art formulation for a variant of the traveling salesman problem with moving targets that move along straight lines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new formulation called MICP-GCS (Mixed Integer Conic Program based on the Graph of Convex Sets) to solve a variant of the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem where the targets move along lines with constant speeds. The key ideas behind MICP-GCS are:

1) Representing the trajectory segments of each target within their time windows as convex sets in the space-time coordinate system. 

2) Formulating the problem as finding the shortest path in a graph of these convex sets.

The paper proves the validity of MICP-GCS and shows through computational experiments that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art formulation (a mixed integer SOCP) in terms of solution time and optimality gap. Specifically, MICP-GCS runs up to two orders of magnitude faster and provides optimality gap improvements of 40-60% in some cases. The paper also demonstrates that MICP-GCS has a much stronger convex relaxation, which can be used to get good lower bounds on the optimal solution quickly.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel MICP-GCS formulation that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in exactly solving a variant of the MT-TSP problem.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key idea behind the proposed GCS-based MICP is that when targets move along lines, their trajectories become convex sets in the space-time coordinate system. Can you explain in detail how representing the trajectories as convex sets enables formulating the MT-TSP as finding shortest paths in a graph of convex sets?

2. The proposed GCS-based MICP replaces the big-M constraints in the baseline MICP with perspective constraints on the convex sets. What is the intuition behind using perspective constraints and how do they help strengthen the formulation? 

3. The flow conservation constraints in the GCS-based MICP couple the visiting times and binary edge variables. Explain the purpose of such coupling and how it ensures consistency between the edge selections and visiting times.

4. The proof of validity relies on showing an equivalence between the GCS-based MICP and biconvex formulation. Can you walk through the key steps in this proof and highlight the main arguments?

5. The convex relaxation of the GCS-based MICP provides much tighter lower bounds compared to relaxing the baseline MICP. What causes the baseline relaxation to be weak and how does the GCS-based formulation avoid this issue?

6. The performance experiments vary parameters like number of targets, time windows, and agent speed. What trends do you observe in the results as these parameters are changed? Can you provide some insight into these trends?

7. As the number of targets and time window durations increase, what specifically causes the baseline MICP to struggle in terms of optimality gap and runtime? How does the GCS-based formulation scale better?

8. The recovery of the optimal tour relies on choosing visited points using the edge variables and flows. Explain this recovery procedure and why it works. 

9. How do you choose the time windows to generate valid instances? What is the intuition behind the method used?

10. The lower bounds from the convex relaxation get weaker as the number of targets and time windows increase. What causes this behavior and how can the relaxation be potentially strengthened?
