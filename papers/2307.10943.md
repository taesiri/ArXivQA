# [Proxy Anchor-based Unsupervised Learning for Continuous Generalized   Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question is how to perform novel category discovery in a continual learning setting, without requiring prior knowledge about the number/proportion of novel categories or samples. The main hypothesis is that by using a combination of proxy anchors, noisy label learning, and an exemplar-based approach, it is possible to incrementally discover novel categories in unlabeled data in a more realistic scenario.Specifically, the key elements of their approach are:- Using proxy anchors to inherit discriminative features of old categories and split unlabeled data into old vs novel sets.- Adopting noisy label learning to refine the split by training a classifier on the initial split results. - Generating representative category vectors using the proxy anchors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.The central hypothesis is that this approach will outperform prior methods and discover novel categories in a continuous generalized setting without needing prior knowledge about the data. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on several fine-grained benchmark datasets.In summary, the key research question is how to tackle the challenging problem of incremental novel category discovery without strong assumptions, and the main hypothesis is that their proposed proxy anchor and noisy label learning framework can achieve this. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing a new scenario called Continuous Generalized novel Category Discovery (CGCD) that is more representative of real-world incremental learning scenarios. It does not assume disjoint labeled and unlabeled sets or require prior knowledge about the number/proportion of novel categories.2. Proposing a novel unsupervised learning method for CGCD that involves:- Using proxy anchors to split unlabeled data into old and novel categories- Assigning pseudo-labels to the split data using previous model predictions and clustering- Mitigating catastrophic forgetting with a proxy anchor based exemplar 3. Demonstrating superior performance to prior methods on CGCD without requiring any prior knowledge about the unlabeled data. The method shows improved novel category discovery and forgetting mitigation on fine-grained datasets.4. Presenting analyses like the effectiveness of the proposed data splitting and exemplar methods through ablation studies. The method is shown to be robust to different ratios of known/novel categories.In summary, the key contribution appears to be introducing a more realistic yet challenging scenario for novel class discovery, and developing an unsupervised approach to address it effectively without prior knowledge about the unlabeled data. The proxy anchor based techniques for splitting data and generating representative exemplars seem to be important components of the proposed method.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning approach for incremental novel category discovery on unlabeled joint datasets without requiring prior knowledge about the number/proportion of novel categories, using proxy anchors for splitting and clustering data into old and new classes and preventing catastrophic forgetting.
