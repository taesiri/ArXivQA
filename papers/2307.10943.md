# [Proxy Anchor-based Unsupervised Learning for Continuous Generalized   Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question is how to perform novel category discovery in a continual learning setting, without requiring prior knowledge about the number/proportion of novel categories or samples. The main hypothesis is that by using a combination of proxy anchors, noisy label learning, and an exemplar-based approach, it is possible to incrementally discover novel categories in unlabeled data in a more realistic scenario.Specifically, the key elements of their approach are:- Using proxy anchors to inherit discriminative features of old categories and split unlabeled data into old vs novel sets.- Adopting noisy label learning to refine the split by training a classifier on the initial split results. - Generating representative category vectors using the proxy anchors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.The central hypothesis is that this approach will outperform prior methods and discover novel categories in a continuous generalized setting without needing prior knowledge about the data. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on several fine-grained benchmark datasets.In summary, the key research question is how to tackle the challenging problem of incremental novel category discovery without strong assumptions, and the main hypothesis is that their proposed proxy anchor and noisy label learning framework can achieve this. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing a new scenario called Continuous Generalized novel Category Discovery (CGCD) that is more representative of real-world incremental learning scenarios. It does not assume disjoint labeled and unlabeled sets or require prior knowledge about the number/proportion of novel categories.2. Proposing a novel unsupervised learning method for CGCD that involves:- Using proxy anchors to split unlabeled data into old and novel categories- Assigning pseudo-labels to the split data using previous model predictions and clustering- Mitigating catastrophic forgetting with a proxy anchor based exemplar 3. Demonstrating superior performance to prior methods on CGCD without requiring any prior knowledge about the unlabeled data. The method shows improved novel category discovery and forgetting mitigation on fine-grained datasets.4. Presenting analyses like the effectiveness of the proposed data splitting and exemplar methods through ablation studies. The method is shown to be robust to different ratios of known/novel categories.In summary, the key contribution appears to be introducing a more realistic yet challenging scenario for novel class discovery, and developing an unsupervised approach to address it effectively without prior knowledge about the unlabeled data. The proxy anchor based techniques for splitting data and generating representative exemplars seem to be important components of the proposed method.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the abstract and context provided, here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in novel category discovery:- This paper proposes a new scenario called "Continuous Generalized novel Category Discovery" (CGCD) that aims to be more realistic and challenging than prior work. It removes constraints like requiring disjoint labeled/unlabeled datasets or knowing the number/proportion of novel categories upfront. This compares favorably to other methods like NCD, GCD, and CCD-MI that make simplifying assumptions.- The proposed method uses proxy anchors, noisy label learning, and an exemplar-based approach to incrementally discover novel categories without prior knowledge. This is a unique approach compared to prior work like DRNCD, FRoST, and GM that rely more on clustering, semi-supervised learning, or distillation. The proxy anchor technique seems novel.- The experiments comprehensively evaluate performance on multiple fine-grained datasets using metrics like overall cluster accuracy, old category accuracy, forgetting, and novel discovery. The proposed method outperforms prior state-of-the-art across these metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness. - The approach is evaluated in more complex settings like two-step incremental discovery. ablation studies analyze the impact of different components. This level of analysis is more thorough than some prior work.- The technique is positioned as better mimicking real-world conditions and addressing limitations of prior methods. Removing constraints on labeled/unlabeled splits and lack of prior knowledge are important contributions.In summary, the proposed CGCD scenario, proxy anchor-based approach, and comprehensive experiments help differentiate this work and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the challenging problem of novel category discovery in more realistic uncontrolled settings. The novel techniques and reductions in assumptions compare favorably to related research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Adopting better clustering methods like DeepDPM: The authors mention that DeepDPM has shown strong performance on non-parametric clustering tasks. They suggest evaluating their proposed method by adopting DeepDPM or other improved clustering techniques for the novel category discovery step. This could further enhance performance.- Evaluating on more complex continual learning settings: The paper focuses on a one-step and two-step incremental novel category discovery scenario. The authors suggest evaluating their approach on more complex continual learning settings with more incremental steps.- Applying to other applications: The method is evaluated on fine-grained image classification tasks. The authors suggest exploring its application to other areas like few-shot learning, open-world recognition, open-set recognition etc.- Architectural improvements: The feature extractor and proxy anchor framework used in the paper can be further improved or optimized for the novel category discovery task. This is suggested as another direction.- Theoretical analysis: Providing more theoretical analysis and understanding of why the proposed proxy anchor framework works well for splitting known and novel categories could be valuable future work.In summary, the key future directions are: exploring better clustering techniques, more complex continual learning scenarios, new applications, architectural optimizations, and theoretical analysis to further advance the state-of-the-art in this area. The authors position their work as an important step towards real-world incremental novel category discovery.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning approach for continuous generalized novel category discovery (CGCD) that does not require prior knowledge about the number of novel categories or proportion of novel samples. The method leverages proxy anchors and noisy label learning to split unlabeled joint datasets into seen (old) and unseen (novel) categories. It first fine-tunes a feature extractor and proxy anchors on labeled data. Then it separates unlabeled data into old/novel sets using cosine similarity to proxy anchors and further refines this split using noisy label learning. Pseudo-labels are assigned using previous model predictions (seen) and clustering (unseen). A modified model with new proxy anchors is trained on the refined split dataset. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, the method uses a proxy anchor-based exemplar and distillation. Experiments on fine-grained datasets show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel category discovery and forgetting mitigation without requiring prior knowledge. Key innovations include the CGCD scenario, proxy anchor-based splitting and exemplar generation, and noisy label learning for refinement.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised learning of novel categories in a continual learning setting. The key ideas are:1) They introduce a new problem formulation called Continuous Generalized novel Category Discovery (CGCD) which does not require prior knowledge about the number/proportion of novel categories or assumption that novel and old categories are disjoint. This is more realistic than prior formulations like NCD, GCD, and class-iNCD. 2) The proposed method utilizes Proxy Anchors (PAs) to represent labeled data and split unlabeled data into old vs novel categories. Noisy labeling is used to refine the split. Pseudo-labels are assigned using model predictions for old and clustering for novel categories. 3) Training uses generated PA features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on fine-grained datasets show the method outperforms prior art in discovering novel categories and alleviating forgetting without requiring prior knowledge.In summary, this paper addresses limitations of prior work in novel category discovery to propose a more realistic problem formulation CGCD. A method using proxy anchors, noisy labeling and pseudo-labeling is introduced that shows better performance than state-of-the-art approaches on the new problem formulation. The key advantages are removing assumptions about novelty in the data and mitigating forgetting in a continual learning setup.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning approach for incremental novel category discovery that does not require prior knowledge about the number of novel categories or proportion of new class data. The method first fine-tunes a feature extractor and proxy anchors on labeled data. It then splits unlabeled joint data into old and novel categories using the trained proxy anchors and a noisy labeling scheme. The old categories are pseudo-labeled with the previous model's predictions, while the novel categories are clustered using a non-parametric method and pseudo-labeled. The method then trains a new model on the pseudo-labeled data with new proxy anchors for the novel clusters. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, it generates representative features from the old proxy anchors and employs distillation. The key aspects are using proxy anchors and noisy labeling for splitting without prior knowledge, pseudo-labeling old and novel categories differently, and leveraging proxy anchors to generate features to reduce forgetting.
