# [Finetuning Large Language Models for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Detecting vulnerabilities in source code is an important task in software engineering. Recent transformer models like CodeBERT have shown promise, but their limited capacity may restrict performance. 
- New 13B parameter language models (LLMs) like WizardCoder, trained on much more data, provide an opportunity to improve over CodeBERT-like models.
- It is unknown if the performance limit on this task is due to insufficient model capacity or other factors.

Proposed Solution:
- Finetune the state-of-the-art WizardCoder LLM model for binary vulnerability classification of Java functions.
- Use the LORA method to enable finetuning the 13B parameter model on limited GPU hardware.  
- Speed up training using a batch packing strategy to reduce unused padding.  
- Handle class imbalance with focal loss and sample weighting.
- Compare WizardCoder to CodeBERT-style models like ContraBERT.

Contributions:
- An efficient batch packing method is developed, providing a 13x speedup in training time.
- WizardCoder improves over ContraBERT by 0.03 ROC AUC on a balanced dataset and 0.05 on an imbalanced dataset, demonstrating the value of larger pretrained models.
- Focal loss with sample weighting leads to minor improvements on the imbalanced dataset.
- The WizardCoder's gains over CodeBERT-style models are smaller than expected, implying dataset quality and contextual usage may be limiting factors.
- A new high-quality vulnerability detection benchmark dataset is collected.

Overall the work shows finetuning large language models is a promising approach for specialized code analysis tasks like vulnerability detection, though opportunities remain for bigger improvements through better datasets and context usage.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents results of finetuning large language models, specifically WizardCoder, for vulnerability detection in source code, achieving improved performance over prior CodeBERT-based models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Developing an efficient batch packing strategy to mitigate small sequence lengths during training, providing over 13x speedup. This enables faster iteration and tuning.

2. Demonstrating an improvement in ROC AUC from 0.66 to 0.69 over the state-of-the-art non-LLM model ContraBERT on the X_1 dataset without the P_3 part. An improvement in F1 score is also shown on the dataset with P_3 (0.27 vs 0.22).

3. Showing that for the highly imbalanced dataset, the focal loss with sample weighting gives improvements from 0.86 to 0.878 ROC AUC. However, more advanced methods are still needed to properly emphasize the minority positive examples. 

4. Collecting a new and more precise vulnerability benchmark dataset that possesses higher-quality labels free from errors stemming from irrelevant code changes.

In summary, the main contributions are around finetuning large language models for vulnerability detection, developing efficient training strategies, benchmarking on datasets, and showing state-of-the-art quality improvements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions optimizing several hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs when finetuning the models. What impact does each of these hyperparameters have on model performance and how should they be tuned? 

2. The focal loss is used to handle class imbalance by emphasizing hard, misclassified examples. However, the paper notes only minor gains from using focal loss. What are some reasons focal loss was not more effective and how could it be improved?

3. Batch packing is introduced to mitigate short sequence lengths and speed up training. What are some potential downsides of batch packing, such as unstable gradients? How could techniques like dynamic gradient accumulation help address these?

4. The paper explores both next token prediction and binary classification training objectives. Why does the classification objective perform better and how does eliminating the generative modeling task enable more effective transfer learning? 

5. The model improvement over ContraBERT is smaller on the imbalanced dataset compared to the balanced dataset. What are some reasons for this smaller relative improvement? How could advanced sampling and data augmentation techniques help leverage the minority data better?

6. The paper introduces a more precisely labeled vulnerability dataset constructed to have higher quality labels. What are some examples of noise and errors in other benchmark datasets that this dataset aims to avoid? How do such label issues impact model training?

7. The StarCoder model capacity is much larger than needed for the task. What are some benefits and potential drawbacks of using an overparameterized model? How does the LORA method help mitigate excess capacity?

8. The paper states the performance gains are likely more due to improved representations than the increased context size. What experiments could isolate and test the impact of larger contexts versus better underlying representations?

9. What threats to validity should be considered when evaluating the method, such as potential dataset biases or leakage? How could techniques like project-based data splits help mitigate such threats?

10. The improvements from focal loss and sample weighting are minor. What other advanced techniques should be explored to properly emphasize minority data in highly skewed distributions? How can we leverage hard examples without losing easier data's signal?
