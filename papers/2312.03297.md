# [SoftMAC: Differentiable Soft Body Simulation with Forecast-based Contact   Model and Two-way Coupling with Articulated Rigid Bodies and Clothes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03297)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SoftMAC, a differentiable simulation framework that couples soft bodies simulated with the Material Point Method (MPM) with articulated rigid bodies and clothes. A key contribution is a novel forecast-based contact model for MPM that greatly reduces artifacts like penetration and unnatural rebounds during collisions. To enable coupling between MPM particles and non-volumetric clothes meshes, the authors also propose a penetration tracing algorithm that reconstructs signed distance fields locally. Based on simulators for each modality and the improved contact model, a differentiable two-way coupling mechanism is developed to simulate interactions between the materials. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks like pouring wine, making tacos, and manipulating doors demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of SoftMAC's differentiable pipeline for optimizing control policies that involve diverse materials. The method represents an important step towards unified differentiable physics simulation.
