# [An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Several popular linear models have recently been proposed for time series forecasting, including DLinear, FITS, RLinear and NLinear. These models often achieve strong performance, sometimes rivaling more complex deep learning models. However, it is unclear whether these various linear models are functionally different from each other or standard linear regression. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides an in-depth mathematical analysis of the model classes induced by these popular linear forecasting models. The authors formally prove that DLinear and FITS (without low-pass filtering) are equivalent to unconstrained linear regression. They also analyze how techniques like instance normalization and reversible instance normalization constrain the resulting model class. Overall, they categorize the models into 3 distinct classes:

1. Unconstrained linear regression (DLinear, FITS)
2. Linear regression with sum-to-one row constraint (NLinear) 
3. Linear regression with sum-to-one row constraint and bias scaled by instance standard deviation (RLinear, FITS+IN)

The convexity of least squares regression suggests these models should converge to similar solutions. Experiments confirm the models learn nearly identical weight matrices, with minor differences in the biases.

Main Contributions:

- Formal proofs that popular linear forecasting models like DLinear and FITS are equivalent to linear regression
- Characterization of how data normalization constraints alter the model classes
- Experimental validation that these models converge to similar solutions
- Demonstration that closed-form OLS solutions outperform SGD-trained models on 72% of settings

The key insight is that while many of these linear models are formulated differently, they only represent minor variations on linear regression. The simplicity of ordinary least squares, combined with a closed-form solution, makes it a strong baseline for time series forecasting.
