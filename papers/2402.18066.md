# [Six-Point Method for Multi-Camera Systems with Reduced Solution Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of estimating the 6DOF relative pose between two views of a multi-camera system using point correspondences (PCs). Determining the relative pose is a fundamental task with applications in SLAM, AR, etc. While 5 PCs suffice for a single camera, 6 PCs are necessary for a generalized multi-camera system. The paper reviews prior work on relative pose estimation for single cameras, generalized cameras as well as specialized methods for particular multi-camera configurations. However, minimal solvers that work for common multi-camera setups are lacking.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a series of 6-point minimal solvers for multi-camera systems:
1) A generic solver for generalized cameras constructed from 12 virtual perspectives cameras based on 6 input PCs.
2) Specialized solvers for two-camera configurations - inter-camera solver using PCs between different cameras and intra-camera solver using PCs in the same camera.  

The solvers use a framework that decouples rotation and translation. Rotation uses Cayley/quaternion parameterization and translation is eliminated using hidden variable technique. Ray bundle constraints are introduced and proven for PCs associating the same camera in two views. These constraints reduce solution space and improve numerical stability. The polynomial equation system is constructed and solved using Gr√∂bner bases.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes multiple 6-point minimal solvers for generalized cameras and two-camera configurations 
- Introduces and proves ray bundle constraints to reduce solutions and improve stability
- Framework decoupling rotation and translation that easily extends to other configurations  
- Enumerates all 5953 configurations for 6-point problems in multi-camera systems
- Demonstrates improved accuracy over state-of-the-art on synthetic and real datasets (KITTI, nuScenes, EuRoC)

In summary, the paper presents efficient and accurate 6-point minimal solvers for relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems with analysis of different configurations.
