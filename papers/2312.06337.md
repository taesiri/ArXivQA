# [Deep Imbalanced Learning for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in   Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06337)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Class Boundary Enhanced Representation Learning (CBERL) to address the multimodal emotion recognition task while handling the common data imbalance issue. CBERL tackles the data imbalance problem systematically from data augmentation, loss sensitivity, and sampling strategy perspectives. First, it uses a multimodal generative adversarial network to augment the minority emotion classes and balance the emotion distribution. Second, a deep joint variational autoencoder fuses complementary features across modalities to obtain discriminative representations. Finally, a multi-task graph neural network performs mask reconstruction and classification optimization to solve the overfitting and underfitting issues for minority classes during graph-based feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate that CBERL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for minority emotion categories like fear and disgust by 10-20% in accuracy and F1. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in handling data imbalance and learning enhanced boundary representations for multimodal emotion recognition.
