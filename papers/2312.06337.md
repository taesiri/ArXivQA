# [Deep Imbalanced Learning for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in   Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06337)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Class Boundary Enhanced Representation Learning (CBERL) to address the multimodal emotion recognition task while handling the common data imbalance issue. CBERL tackles the data imbalance problem systematically from data augmentation, loss sensitivity, and sampling strategy perspectives. First, it uses a multimodal generative adversarial network to augment the minority emotion classes and balance the emotion distribution. Second, a deep joint variational autoencoder fuses complementary features across modalities to obtain discriminative representations. Finally, a multi-task graph neural network performs mask reconstruction and classification optimization to solve the overfitting and underfitting issues for minority classes during graph-based feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate that CBERL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for minority emotion categories like fear and disgust by 10-20% in accuracy and F1. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in handling data imbalance and learning enhanced boundary representations for multimodal emotion recognition.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) is an important task for realizing machine intelligence. 
- However, MERC datasets naturally exhibit imbalanced distribution of emotion categories (e.g. "fear" and "disgust" emotions have very few samples). 
- This causes issues in learning accurate models, especially for minority emotion classes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new model called "Class Boundary Enhanced Representation Learning" (CBERL) to address data imbalance in MERC.

- CBERL has 5 key components:
   1) Data Augmentation using GANs to generate more minority class samples
   2) Feature Fusion using Deep Joint Variational Autoencoder (DJVAE) to capture complementary information between modalities  
   3) Context Feature Extraction using BiLSTM 
   4) Graph Interaction using a Multi-task Graph Neural Network (MGNN) with mask reconstruction and emotion classification to solve overfitting/underfitting issues
   5) Emotion Classification using an ensemble of weak classifiers

- Together these components aim to learn discriminative representations, especially for minority emotions.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to systematically address data imbalance in MERC from data augmentation, sampling strategy and loss-sensitive perspectives.

- A new GAN architecture for multimodal data augmentation tailored to MERC datasets.

- A DJVAE method for fusing complementary information between text, audio and visual modalities.

- A MGNN model with mask reconstruction and classification tasks to solve sampling bias.

- Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show CBERL outperforms state-of-the-art, especially on minority emotion classes like "fear" and "disgust" by 10-20%.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in addressing the important but less studied problem of data imbalance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversations.
