# [Creating Spoken Dialog Systems in Ultra-Low Resourced Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06266)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on spoken language understanding and intent classification for low-resource languages, using Flemish as a case study. The authors build on prior work using phoneme representations from speech for intent classification, and propose new data augmentation techniques to improve performance when training data is scarce. Their main contributions are applying augmentations at two levels: the voice level before phoneme recognition, using techniques like speed changes and volume boosts; and the phoneme transcript level after recognition, inserting noise based on Allosaurus probabilities and replacing phones with similar ones. Experiments on the Garbo Flemish dataset show their combination of voice augmentation and phoneme noise insertion outperforms baseline models, especially for classifying 4 intents with limited speakers and recordings. The authors conclude data augmentation holds promise for improving intent classification on low-resource languages, overcoming scarcity of quality training data. They plan to explore more sophisticated methods like speech synthesis in future work.
