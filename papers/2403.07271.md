# [Anderson acceleration for iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07271)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers a nonconvex and nonsmooth sparse optimization problem with a smooth loss term and nonconvex regularization. These problems arise in many areas but are challenging to solve due to nonconvexity and nonsmoothness.  
- Accelerated algorithms like FISTA have been applied to iteratively reweighted L1 methods (IRL1) but analysis poses difficulties. Existing works rely on restrictive Kurdyka-≈Åojasiewicz (KL) conditions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Anderson accelerated iteratively reweighted L1 algorithm (AAIRL1) which leverages Anderson acceleration ideas from fixed point iterations. 
- Anderson acceleration uses a linear combination of previous iterates to generate the next iterate. This helps accelerate convergence.
- To ensure global convergence, the paper also proposes Guard-AAIRL1 which uses a nonmonotone line search strategy. This allows acceptance of Anderson acceleration steps under sufficient descent.

Main Contributions:
- First work to establish local R-linear convergence guarantees for an accelerated IRL1 method without needing KL conditions. This is significant since KL conditions are restrictive.
- Introduces an Anderson acceleration framework for IRL1 and proves local linear convergence rate results - extending AA convergence theory to a nonsmooth setting.
- Proposes a globally convergent method using safeguarding and nonmonotone line search that ensures global convergence.
- Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art Nesterov accelerated IRL1 methods. Convergence is faster in terms of both time and iterations.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions regarding accelerating IRL1 methods using Anderson acceleration ideas as well as a globally convergent safeguarded variant.
