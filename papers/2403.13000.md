# [Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate text, there is a need to audit their usage, govern their applications, and mitigate potential harms. Existing watermarking techniques can embed human-imperceptible, machine-detectable patterns into generated text, but have limitations in detection efficiency (minimum tokens required for detection), especially for short texts and texts that have been post-edited.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new watermarking approach called \algo that embeds dual secret patterns into both the token probability distribution and sampling scheme of LLMs. This combines two independent watermarks to significantly improve detection efficiency. 

To avoid degrading text quality from modifying token probabilities, \algo uses a novel contrastive search sampling that minimizes token repetition and enhances diversity. Theoretical analysis shows the two watermarks do not interfere with each other.

Main Contributions:
1) A dual watermarking scheme for LLMs that jointly modifies probability distribution and sampling to improve detection efficiency.

2) A contrastive search sampling method that increases diversity and mitigates quality degradation.

3) Extensive empirical evaluation showing \algo requires 70\% fewer tokens for detection than state-of-the-art methods, with the best or second best text quality. It is especially robust to post-editing attacks like paraphrasing.

In summary, the key innovation is a high efficiency dual watermark scheme with contrastive search sampling to maintain text quality and diversity. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements in detection performance across metrics compared to existing techniques.
