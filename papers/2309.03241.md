# [GPT Can Solve Mathematical Problems Without a Calculator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03241)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can large language models accurately perform complex multi-digit arithmetic operations and solve math word problems when provided with sufficient training data and an appropriate training methodology?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Large language models struggle with executing accurate arithmetic operations, especially for large digits, decimals, and fractions, without relying on external calculator tools. This paper challenges this assumption.

2) Large language models have difficulty effectively solving math word problems due to directly provided answers that may not teach the underlying calculation rules. This paper aims to address this limitation.

3) By utilizing a step-by-step training strategy, curriculum learning, and a tailored dataset, a large language model can achieve high proficiency in both arithmetic calculations and math word problem solving.

In summary, the central research question revolves around assessing and enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models, specifically targeting their ability to perform accurate arithmetic calculations and effectively solve math word problems. The key hypotheses center on the notions that with proper training methodology and data, these models can excel at complex mathematical tasks, contrary to some common assumptions.
