# [NLP for Counterspeech against Hate: A Survey and How-To Guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Online hate speech is a growing issue that can lead to real-world violence. Counterspeech - non-aggressive responses that challenge hate speech while preserving free speech - is a promising strategy, but manually producing enough high-quality counterspeech is extremely difficult. Recent NLP research has begun exploring automating various counterspeech tasks to make this strategy more scalable, but best practices are still unclear.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper provides a comprehensive guide for conducting NLP research on counterspeech. It reviews 43 relevant studies on counterspeech datasets, classification, selection, and generation tasks. It proposes common terminology, analyzes the consequences of various data collection strategies, summarizes available datasets, and describes evaluation approaches. It also outlines open challenges in this space.

Main Contributions:
- Framing of counterspeech strategies and definitions compared to related tasks like hope speech and counter-trolling
- Analysis of crawling, crowdsourcing, nichesourcing, hybrid, and automated data collection procedures
- Detailed comparison of 15 existing counterspeech datasets on dimensions like size, collection strategy, available metadata, etc. 
- Review of studies on classifying counterspeech vs hate speech, classifying counterspeech strategies, selecting responses, and generating using knowledge/personalization/style
- Summary of intrinsic automatic metrics and human evaluation practices for assessing generation quality
- Discussion of key open challenges regarding language/culture, hate speech sources/types, hallucinations, evaluation limitations, and data collection biases

The paper structures this extensive analysis as an accessible guide for newcomers while also providing significant value to experts, in order to support future progress in automating counterspeech.
