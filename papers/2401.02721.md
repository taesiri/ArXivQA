# [A Cost-Efficient FPGA Implementation of Tiny Transformer Model using   Neural ODE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02721)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transformer models with attention mechanisms have shown great accuracy for image recognition tasks, but many models like ViT require a large number of parameters and datasets for training. This makes them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

- Hybrid models like BoTNet that combine CNN and Transformer architectures can work well with fewer parameters and smaller datasets, but are still too large for edge devices.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a tiny Transformer-based model by using Neural ODE to approximate the ResNet computation in BoTNet. This reuses the same parameters across multiple ResNet building blocks, reducing parameters by 94.6% compared to ResNet50.

- Replace spatial convolutions in BoTNet with depthwise separable convolutions to further reduce parameters without loss of accuracy.

- Implement the full feature extraction network on an FPGA using quantization-aware training for model compression to fit on modest FPGAs. All weights are stored on-chip to eliminate memory transfer overhead.

Main Contributions:
- Extremely lightweight Transformer model with only 1.26M parameters, 14.96x smaller than BoTNet and 94.6% smaller than ResNet50

- Achieves 80.15% accuracy on STL-10, comparable to much larger models, demonstrating benefit of CNN-Transformer hybrid

- FPGA implementation utilizes quantization and on-chip storage of weights for 12.8x speedup and 9.21x better energy efficiency compared to CPU

- Proposed model and FPGA design enable deploying attention models on edge devices with tight resource constraints, expanding their application

In summary, the paper presents a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid model using Neural ODE that can run efficiently on resource-limited FPGAs while retaining the accuracy benefits of attention mechanisms. The FPGA design eliminates overhead through compression and on-chip storage.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a highly compact CNN-Transformer hybrid model using Neural ODE, which is tailored for edge devices through extensive quantization and mapped onto an FPGA to enable efficient inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a tiny Transformer-based model by combining multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism with Neural ODE. Specifically, the paper:

1) Designs a lightweight CNN-Transformer hybrid model by using Neural ODE to approximate ResNet computation. This allows reusing the parameters of a single ResNet block multiple times, leading to 94.6% parameter size reduction compared to ResNet50.

2) Incorporates MHSA blocks into the model to improve accuracy while still maintaining small parameter size comparable to lightweight CNN models like MobileNets and EfficientNets.

3) Implements the entire tiny Transformer model on a modest FPGA by aggressive quantization using Quantization Aware Training. This eliminates unnecessary data transfers and allows on-chip storage of parameters, accelerating inference speed by 12.8x and improving energy efficiency by 9.21x over ARM CPU.

In summary, the main contribution is an extremely lightweight and hardware-efficient Transformer model enabled by combining Neural ODE and quantization techniques, along with an optimized FPGA implementation, for resource-constrained edge devices. The model strikes an excellent trade-off between accuracy, model size, and hardware efficiency.
