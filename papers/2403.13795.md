# [PyVRP: a high-performance VRP solver package](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are important combinatorial optimization problems with many real-world applications. Two common variants are the capacitated VRP (CVRP) and VRP with time windows (VRPTW).
- There exist several open-source VRP solvers, but they often lack state-of-the-art performance, flexibility, ease of use, good software engineering practices, or convenience through the Python ecosystem. This limits their usefulness for practitioners and as a basis for further research.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce PyVRP, an open-source Python package for solving CVRP and VRPTW through a hybrid genetic search (HGS) metaheuristic.
- PyVRP combines the flexibility of Python with high-performance C++ components. In particular, the computationally expensive local search is implemented in C++ while allowing customization in Python.
- It follows good software engineering principles with documentation, unit tests, and continuous integration. Binaries are provided for major platforms.

Main Contributions:
- PyVRP enables easily building on a state-of-the-art VRP solver through the Python ecosystem. It is convenient to use and customize.
- The implementation strikes a balance between simplicity and performance. Complex components were removed compared to previous versions that won challenges.
- Numerical experiments show PyVRP achieves excellent results on CVRP and VRPTW benchmarks, close to the state of the art.
- PyVRP is available under a permissive MIT license. The authors actively welcome community contributions to support more VRP variants.
- The package facilitates VRP research, especially for machine learning researchers who can now easily compare to a state-of-the-art VRP solver.
