# [RLHF-V: Towards Trustworthy MLLMs via Behavior Alignment from   Fine-grained Correctional Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, they suffer from a critical issue - they tend to produce factual hallucinations not grounded in the associated images, making the models untrustworthy. For example, they may describe non-existing objects, attributes, numbers, positions, and actions. Prior efforts to address this either undermine model capabilities or have limited effectiveness.

Proposed Solution - RLHF-V:  
The paper proposes RLHF-V, a framework to enhance MLLM trustworthiness by aligning model behaviors with fine-grained correctional human feedback. It has two key innovations:

(1) Collects human preference data in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinated text. This provides clear, dense and fine-grained signals to accurately learn preferred behaviors.  

(2) Performs Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO) to directly optimize the policy model using the fine-grained correctional feedback, efficiently excluding linguistic variance and non-robust shortcuts.  

The framework also addresses other sources of hallucinations - noisy text data and careless image augmentation.

Main Contributions:
(1) Presents RLHF-V for aligning MLLM behaviors via fine-grained human feedback.
(2) Provides high-quality human preference data with corrections on hallucinations. 
(3) Experiments show RLHF-V significantly enhances model trustworthiness and achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. The model also exhibits better robustness than GPT-4V regarding over-generalization.

In summary, the paper makes essential advances in improving the trustworthiness of MLLMs using human feedback, facilitating their application in real-world scenarios.
