# [Do Agents Dream of Electric Sheep?: Improving Generalization in   Reinforcement Learning through Generative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents require a huge amount of experience to learn, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. The paper investigates whether "dream-like" imagined experiences can improve generalization when the amount of real experience is limited, inspired by the "Overfitted Brain" hypothesis which states that dreams prevent overfitting in humans. 

Proposed Solution:
1) Learn a latent world model from limited real experience.
2) Generate "dream" trajectories by starting from random latent states and transforming some states along the trajectory via:
   - Random noise injections
   - DeepDream-style activation maximization 
   - Critic value optimization
to make them divergent and "dream-like". 
3) Continue training the RL agent on these dream trajectories.

The world model learns to encode, predict future states and rewards. The transformations introduce sudden changes (random noise), visual hallucinations (DeepDream) and new goals/obstacles (critic optimization) into trajectories.

Contributions:
- Propose generating divergent, human dream-like imagined trajectories to improve generalization in RL
- Define 3 types of transformations - random swings, DeepDreams and value diversification
- Evaluate on ProcGen environments: For sparse environments, the proposed method reaches higher rewards than standard imagination and offline training baselines

The key idea is that while standard imagination tries to accurately mimic reality, introducing corruptions helps expose the agent to more diverse situations not necessarily seen during the limited real experience, improving generalization. The proposed dream-like imagination approach is especially effective in sparse reward settings.
