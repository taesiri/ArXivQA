# [BESTMVQA: A Benchmark Evaluation System for Medical Visual Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07867)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents BESTMVQA, a Benchmark Evaluation System for Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). Med-VQA is an important task in healthcare where a system answers natural language questions based on medical images. Existing techniques often suffer from insufficient medical datasets for training and lack of thorough evaluation across models. 

To address this, BESTMVQA provides tools for automatically constructing Med-VQA datasets from clinical data to help overcome data scarcity. It also implements a library of state-of-the-art Med-VQA models that users can conveniently select for evaluation on a benchmark. The system then trains the models, evaluates them, and provides comprehensive results and analyses to reveal model applicability. 

Key system components include data preparation tools that extract images and text from clinical data to generate datasets. The model library covers various mainstream techniques including joint embeddings, encoder-decoders, attention networks, and large language models. For model practice, users can select datasets and models, and the system performs extensive experiments, including accuracy metrics for different question types, robustness analysis, and qualitative examples.

In summary, BESTMVQA enables easy dataset creation and rigorous evaluation of cutting-edge Med-VQA models to support advancement in this field and medical practice. Its benchmarking capabilities overcome limitations around model reproducibility and insufficient domain-specific data. The system aims to provide data-driven insights to develop new techniques for this challenging multi-modal problem.
