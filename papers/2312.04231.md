# [Adventures of Trustworthy Vision-Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04231)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a thorough review of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) through the lens of trustworthiness, examining three critical dimensions - bias and fairness, robustness, and interpretability. It discusses potential sources of bias in VLPMs stemming largely from the datasets used, analyzing proposed bias estimation and mitigation methods. Regarding robustness, the paper explores comparisons of VLPMs with CNNs, noting gaps in architecture-specific vulnerability studies tailored to transformers. For interpretability, the paper surveys gradient-based visualization methods and probing tasks, highlighting heavy reliance on attention mechanisms whose reliability as an explanation tool requires further scrutiny. Finally, the paper outlines open challenges for improving trust in VLPMs - establishing standardized assessment frameworks encompassing all aspects of trustworthiness, strategically utilizing cross-modal information flow, devising generalized and architecture-specific evaluation methods, exploring universal weight adaptation across modalities, and incorporating responsible data practices. Overall, this paper provides an extensive analysis of factors affecting the dependability of VLPMs to guide future efforts in enhancing their trustworthiness.
