# [DCoM: A Deep Column Mapper for Semantic Data Type Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12871)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we build an effective deep learning model for semantic data type detection that leverages raw text input rather than relying primarily on engineered features?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Treating column values as raw text and feeding them into advanced NLP models like LSTM, BERT, etc. will allow the model to learn useful features on its own and outperform models that rely mainly on engineered features. 2) Using a permutation-based approach to generate augmented training data will improve model performance compared to only using the original data.3) An ensemble approach with multiple predictions per test instance will boost test performance versus single-pass prediction.So in summary, the main research direction is exploring deep NLP models on raw text for semantic type detection, with a focus on permutation-based data augmentation and ensembling to enhance performance. The key hypothesis is that this approach can exceed previous benchmarks relying on feature engineering.
