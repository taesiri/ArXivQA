# [Cloud-Device Collaborative Adaptation to Continual Changing Environments   in the Real-world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00972)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the generalization ability and continuous domain adaptation capability of lightweight models deployed on devices when facing continually changing environments in the real world. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) By establishing a Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation paradigm, where the cloud server helps train and adapt the device model, the generalization ability and robustness of the device model can be improved.

2) An Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model can effectively transfer knowledge from a large teacher model on the cloud to the lightweight student model on the device, boosting its performance. 

3) Strategies like Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) and Visual Prompt Learning with Uncertainty Guided Updating (VPLU) can further enhance the collaboration and adaptation capabilities.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that through cloud-device collaboration and strategies like U-VPA, UGS, and VPLU, the continuous domain adaptation issue faced by lightweight models on devices can be addressed. The experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and methods.
