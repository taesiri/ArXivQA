# [Cloud-Device Collaborative Adaptation to Continual Changing Environments   in the Real-world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00972)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the generalization ability and continuous domain adaptation capability of lightweight models deployed on devices when facing continually changing environments in the real world. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) By establishing a Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation paradigm, where the cloud server helps train and adapt the device model, the generalization ability and robustness of the device model can be improved.

2) An Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model can effectively transfer knowledge from a large teacher model on the cloud to the lightweight student model on the device, boosting its performance. 

3) Strategies like Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) and Visual Prompt Learning with Uncertainty Guided Updating (VPLU) can further enhance the collaboration and adaptation capabilities.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that through cloud-device collaboration and strategies like U-VPA, UGS, and VPLU, the continuous domain adaptation issue faced by lightweight models on devices can be addressed. The experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation paradigm to deal with continually changing environments for device models. 

2. It designs an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model, which includes:

(a) An Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) strategy to select the most out-of-distribution samples from the device and transmit to the cloud, reducing bandwidth.

(b) A Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncertainty Guided Updating (VPLU) to align the source and target domains and transfer knowledge from the large teacher to the lightweight student model.

3. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on object detection under continual distribution shifts, improving performance by 4.4-13.6% in mAP.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new paradigm for cloud-device collaboration that enables device models to adapt to changing environments. The key novelty is the U-VPA teacher-student model to transfer generalization capability from the cloud to the device via uncertainty-guided sampling and visual prompt learning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach.
