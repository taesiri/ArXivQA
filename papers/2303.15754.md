# [Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Vision Transformers with Token   Gradient Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15754)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to improve the transferability of adversarial attacks on vision transformers (ViTs). Specifically, the authors aim to develop an effective transfer-based attack method that can generate adversarial examples using a source ViT model that can fool other target ViT and CNN models. 

The key hypothesis is that by regularizing the backpropagated gradients in the intermediate blocks of ViTs during the attack generation process, they can reduce the variance of the gradients and make the adversarial examples less reliant on model-specific features. This should improve the transferability of the attacks across different model architectures.

To test this hypothesis, they propose a Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) method that eliminates extreme gradients for individual patch tokens in the Attention, MLP, and QKV components of ViT blocks. By smoothing the gradients in this way, the adversarial examples are less likely to get stuck in poor local optima during optimization and should transfer better.

The main research contributions are:

- Proposing TGR to regularize gradients inside ViT blocks to improve transferability.

- Extensive experiments showing TGR outperforms prior attacks by significant margins against ViT and CNN models.

- Demonstrating TGR can be combined with other attacks like PatchOut for further gains.

- Analyses revealing TGR reduces gradient variance throughout ViT models compared to other attacks.

So in summary, the key research question is how to craft more transferable adversarial attacks on ViTs, with the hypothesis that regularizing intermediate gradients will help. The TGR method is proposed and evaluated to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new attack method called Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) for generating transferable adversarial examples against vision transformers (ViTs). 

2. TGR regularizes the backpropagated gradients in each internal block of ViTs in a token-wise manner to reduce the gradient variance and make the update direction more stable. This helps the adversarial examples escape poor local optima and be more transferable. 

3. Extensive experiments show that TGR outperforms state-of-the-art attacks like MIM, VMI, SGM, and PNA by a significant margin in attacking both ViTs and CNNs. It improves transferability by 8.8% on average against ViTs and 6.2% against CNNs.

4. Analysis shows that TGR effectively reduces the gradient variance in intermediate layers during backpropagation. Experiments also demonstrate its effectiveness when adapted to attack CNNs.

5. Ablation studies validate the contribution of different components in ViTs to transferability and the impact of the number of regularized tokens.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing TGR to improve transferable adversarial attacks on ViTs by regularizing backpropagated gradients in a token-wise manner according to the architecture of ViTs. Both analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) method to generate more transferable adversarial samples against vision transformers by reducing the variance of backpropagated gradients in the intermediate layers of the model during the attack process.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of adversarial attacks on vision transformers:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new attack method called Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) that is specifically designed for adversarial attacks on vision transformers (ViTs). Most prior work has focused on attacking CNNs, so this addresses an important gap by tailoring an attack to ViT architectures.

- The key idea behind TGR is to regularize the gradient during backpropagation in a token-wise manner within each block of the ViT. This helps reduce variance in the gradients and generate more transferable adversarial examples. Other recent work like VMI also uses gradient regularization, but operates only at the input level rather than within the network blocks.

- The experiments demonstrate substantially improved transferability compared to prior attacks like MIM, VMI, SGM and PNA. On average, TGR achieves around 8-9% higher attack success rates against ViT models. This is a significant boost over state-of-the-art.

- An interesting finding is that TGR also works reasonably well for attacking CNNs when applied to intermediate feature maps, even though it was designed for ViTs. This suggests the gradient regularization concept is broadly useful.

- Compared to some other recent ViT attack papers like SE and TR, a benefit of TGR is it does not require modifying or fine-tuning the classification tokens, so can be applied more readily to different ViT architectures.

- One limitation is that TGR has only been demonstrated on image classification models so far. Testing it for other tasks like object detection could be interesting future work.

Overall, I think this paper makes a valuable contribution by developing a novel and effective attack tailored to ViT models. The results convincingly demonstrate improvements over prior art in this emerging space of understanding adversarial robustness for transformers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Designing new defense methods to defend against transferable adversarial samples generated by vision transformers (ViTs). The paper shows that adversarial samples crafted by ViTs can successfully attack CNN models, even adversarially trained ones. Therefore, developing more robust defense techniques is an important direction.

2. Extending the proposed Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) method to other model architectures beyond ViTs and CNNs. The authors demonstrate that TGR can be adapted to CNNs as well, indicating it may generalize to other architectures. Exploring this could improve transfer attacks more broadly.

3. Combining TGR with other compatible attack algorithms to further boost transferability. The paper briefly shows TGR can be combined with input transformation methods like PatchOut. More exploration on integrating TGR into ensemble attacks could be beneficial. 

4. Conducting more in-depth analysis on why TGR is effective for improving transferability. While the paper empirically validates the advantages of TGR, further analysis on the theoretical mechanisms could provide more insights.

5. Considering computational efficiency and model sensitivity when tuning the hyper-parameters of TGR. As the ablation studies show, factors like the number of extreme tokens impact performance and efficiency. Optimizing these factors could improve applicability.

In summary, the main directions are developing corresponding defenses against transfer attacks from ViTs, generalizing TGR to other model types, integrating TGR into ensemble attack methods, providing more theoretical analysis of TGR, and tuning the hyper-parameters for optimal efficiency and effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) for generating transferable adversarial attacks against vision transformers (ViTs). The key idea is to reduce the variance of the backpropagated gradients in the intermediate blocks of ViTs by regularizing the "token gradients" in a token-wise manner. Specifically, they identify and eliminate extreme token gradients during backpropagation before using the regularized gradients to craft adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that TGR improves transferability against both ViT and CNN models compared to prior arts. The proposed method is shown to be compatible with other attack techniques like PatchOut. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of regularizing internal network gradients, instead of just input gradients, for more transferable adversarial attacks on modern vision models like ViTs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) for generating transferable adversarial attacks against vision transformers (ViTs). ViTs are neural network architectures based on transformers that have achieved state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks. However, like other neural networks, ViTs are vulnerable to adversarial examples - inputs crafted to fool the model. The authors focus on transfer-based attacks where an adversarial example is generated on one model and then transferred to attack another unknown "black-box" model. 

The key idea of TGR is to regularize the gradients during backpropagation in a token-wise manner, according to the architecture of ViTs. Specifically, TGR identifies tokens in the intermediate layers with extreme gradient values and eliminates those values to reduce overall gradient variance. This helps smooth the gradient and avoid getting stuck in poor local optima when generating the adversarial example. Experiments on ImageNet show that TGR significantly outperforms prior attacks, improving success rates against ViTs by 8.8% on average. TGR also shows strong transferability to CNNs, outperforming baselines by 6.2% on average. The results demonstrate that TGR produces more transferable adversarial examples by accounting for the transformer structure.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) method for transferable adversarial attacks on vision transformers (ViTs). The key idea is to reduce the variance of the backpropagated gradient in each internal block of ViTs in a token-wise manner during the process of crafting adversarial examples. 

Specifically, the paper examines the backpropagated gradients of the classification loss with respect to token representations in each block of ViTs, which they refer to as "token gradients". They identify tokens with extreme gradient values as contributing most to high gradient variance. The TGR method eliminates these extreme token gradients in a token-wise manner to obtain a regularized gradient for updating the adversarial examples. This is done separately for the attention, QKV, and MLP components in each ViT block. By reducing gradient variance in this way, the method helps stabilize the update direction and avoids getting stuck in poor local optima, resulting in more transferable adversarial samples. Extensive experiments on attacking ViTs and CNNs demonstrate the superiority of TGR over existing methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper proposes a new method called Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) for generating transferable adversarial attacks against vision transformers (ViTs). The key points are:

- Existing transfer-based attacks like gradient variance reduction methods do not work well on ViTs. This is due to the large variance of gradients in intermediate blocks of ViTs, and also the architectural differences between ViTs and CNNs.

- To address this, the paper proposes TGR which regularizes the gradients in a token-wise manner within each ViT block. This reduces the variance of gradients propagated through the network, resulting in more transferable attacks. 

- TGR is applied to key components in ViTs - the attention, MLP blocks, and QKV projections. It identifies and zeros out extreme token gradients in these components.

- Experiments show TGR significantly outperforms prior attacks like MIM, VMI, SGM, PNA on transferrability against ViTs by 8.8% and against CNNs by 6.2% on average.

So in summary, the key contribution is a new method TGR to generate more transferable adversarial attacks against vision transformers, by accounting for their architectural properties. The paper empirically demonstrates the improved transferability against both ViT and CNN models over state-of-the-art attacks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) to generate more transferable adversarial examples for attacking vision transformers (ViTs). TGR is motivated by the limitations of existing gradient regularization methods, which try to stabilize the update direction and escape poor local optima by regularizing the input gradients. However, the variance of gradients in the intermediate blocks of ViTs can still be large, causing the adversarial examples to focus on model-specific features and get stuck in local optima. TGR addresses this by reducing the variance of backpropagated gradients in each internal block of ViTs in a token-wise manner. It identifies "extreme tokens" with the largest gradient magnitudes and eliminates their gradients before using the regularized gradients to craft adversarial examples. Experiments on ImageNet models demonstrate TGR's superiority, improving average attack success rate against ViTs by 8.8% and against CNNs by 6.2% over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of applying TGR to different ViT components. Overall, by catering to ViTs' architecture through token-wise gradient regularization, TGR generates more transferable adversarial examples to expose deficiencies of ViT models before deployment.
