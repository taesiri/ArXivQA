# [LLM Jailbreak Attack versus Defense Techniques -- A Comprehensive Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13457)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper conducts a comprehensive study on jailbreak attacks and defense techniques for large language models (LLMs). Jailbreak attacks refer to using specially crafted prompts to circumvent the safety measures in place for LLMs that are designed to curb the generation of harmful content. 

The main contributions of this study are:

1) Evaluating the effectiveness of 9 prominent jailbreak attack techniques from prior works across 3 major LLMs - Llama, Vicuna, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. The attacks are categorized into generative methods (relying on optimizing loss metrics) and template methods. 

2) Assessing the robustness of 7 defense mechanisms, including open-source libraries and API services, against the attack techniques when protecting the LLMs. Defenses are grouped into self-processing methods, additional helper methods, input permutation methods and perplexity-based methods.

3) Releasing the first comprehensive benchmark with implementations of attacks and defenses for further research into LLM security.

Key findings:
- Template attack methods significantly outperform gradient-based generative methods, especially in black-box attack scenarios. Special tokens like '[/INST]' markedly impact attack success rates.
- Current defense techniques remain largely inadequate, with the Bergeron method being most effective yet still limited. Strict defenses also block benign inputs.  

The results underscore the need for more advanced defenses and establishing standardized evaluation protocols for LLM security. The released artifacts aim to promote continued research to address the prevalent issue of jailbreaking vulnerabilities.
