# [Group DETR: Fast DETR Training with Group-Wise One-to-Many Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13085)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can one-to-many assignment be feasibly applied to DETR (Detection Transformer) training to accelerate convergence while maintaining end-to-end detection without NMS (non-maximum suppression)?The key points:- DETR relies on one-to-one assignment during training, where each ground-truth object is assigned to a single prediction. - One-to-many assignment, where each ground-truth object is assigned to multiple predictions, has been successful in accelerating training of other detectors like Faster R-CNN and FCOS. - But naive one-to-many assignment does not work for end-to-end DETR training.- This paper introduces "Group DETR", which uses group-wise one-to-many assignment and separate self-attention to enable effectively applying one-to-many assignment to accelerate DETR training, while still maintaining end-to-end detection without NMS.So in summary, the central research question is how to feasibly adapt one-to-many assignment to accelerate DETR training convergence, using the proposed Group DETR method. The key hypothesis is that Group DETR with group-wise one-to-many assignment and separate self-attention can achieve this acceleration for DETR.
