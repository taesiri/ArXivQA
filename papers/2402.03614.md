# [Bayesian Factorised Granger-Causal Graphs For Multivariate Time-series   Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Discovering causal relations from multivariate time-series (MTS) data is important for understanding dynamics and making predictions. Granger causality (GC) is a fundamental framework for causal discovery on MTS data.
- Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are commonly used for GC discovery but have limitations: 
    - Sparsity-inducing penalties/thresholds used to interpret coefficients as binary graphs lead to uncertainty quantification issues 
    - Deep VAR methods need lots of data, have many hyperparameters, and are less uncertainty-aware
    - Traditional Bayesian VAR methods estimate posteriors over coefficients rather than binary GC graphs directly

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Bayesian VAR model that introduces a separate generative process modeling binary GC graphs 
- Impose a Poisson factorised prior (PFGCG) over binary GC graphs that:
    - Allows posterior inference over graphs to quantify uncertainty 
    - Uses a sparsity-controlling mechanism for sparse MTS data
    - Is nonparametric to reduce hyperparameters
- Develop an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference of binary GC graphs by using data augmentation techniques  

Main Contributions:
- Introduce a Bayesian model with hierarchical prior modeling binary GC graphs separate from VAR coefficients
- Propose the Poisson factorised prior (PFGCG) over binary graphs with flexible sparsity control 
- Develop efficient Bayesian inference algorithm with local conjugacy 
- Experiments show the method works much better than Bayesian/deep VAR methods, especially on sparse MTS data

In summary, the key innovation is the separate modeling of VAR coefficients and binary GC graphs, along with using the Poisson factorised prior to capture graph sparsity. This allows better uncertainty quantification and performance than existing Bayesian/deep VAR methods.
