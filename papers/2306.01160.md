# [Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash   Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01160)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we extend FlashAttention to efficiently handle sparse attention patterns beyond just the standard causal triangular mask?The key ideas and contributions seem to be:- Developing a Sparse Causal Flash Attention (SCFA) GPU kernel that can handle arbitrary sparsity patterns expressed as ranges of keys per query.- Showing how SCFA enables efficient implementations of dynamic hash-based attention (extending ideas from Reformer) as well as query/key dropping attention. - Demonstrating speedups and maintained perplexity on language modeling tasks using SCFA for hash-based and query/key dropping attention, compared to standard FlashAttention.So in summary, the main goal is to expand FlashAttention to support more flexible sparse attention patterns, beyond just the fixed causal mask. This then enables faster implementations of promising dynamic sparse attention methods like hashing and query/key dropping.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The authors develop an efficient GPU kernel called Sparse Causal Flash Attention (SCFA) that extends the FlashAttention method to handle irregular sparsity patterns in the attention matrix. FlashAttention is limited to regular lower triangular masking, while SCFA can handle arbitrary query/key selections and hash-based blocking.2. The authors use SCFA to revisit hash-based sparse attention, developing an algorithm that restricts attention to hash collision blocks. Unlike prior work like Reformer, their method computes the exact attention while avoiding the approximation and coverage issues of existing hashing schemes. 3. The authors propose an approach implemented in SCFA for dynamically selecting queries and keys to remove per head, instead of having to prune entire heads or tokens. This provides finer-grained sparsification. 4. They demonstrate experimentally that SCFA enables efficient training of Transformers with dynamic sparse attention patterns, significantly speeding up training over full FlashAttention for long sequences. The hash-based attention outperforms Reformer and matches perplexity of full attention baselines while speeding up training. Query/key dropping also accelerates training without much perplexity loss.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the SCFA kernel and how it enables and accelerates various forms of dynamic sparse attention during Transformer training. This allows revisiting promising sparsity paradigms like hashing and dropping, while avoiding limitations of prior implementations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an extension of the FlashAttention method to efficiently handle irregular sparsity patterns in the Transformer self-attention, enabling faster training of language models through techniques like hashing attention and dropping queries/keys.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents an extension of the FlashAttention mechanism to accommodate sparse attention patterns, allowing for more efficient training of transformer models on long sequences. Here are some key ways it relates to other recent work on efficient transformer attention:- It builds directly on FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022), which uses tiling and on-the-fly computation to avoid materializing the full attention matrix. This paper shows how FlashAttention can be extended beyond just the standard causal masking pattern.- Like BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) and Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), it aims to sparsify the full transformer self-attention matrix to improve efficiency. However, those methods use fixed sparse patterns, whereas this work focuses on dynamic sparsity.- It revisits ideas from Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) of using hashing to identify high-similarity key-query pairs. But it avoids Reformer's limitations of needing to split the sequence into fixed chunks and not computing some collided pairs.- The query/key dropping is related to Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019) which also drop individual queries/keys. But here the dropping is dynamic instead of using predefined sparse patterns.- Compared to linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performers (Choromanski et al., 2020), Linformers (Wang et al., 2020) etc. which approximate dot-product attention, this keeps the exact computation but makes it sparse.So in summary, a key contribution is enabling sparse attention patterns in a dynamic data-dependent way, while still performing the exact dot-product attention calculations. The FastFlashAttention kernel allows this while maintaining efficiency that can exceed the standard FlashAttention on long sequences.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions the authors suggest:- Developing more advanced methods for dynamically selecting which keys and queries to drop or keep when sparsifying the attention matrix. The paper uses simple random dropping as a proof of concept, but suggests exploring more intelligent schemes that take into account the input content.- Exploring different hashing schemes beyond the locality-sensitive hashing used in the paper, to better capture semantic similarity between keys and queries when sparsifying via hashing.- Combining their dynamic sparse attention schemes with other orthogonal methods for improving transformer efficiency, like layer dropping or pruning entire heads.- Adapting their sparse attention implementations for other modalities beyond text, such as images, video, or speech.- Extending their approach to other attention mechanisms besides standard dot-product attention, like convolutional attention or performer attention.- Analyzing the effect of different sparse attention schemes on model performance for various downstream tasks beyond language modeling.- Developing specialized hardware or architectures optimized for efficient implementation of dynamic sparse attention algorithms.- Exploring dynamic sparse attention in large pretrained models like GPT-3 to reduce their computational and memory requirements.- Studying the theoretical properties of transformers and attention more broadly under different sparsity assumptions.So in summary, the authors propose many directions around developing more advanced sparsification techniques, adapting their approach to different modalities/models/tasks, combining with other efficiency methods, and leveraging specialized hardware or architectures for sparse attention. Analyzing the theoretical implications is also suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an extension of the efficient FlashAttention implementation for transformer models to accommodate dynamic sparse attention patterns. Two main approaches are introduced - QK-sparse attention which drops individual query/key heads, and Hash-sparse attention which restricts attention to hash collision blocks based on locality-sensitive hashing. Compared to existing sparse attention methods like the Reformer which use fixed sparsity patterns, these dynamic sparse attention schemes can achieve significant speedups without compromising perplexity. The proposed sparse causal Flash attention (SCFA) GPU kernel handles non-triangular causal masking arising from dropped queries/keys or hashing. Experiments on language modeling show that SCFA permits 2-3x speedups over FlashAttention for long sequences, matching or exceeding the perplexity of dense attention baselines. Overall, the work demonstrates how dynamic sparse attention can be efficiently implemented to reduce the quadratic computational complexity of transformers for large sequence modeling tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents an extension of the FlashAttention method called Sparse Causal Flash Attention (SCFA) to efficiently compute sparse attention patterns in transformers. SCFA can handle irregular sparsity structures that arise from techniques like dropping keys/queries or using locality sensitive hashing. The authors first present the SCFA GPU kernel that can compute attention over any sparsity pattern defined by a range of keys per query. They then show how SCFA enables efficient implementations of key/query dropping and hash-based attention without approximating the attention computation. Experiments demonstrate that SCFA provides significant speedups over FlashAttention for sparse attention, especially for long sequences. On language modeling tasks, SCFA allows 2-3x faster training without loss of perplexity by leveraging query/key dropping or hash-based sparsity. The work makes sparse attention practical and extends the contexts where transformers can be applied.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an extension of the FlashAttention implementation called Sparse Causal Flash Attention (SCFA). SCFA relaxes the constraint in FlashAttention that the causal mask has to be triangular, allowing it to handle sparse attention patterns where only certain query-key pairs are computed. The key ideas are: 1) Provide additional index vectors indicating which keys and queries to keep. 2) Sort/reorder the key, query, and value tensors based on these index vectors. 3) Modify the FlashAttention kernel to iterate over blocks of keys and determine start/stop indices for relevant key blocks using the index vectors. 4) Apply causal masking within computed tiles using the index vectors. This allows SCFA to efficiently compute sparse attention matrices like those arising from key/query dropping or locality-sensitive hashing. The paper shows SCFA enables faster training of transformer language models using these sparse attention schemes.
