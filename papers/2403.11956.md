# [Subjective-Aligned Dateset and Metric for Text-to-Video Quality   Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-video (T2V) generation has advanced rapidly, producing high quality videos from text descriptions. However, evaluating the quality of generated videos is challenging. 
- Existing metrics like IS, FVD, and CLIPSim have limitations in capturing text-video alignment and video fidelity. There is a need for better evaluation metrics aligned with human judgments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new dataset called T2VQA-DB containing 10,000 text-generated videos from 9 models along with human opinion scores. This is the largest text-to-video quality assessment dataset to date.
- Based on this dataset, a novel transformer-based model called T2VQA is proposed for text-video quality assessment. It extracts features capturing text-video alignment using BLIP and video fidelity using Swin Transformer. These features are fused and fed to a large language model to predict human opinion scores.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the largest text-to-video quality assessment dataset with 10,000 videos and human scores, to facilitate progress in this area. 
- Proposal of a state-of-the-art transformer model T2VQA that outperforms existing metrics in capturing human judgments of text-video quality by considering both alignment and fidelity.
- Extensive experiments demonstrating T2VQA's effectiveness over strong baseline methods, and analyses providing insights into model design choices.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through creation of a novel dataset and proposal of an effective learned model to address the challenging problem of automatically evaluating text-to-video generation quality.
