# [LanSER: Language-Model Supported Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03978)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to leverage large unlabeled speech datasets to improve speech emotion recognition (SER) models without requiring expensive human annotation. 

Specifically, the paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate "weak" emotion labels from transcripts of unlabeled speech data. These weak labels are then used to pre-train a SER model in a weakly supervised manner. The hypothesis is that pre-training with large amounts of unlabeled speech data and weak emotion labels generated by LLMs can improve performance on downstream SER tasks compared to training only on small labeled datasets.

The key research questions examined in the paper include:

- Can LLMs generate useful weak emotion labels from speech transcripts that can be used to pre-train SER models?

- Does pre-training SER models on large unlabeled speech datasets with weak emotion labels from LLMs improve performance on downstream SER tasks compared to training only on labeled data? 

- Can models pre-trained in this way capture emotional information in speech prosody, even though the weak labels are derived only from speech content?

- How does the amount and type of unlabeled pre-training data impact model performance?

- How does the choice of emotion taxonomy used for weak label generation impact model performance?

In summary, the central hypothesis is that LLMs can automatically generate weak supervision to enable pre-training SER models on large unlabeled datasets and improve downstream task performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LanSER, a method that enables using large unlabeled speech datasets for training speech emotion recognition models. LanSER uses large language models to generate weak emotion labels for unlabeled speech data by inferring the emotion from speech transcripts. These weak labels are then used to pre-train a speech emotion recognition model. The key ideas are:

- Using large language models and textual entailment to infer weak emotion labels from speech transcripts, constrained to a predefined taxonomy. This avoids costly human annotations.

- Showing that pre-training speech models on large unlabeled datasets using these weak labels from language models improves performance on downstream emotion recognition tasks compared to supervised baselines. 

- Demonstrating that despite training only using weak labels from speech transcripts, the models learn useful prosodic representations relevant for speech emotion recognition. This is evidenced by the improved performance on CREMA-D which has fixed lexical content.

- Enabling zero-shot emotion recognition by pre-training with the taxonomy of the downstream task.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel weakly supervised learning method to leverage large unlabeled speech data for speech emotion recognition by using large language models to infer weak emotion labels from transcripts. This is shown to improve model performance and label efficiency.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in speech emotion recognition:

- Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate weak labels for speech emotion recognition, reducing the need for human-labeled data. This is a novel approach compared to most prior work that relies on labeled datasets.

- Leverages textual entailment and prompt engineering with LLMs to generate emotion labels constrained to a predefined taxonomy. This allows exploring more nuanced emotion taxonomies compared to related work like in sentiment analysis.

- Shows pre-training with weak labels from unlabeled speech improves performance on downstream SER tasks. This demonstrates the potential of weak supervision from LLMs for SER.

- Tests on a linguistically-constrained dataset (CREMA-D) to show the learned representations capture emotional prosody, not just lexical cues. Most prior SER research focuses on lexical/semantic content.

- Explores very large unlabeled speech datasets (up to 30K hours) for pre-training. Many recent efforts use self-supervised learning on unlabeled data, but this paper shows the benefits of using weak emotion labels from LLMs during pre-training.

- Achieves improved sample efficiency/data efficiency by fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a fraction of labeled data from standard benchmarks.

- Does not aim to achieve state-of-the-art results on SER benchmarks, but shows promising directions for reducing labeled data needs.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel direction for SER using LLMs and weak supervision that could help overcome challenges with limited labeled data and simple emotion taxonomies. The results are promising but there is room for improvement in areas like prompt engineering and model capacities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several possible future research directions:

- Reducing weak label noise through filtering mechanisms or modifying prompts to include more conversational context like previous/next utterances or scene descriptions. This could help the language models generate cleaner weak labels.

- Using language models to generate weak labels from an open-set taxonomy rather than a fixed taxonomy. This could better leverage the expressiveness of large language models.

- Exploring higher capacity backbone models like Conformers rather than ResNet-50. More complex models may better capture the relationship between speech and emotion when pre-trained on large unlabeled datasets. 

- Incorporating self-supervised learning techniques in addition to the weak supervision approach. Combining the two methodologies could be complementary for speech emotion recognition.

- Improving zero-shot performance when adapting the pre-trained models to new datasets/taxonomies without fine-tuning.

- Evaluating on additional benchmark datasets beyond IEMOCAP and CREMA-D to better assess generalization.

- Prompt engineering and tuning could potentially improve the textual entailment process for generating weak labels.

In summary, the main future directions are enhancing the weak label generation process, using more complex backbone models, combining self-supervised learning, improving zero-shot generalization, and more rigorous benchmarking. The paper provides a good starting point for future work on leveraging large unlabeled speech data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents LanSER (Language-model Supported Speech Emotion Recognition), a method that enables using large unlabeled speech datasets for training speech emotion recognition models by inferring weak emotion labels from speech transcripts using pre-trained language models. The key ideas are:

1) Use ASR to extract text transcripts from speech utterances. 

2) Feed transcripts into a pre-trained language model to infer a weak emotion label constrained to a predetermined taxonomy using textual entailment. Select the label with highest entailment score.

3) Use the weak labels to pre-train a speech emotion recognition model on a large unlabeled dataset. 

4) Fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream datasets.

Experiments show models pre-trained this way outperform baselines when fine-tuned on IEMOCAP and CREMA-D emotion datasets. The method improves label efficiency and captures prosodic information relevant to emotion recognition despite using only text to derive labels. Overall, the paper demonstrates using language models to reduce reliance on labeled data for training speech emotion recognition models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:

In this paper, the authors propose LanSER, a novel method for speech emotion recognition that enables utilizing large unlabeled speech datasets by generating weak emotion labels via pre-trained large language models. Specifically, they extract text transcripts from speech utterances using automatic speech recognition, and then leverage large language models to infer emotion labels for the transcripts using a textual entailment approach. These weak labels are then used to pre-train a speech emotion recognition model in a weakly-supervised manner on the unlabeled data. 

The authors demonstrate through experiments on benchmark emotion recognition datasets that models pre-trained with LanSER improve performance and label efficiency when fine-tuned on the downstream tasks compared to baselines. They also find that despite the weak labels being derived solely from speech content, LanSER appears to learn useful representations of speech prosody for emotion recognition. Overall, LanSER provides a promising direction to reduce reliance on labeled data in speech emotion recognition by exploiting the correlation between speech content and prosody for emotion expression. Key advantages are the ability to leverage large unlabeled speech corpora and to explore more granular emotion taxonomies.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes LanSER, a method that enables the use of unlabeled speech data for training speech emotion recognition (SER) models. The key ideas are:

1. Extract text transcripts from speech utterances using automatic speech recognition (ASR). 

2. Use large pre-trained language models (LLMs) to infer weak emotion labels from the transcripts, constrained to a predetermined taxonomy, via textual entailment. Specifically, they calculate entailment scores between the transcript (hypothesis) and candidate emotion labels (premises), and select the label with the highest score.

3. Use the weak labels derived from transcripts to pre-train a SER model on a large unlabeled speech dataset in a weakly-supervised manner. 

4. Fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream SER datasets. Experiments show the model pre-trained with weak supervision improves performance and label efficiency compared to training only on the downstream datasets.

5. Analysis shows that despite using only text to derive labels, the learned representations capture prosodic information relevant for SER.

In summary, the key method is using LLMs and textual entailment to automatically generate weak emotion labels from transcripts of unlabeled speech, which are then used to pre-train SER models to improve performance when adapted to downstream tasks. This reduces the dependency on costly human annotations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of scaling up speech emotion recognition (SER) models to large datasets and nuanced emotion taxonomies. The key problems/questions it tackles are:

- Current SER models rely on costly human-labeled data, making it difficult to scale up training with large unlabeled speech corpora. 

- Existing SER benchmarks use limited emotion taxonomies (4-6 categories typically), which do not capture the nuance and variability in human emotional expression.

- Can we leverage large unlabeled speech datasets to train SER models without costly human annotation?

To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel method called LanSER that enables using large unlabeled speech data for pre-training SER models by:

- Using automatic speech recognition (ASR) to extract text transcripts from speech utterances. 

- Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to infer "weak" emotion labels from the transcripts via textual entailment.

- Pre-training a SER model on the large unlabeled data with the weak labels from the LLM.

The key hypothesis is that the emotions congruent with speech content (text) can serve as weak supervision to pre-train effective SER models, reducing the need for human labeling. The paper validates this hypothesis by showing LanSER models pre-trained on large unlabeled data sets improve performance on SER benchmarks when fine-tuned.

In summary, the paper aims to tackle the scalability and limited emotion taxonomy issues in SER by exploring self-supervision from LLMs to reduce reliance on costly human labeling of data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper proposes using LLMs like BERT and RoBERTa to generate weak emotion labels from speech transcripts. This allows pre-training SER models on unlabeled data.

- Weak supervision: The emotion labels predicted by the LLMs are treated as "weak" supervision since they are not from human raters. The paper explores using these weak labels for pre-training.

- Textual entailment: The authors use textual entailment between a speech transcript and emotion label prompts to predict a weak emotion label from the LLM.

- Low resource SER: A goal is to improve SER with limited labeled data by leveraging unlabeled speech with LLMs.

- Prosody modeling: The paper shows the learned representations capture prosodic information related to emotions, despite using only text for supervision.
