# [The Generalization Gap in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods have shown promise on single environments, but their ability to generalize to new environments is unclear. 
- There is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate generalization of offline RL algorithms across different transition dynamics or reward functions.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new offline RL datasets based on Procgen (procedurally generated 2D games) and WebShop (e-commerce website) that require generalizing to new levels or instructions. 
- Benchmark offline RL algorithms like BCQ, CQL, behavioral cloning (BC), and sequence modeling methods on these datasets.
- Evaluate how factors like data diversity and size impact generalization.

Key Findings:
- When trained on data from multiple environments, BC outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods in both train and test environments.  
- Increasing diversity rather than size of training data improves generalization more.
- Existing offline RL methods underperform online RL in terms of generalization to new environments.
- Behavioral cloning is a competitive baseline for offline RL benchmarks requiring generalization.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark focused specifically on generalization in offline RL
- Findings revealing offline RL methods struggle with generalization compared to online RL
- Open source datasets to facilitate more research on this problem
- Insights into the effects of data diversity and size on generalization of offline RL algorithms

The paper demonstrates limited generalization abilities of current offline RL methods, highlighting need for more research to improve performance on new environments not seen during training.
