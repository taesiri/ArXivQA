# [Neural Intrinsic Embedding for Non-rigid Point Cloud Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01038)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to establish correspondences between non-rigidly aligned point clouds. The key hypotheses are:

1. Learning an embedding that respects the intrinsic geometry of the underlying surface can help establish reliable correspondences between non-rigid shapes. 

2. Training the embedding network using relative geodesic errors and statistical distribution matching can improve local intrinsic geometry preservation.

3. Replacing handcrafted spectral embeddings with a learned embedding in a deep functional maps framework can lead to a simple yet effective pipeline for weakly supervised non-rigid point cloud matching.

4. The proposed pipeline is robust to common artifacts like noise and varying sampling density, and generalizes well even when trained on a small dataset.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a learned neural intrinsic embedding can enable effective non-rigid point cloud matching in a weakly supervised setting, while being robust and generalizable. The paper presents a method and experiments to validate these hypotheses.
