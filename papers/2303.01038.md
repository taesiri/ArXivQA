# [Neural Intrinsic Embedding for Non-rigid Point Cloud Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01038)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to establish correspondences between non-rigidly aligned point clouds. The key hypotheses are:

1. Learning an embedding that respects the intrinsic geometry of the underlying surface can help establish reliable correspondences between non-rigid shapes. 

2. Training the embedding network using relative geodesic errors and statistical distribution matching can improve local intrinsic geometry preservation.

3. Replacing handcrafted spectral embeddings with a learned embedding in a deep functional maps framework can lead to a simple yet effective pipeline for weakly supervised non-rigid point cloud matching.

4. The proposed pipeline is robust to common artifacts like noise and varying sampling density, and generalizes well even when trained on a small dataset.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a learned neural intrinsic embedding can enable effective non-rigid point cloud matching in a weakly supervised setting, while being robust and generalizable. The paper presents a method and experiments to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a learning-based framework called Neural Intrinsic Embedding (NIE) and Neural Intrinsic Mapping (NIM) for non-rigid point cloud matching. 

The key ideas are:

1. NIE embeds each point in a point cloud into a high-dimensional space that respects the intrinsic geometry of the underlying surface. It is trained to make the Euclidean distance between embeddings approximate the geodesic distance on the surface. 

2. NIM is a weakly supervised framework for non-rigid point cloud matching, built upon NIE. It learns to extract optimal features from input point clouds and estimate correspondences without ground truth correspondence labels.

3. The entire pipeline only requires point clouds that are rigidly aligned, along with geodesic distances for the training point clouds. It does not need triangulation or other structural information.

4. Experiments show the method achieves good matching performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, generalizes well, and is robust to noise and partiality. 

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective learning-based approach to leverage intrinsic geometry for non-rigid point cloud matching in a weakly supervised manner. The method is insensitive to point sampling density and robust to common artifacts.
