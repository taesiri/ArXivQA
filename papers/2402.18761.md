# [Exploration of Learned Lifting-Based Transform Structures for Fully   Scalable and Accessible Wavelet-Like Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18761)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Learned image compression methods typically use autoencoders, which lack resolution scalability, quality scalability, and region of interest accessibility that are beneficial features of wavelet codecs like JPEG2000. 
- Learned wavelet-like transforms aim to improve coding efficiency while retaining these useful features, by incorporating neural networks into the lifting steps of a wavelet transform. However, there has been limited study on the most effective way to do this.

Proposed Solution
- The paper systematically explores different arrangements of lifting steps (predict-update, update-predict, hybrid), number of learned lifting steps, and network architectures for the learned lifting operators.
- A "proposal-opacity" network topology is leveraged, comprised of linear proposals modulated by a shallow nonlinear subnetwork, giving good performance but limited complexity and region of support.
- Two robust training strategies are developed - an "oracle-opacity" pretraining method, and optimization with a backward annealing approach to handle discontinuous compression effects.

Main Contributions
- Demonstrates the benefit of augmenting a strong fixed wavelet transform with two additional learned lifting steps, rather than replacing all steps. This gives competitive performance with lower complexity.
- Shows the proposal-opacity network topology outperforms more traditional CNNs for this application. Increasing diversity (channels) further improves performance.   
- Provides guidance on effective network deployment to enhance wavelets for compression. Recommends a hybrid transform with compact proposal-opacity networks, balancing all considerations.
- Develops useful training strategies applicable to a variety of transform structures. Provides benchmarks on different configurations over diverse image datasets.
