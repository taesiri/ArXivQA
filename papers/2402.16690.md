# [ROVER: Risk-Aware Swarm Robotics MOtion Planner Using Conditional ValuE   at Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Swarm robotics has potential for complex cooperative tasks but faces challenges in scalability and safety when controlling large numbers of robots. 
- Existing methods have limitations in flexibility to navigate obstacles, computational efficiency, and ability to quantitatively manage risk.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a risk-aware swarm motion planning framework called ROVER using hierarchical planning and a novel risk metric.
- Represent macro-state of swarm with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), enabling flexibility and scalability.
- Formulate finite-time model predictive control (FTMPC) to generate safe trajectories by optimizing transport cost between consecutive distributions.
- Integrate conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraint measured on distance between swarm and obstacles to quantitatively bound collision risk.  
- Efficiently compute GMM-CVaR by linearizing signed distance function and sequential quadratic programming.

Main Contributions:
- Novel risk-aware planning architecture for swarm robotics with flexibility, scalability and adjustable risk levels.
- First application of GMM-CVaR for swarm systems and efficient online computation. 
- Validation in simulations demonstrating swarm safely navigating complex environments and splitting/merging.
- Comparisons show advantages over benchmarks in runtime, adaptability, risk modulation and 100s-1000s scale.

In summary, the paper proposes a new hierarchical planning approach called ROVER that leverages CVaR under GMM uncertainty for flexible, scalable and risk-controllable motion planning of swarm robots in complex environments. Key innovations enable the efficient integration and modulation of collision risk using GMM-CVaR for large swarm sizes.
