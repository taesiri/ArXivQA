## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training deep neural networks is challenging, requiring faster optimization algorithms to speed up training and enhance performance. 
- Existing adaptive optimization algorithms like Adam have non-convergence issues in some cases.
- There is still room for improvement in optimization algorithms for deep learning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new algorithm called CG-like Adam that incorporates a conjugate gradient-like direction into the Adam optimization method. 
- Specifically, both the first and second moment estimations in Adam are replaced with a scaled conjugate gradient direction to create the update direction.
- A convergence analysis is provided that handles cases with a constant exponential moving average coefficient and unbiased first moment estimation.

Main Contributions:
- A conjugate gradient-like direction is incorporated into Adam to create the CG-like Adam algorithm that leverages benefits of both conjugate gradient methods and adaptive moment estimation.
- Convergence guarantees are provided for non-convex objectives, covering challenging cases like constant averaging coefficients and unbiased momentum.  
- Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate faster and more stable training compared to Adam, along with improved test accuracy.
- The convergence analysis and experiments showcase the effectiveness of using a conjugate gradient-like direction in Adam for training deep neural networks.

In summary, the key innovation is integrating a scaled conjugate gradient-like direction into Adam to create the CG-like Adam algorithm with strong theoretical convergence properties and empirical performance for deep learning.
