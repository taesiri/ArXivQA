# [Learning Diverse Policies with Soft Self-Generated Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04539)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning Diverse Policies with Soft Self-Generated Guidance":

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) with sparse and deceptive rewards is challenging because non-zero rewards are rarely obtained. The gradient calculated by the agent can be stochastic and without valid information. Recent methods using memory buffers of previous experiences can improve learning efficiency, but they often require successful demonstrations and may overly exploit them. This can cause the agent to adopt suboptimal behaviors.

Method: 
The paper develops an approach that uses diverse past trajectories for faster and more efficient online RL, even if these trajectories are suboptimal or not highly rewarded. The key ideas are:

1) Policy Improvement (PI) Step: 
- Regard previous diverse trajectories as "guidance" instead of directly imitating them
- Guide agents to revisit regions where good trajectories are located by minimizing distance between state representations
- Allow flexibility in actions to visit novel states and find better policies

2) Policy Exploration (PE) Step:
- Introduce a new diversity measurement to drive agents to reach diverse parts of the state space 
- Maintain diversity of ensemble of agents to systematically explore state space

Main Contributions:

1) Novel two-step RL framework to utilize imperfect demonstrations for faster learning with sparse rewards 

2) First study showing importance of exploiting past experiences as guidance to drive exploration, instead of direct imitation

3) Method enables agents to efficiently reproduce diverse past trajectories, then smoothly expand beyond them towards optimality

4) New diversity metric introduced to maintain diversity of agent team and enhance exploration

5) Superior performance over RL methods on physical control tasks with sparse and deceptive rewards in terms of exploration and learning efficiency

In summary, the key insight is to use diverse past experiences as soft guidance, instead of direct imitation, along with a new diversity metric to systematically explore the state space. This results in more efficient learning in challenging RL problems with sparse rewards.
