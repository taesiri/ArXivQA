# [Efficient Sparse Least Absolute Deviation Regression with Differential   Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of robust and sparse linear regression under differential privacy constraints. Specifically, it considers a linear model with heavy-tailed errors and aims to estimate a sparse regression coefficient vector that is robust to outliers. However, existing differentially private regression methods either do not consider model robustness or have poor computational efficiency for non-smooth losses like the least absolute deviation (LAD) loss. Therefore, the paper aims to develop an efficient and privacy-preserving algorithm for sparse LAD regression that can handle heavy-tailed noises.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Fast Robust and Privacy-Preserving Estimation (FRAPPE) algorithm. The key ideas are:

1) Reformulate the sparse LAD problem as a penalized least squares problem through a pseudo-response transformation in the outer loop. This avoids directly optimizing the non-smooth LAD loss and enables faster computation. 

2) Guarantee differential privacy through three stages of noise injection: output perturbation for initialization, kernel density estimation noise, and gradient perturbation. Properly chosen noise scales ensure ($ε$, $δ$)-differential privacy.

3) Solve the reformulated least squares problem efficiently in the inner loop using proximal gradient descent with soft thresholding. Linear convergence rate is achieved.

Theoretical analysis shows that FRAPPE achieves near optimal statistical rate of $O(\sqrt{s\log p/N})$ as privacy budget grows, with a privacy-accuracy trade-off rate $O(\sqrt{p\log(1/\delta)\log(N\epsilon)}/(N \epsilon))$.

Main Contributions:

- First differentially private algorithm for sparse LAD regression with theoretical guarantee

- Achieves better trade-off between privacy protection and statistical accuracy compared to prior arts

- Computationally more efficient than subgradient methods for non-smooth LAD loss

- Robust to both light and heavy tailed noises unlike square loss based methods  

Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate superior performance of FRAPPE over state-of-the-art differentially private regression methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a fast and privacy-preserving algorithm called FRAPPE for robust sparse least absolute deviation regression that achieves near optimal statistical accuracy with differential privacy guarantees.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a fast and privacy-preserving algorithm called FRAPPE to solve the sparse robust regression problem with a least absolute deviation (LAD) loss and an L1 penalty. The key idea is to reformulate the non-smooth LAD loss as a smooth least squares loss using pseudo response variables. This allows the use of efficient proximal gradient methods.

2. It provides a theoretical analysis showing that with proper parameter selection, FRAPPE achieves near optimal statistical rates up to logarithmic factors, while guaranteeing ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differential privacy. Specifically, it establishes a trade-off between estimation accuracy and privacy.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrating that FRAPPE outperforms several state-of-the-art differentially private methods for sparse regression in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in the presence of heavy-tailed noises.

In summary, the main significance is developing a computationally efficient differentially private algorithm for robust sparse regression that enjoys excellent statistical accuracy. The proposed FRAPPE method is robust to heavy-tailed noises and outliers in the data.
