# [The Instinctive Bias: Spurious Images lead to Hallucination in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V have shown impressive performance on visual-textual tasks when images directly correspond to answers (factual images). 
- However, they fail dramatically when presented with images that are related but inconsistent with the correct answers (spurious images), suffering from hallucination and providing incorrect responses.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new benchmark called CorrelationQA with over 7K text-image pairs to quantify the degree of hallucination induced by spurious images.
- The benchmark contains questions across 13 categories, with factual and spurious images generated for each question using diffusion models and OCR techniques.

Key Contributions:
- Identified the "instinctive bias" issue where spurious images lead MLLMs to hallucinate and provide incorrect answers.  
- Proposed the first standardized benchmark CorrelationQA to evaluate model robustness to misleading images.
- Performed comprehensive analysis on 9 MLLMs, showing they universally suffer varying degrees of hallucination, with tangible categories like animals, plants being more problematic.
- Demonstrated that spurious images diminish reasoning capabilities of even powerful models like GPT-4V, indicating room for improvement in modality alignment strategies.

In summary, the paper identifies and quantifies the instinctive bias causing hallucination in MLLMs under spurious images, providing the analysis and resources to further progress on this important robustness issue.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies and quantifies the instinctive bias in multi-modal large language models when presented with spurious images that are related but inconsistent with correct answers, leading the models to hallucinate incorrect responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It identifies the visual instinctive bias in MLLMs, where spurious visual inputs can cause current MLLMs to hallucinate. 

2) It proposes a new benchmark called CorrelationQA to quantify the seriousness of instinctive bias across different types, demonstrating that this issue is universal across MLLMs.

3) It provides an in-depth analysis of 9 recent representative MLLMs on the proposed benchmark, showing their susceptibility to spurious visual inputs under different scenarios.

In summary, this paper proposes a new benchmark and evaluation methodology to assess MLLMs' robustness to misleading images, identifies the instinctive bias issue, and analyzes the susceptibility of current MLLMs. The key contribution is revealing and quantifying this previously under-explored problem with spurious visual inputs causing hallucinations in MLLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
- Hallucination 
- Instinctive bias
- Spurious images
- Factual images 
- Commonsense question answering (CQA)
- Visual question answering (VQA)
- Proposed benchmark called CorrelationQA
- Accuracy metrics like successful answer rate and accuracy drop
- Analysis of mainstream MLLMs like GPT-4V and LLaVA
- Identification of categories where models struggle more with spurious images (e.g. animals, plants)
- Comparison of natural images vs typography images in terms of inducing hallucination
- Discussion of training strategies to improve model robustness

The main focus seems to be on analyzing how current MLLMs tend to hallucinate or provide incorrect answers when presented with images that are related but inconsistent with the actual answers, especially for commonsense QA tasks. The key contribution is the proposed CorrelationQA benchmark to quantify this "instinctive bias" towards misleading images across different MLLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an automated pipeline to generate the image-text benchmark. Can you explain in detail the 3 key steps in this pipeline and how they enable collecting a large-scale benchmark efficiently? 

2. The paper leverages GPT-4 to generate the initial text pairs. Why is GPT-4 well-suited for this task compared to other language models? What modifications or constraints were imposed in the prompting to generate high-quality QA pairs?

3. Stable Diffusion is used as the image generator in the pipeline. What are some key advantages of Stable Diffusion that make it well-suited for generating both factual and spurious images in this context?

4. Two types of images - natural and typography are generated in the paper. Can you outline the motivation and methodology behind generating both varieties? What differences would you expect in how models perceive and process these two image types?  

5. The paper proposes two new evaluation metrics - Accuracy Drop and Accuracy Decline Ratio. Explain their definitions, and what aspects of model performance they aim to capture. How do they differ from simply using accuracy?

6. In the experiments, category-wise differences were observed in terms of model accuracy drop. What underlying factors might explain why certain categories like animals, plants etc. saw a higher drop compared to history, art etc?

7. The observations indicate typography images had a more detrimental impact on models than natural images. Intuitively explain what might lead to this difference in model sensitivity. 

8. Qualitative analysis revealed models were sensitive to images with tangible/recognizable objects. Why might this be the case? Does this indicate a limitation in how models perceive images?

9. Could the proposed benchmark be expanded to include other modalities like audio, video etc? What challenges might arise in generating misleading inputs in those modalities?

10. The findings reveal instinctive bias is an unsolved issue across MLLMs. What are some potential ways this problem could be addressed via model architecture changes or training procedures?
