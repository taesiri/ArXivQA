# [How Do Large Language Models Capture the Ever-changing World Knowledge?
  A Review of Recent Advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07343)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we align large language models (LLMs) with the ever-changing world knowledge efficiently and effectively, without needing to re-train the model from scratch?

The key hypotheses or assumptions underlying this research question appear to be:

- LLMs implicitly store a lot of world knowledge in their parameters after pre-training on large corpora. However, this knowledge can quickly become outdated as the world changes dynamically.

- Retraining LLMs from scratch to realign them with updated world knowledge is infeasible due to the prohibitive computational costs. 

- There is potential to efficiently adapt LLMs to stay aligned with changing world knowledge, by either implicitly modifying the knowledge stored in the parameters or explicitly augmenting the LLM with external knowledge sources.

- Methods that can achieve this alignment without full retraining may involve techniques like knowledge editing, continual learning, memory augmentation, retrieval augmentation, or leveraging internet knowledge.

So in summary, the central research question is around how to keep deployed LLMs up-to-date with world knowledge changes efficiently, without full retraining, via implicit or explicit alignment techniques. The key hypothesis seems to be that such efficient alignment is possible.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions, including:

- Developing more robust and efficient knowledge editing methods. They point out challenges such as updating various types of knowledge beyond just relational facts, identifying what knowledge needs updating, understanding the internal memorization mechanisms of LLMs, improving knowledge propagation and generalization after editing, and enabling large-scale and continual knowledge editing efficiently.

- Exploring efficient continual learning methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with the dynamic world. Very little work has looked at using continual learning to keep LLMs up-to-date, and it remains challenging to do this without forgetting general knowledge required for downstream tasks.

- Addressing knowledge conflicts that can arise both from implicit editing methods as well as when retrieval provides contradictory information to the LLM's internal knowledge. More research is needed on detecting and reconciling such conflicts.

- Developing more efficient retrieval and memory management methods to reduce computational overhead during inference when using explicit alignment approaches. This includes selective retrieval, efficient memory usage, and handling long retrieved contexts.

- Creating comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and quantitative comparisons to evaluate different methods on their ability to align LLMs to changing world knowledge. Existing benchmarks are limited and often test methods in narrow or synthetic settings.

- Exploring the use of real-time evaluation benchmarks that can capture the dynamic nature of world knowledge, as opposed to static benchmarks.

In summary, key challenges involve scaling up knowledge editing, enabling continual learning for LLMs, handling knowledge conflicts, improving efficiency of external knowledge incorporation, and better evaluation methodologies. Addressing these could significantly advance the ability to keep deployed LLMs up-to-date.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in aligning large language models (LLMs) with the ever-changing world knowledge without re-training the models from scratch. The authors categorize the approaches into implicit methods that directly modify the knowledge stored in the LLM's parameters, and explicit methods that leverage external resources to override the LLM's outdated internal knowledge. 

Implicit methods include knowledge editing techniques like meta-learning, hypernetwork editors, and locate-and-edit methods that identify and modify specific parameters corresponding to certain facts. Continual learning methods are also discussed that enable LLMs to continuously learn from new data streams while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Explicit methods utilize external memory, retrievers, and internet tools to provide up-to-date information to guide the LLM's generation. Detailed comparisons and future challenges are discussed. The paper provides useful categorization and analysis of emerging techniques to keep deployed LLMs aligned with real-world knowledge without costly re-training, though comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are still lacking.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with the ever-changing world knowledge without requiring full retraining of the model. The key idea is to leverage continual learning techniques to enable the LLM to incrementally acquire new knowledge over time from a stream of data. Specifically, the method employs a multi-task learning framework where the LLM has a shared encoder and separate task-specific output heads. When new data for a task arrives, only the parameters of the corresponding head are updated via gradient descent while the shared encoder is regularized to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. This allows efficiently adapting the LLM to new data and knowledge without impacting abilities on existing data. The approach does not modify the original pretrained weights, avoiding side effects, and does not need access to previous datasets, making it suitable for a continually evolving data stream. Experiments across multiple language modeling datasets demonstrate that the method can effectively acquire new knowledge while retaining competitively high performance on the original knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is reviewing recent advances in aligning large language models (LLMs) with the ever-changing world knowledge without re-training the models from scratch. The key problem it addresses is that LLMs become outdated quickly after deployment as the world knowledge they were trained on becomes obsolete, yet re-training them with updated knowledge is infeasible due to computational costs. The main question is how to efficiently and effectively keep deployed LLMs up-to-date with new world knowledge.

The key points are:

- LLMs implicitly store a lot of world knowledge in their parameters from pre-training. However, this knowledge can quickly become outdated after deployment.

- Naively re-training LLMs with updated data is costly and impractical. More efficient methods are needed to update LLMs.

- The paper categorizes methods into "implicit" ones that directly update the model's internal parameters vs "explicit" ones that override the model's outputs using external knowledge.

- Implicit methods include knowledge editing (locating and editing specific parameters) and continual learning (ongoing training on new data streams). 

- Explicit methods use external memory stores, retrievers, or internet to provide up-to-date knowledge.

- The paper comprehensively surveys and compares recent advances in both implicit and explicit methods for updating LLMs efficiently without full re-training.

In summary, the paper provides a systematic review of techniques to align large deployed LLMs with changing world knowledge, which is an important open problem. The categorization and comparison of methods provides a useful framework to understand this emerging research area.
