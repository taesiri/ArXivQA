# [Safety Filters for Black-Box Dynamical Systems by Learning   Discriminating Hyperplanes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Safety assurance for control of uncertain and unknown dynamical systems remains a challenge, especially for learning-based methods like reinforcement learning (RL). Existing methods rely on learning certificate functions like Control Barrier Functions or Hamilton-Jacobi value functions to derive safety constraints and safe domains.

- The key insight is that ultimately enforcing safety constraints on the control input is what guarantees safety. So rather than relying on specific certificate function forms, the paper focuses directly on the safety constraint.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the notion of a "discriminating hyperplane" which parametrizes a half-space safety constraint on the control input at each state. Satisfying this constraint is sufficient for safety.

- The discriminating hyperplane generalizes and unifies safety constraints used in control barrier functions, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, etc. But it eliminates dependence on specific certificate function forms.

- Two methods are presented to learn the parameters of the discriminating hyperplane from data:
   1) Supervised learning using control invariant sets to generate labels 
   2) Reinforcement learning to directly optimize safety constraint satisfaction

- The learned discriminating hyperplane can then be used in a safety filter that projects unsafe control inputs onto the safety constraint half-space.

Contributions:
- Formalizes the notion of a discriminating hyperplane safety constraint and proves it is sufficient for control invariance.

- Offers a more general perspective for designing safety filters based directly on control input constraints rather than certificate functions.

- Demonstrates supervised learning and RL methods to learn the discriminating hyperplane from trajectory data.

- Shows experimentally that the safety filter effectively keeps a variety of dynamical systems safe using the learned hyperplane.

In summary, the paper presents a novel sufficient condition for safety (discriminating hyperplane) and learning-based methods to construct safety filters without relying on certificate functions or accurate models.
