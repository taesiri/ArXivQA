# [How much informative is your XAI? A decision-making assessment task to   objectively measure the goodness of explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04379)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively measure the "goodness" of explainable AI (XAI) systems by determining their information power - the amount of useful information they provide to users. The task involves non-expert users interacting with an AI system in a simulated decision-making scenario about which they have no prior knowledge. Through asking the AI "what" and "why" questions, users aim to understand the goals, rules, and environment dynamics. Measures include user performance, understanding of rules, ability to generalize, satisfaction, and perceptions. By comparing measures between different XAI methods, the task can determine which provides more useful information to users. The authors plan to apply this generalizable assessment framework to compare classical vs user-aware XAI techniques in a human-robot interaction nuclear plant simulation. Overall, this presents an objective way to evaluate and compare XAI systems based on their core purpose - informing users.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively measure the goodness (information power) of explainable AI systems through user interaction during a decision-making task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively measure the goodness of explainable AI (XAI) systems in terms of their "information power". Specifically:

- The paper argues that previous works have assessed the goodness of XAI systems using indirect or subjective measures, rather than directly measuring how much information/knowledge the systems provide to users. 

- The proposed assessment task involves non-expert users interacting with an AI system (e.g. a robot) in a decision-making task, with the aim of discovering the rules and goals behind the task. 

- Users can ask the AI "what" action it would take and "why", with the AI's explanations constituting its XAI system. 

- The information power of the XAI system is quantified based on how many task rules users are able to learn through interacting with the system. This provides an objective measure of the goodness of the XAI.

- The task is designed to be generalizable to other types of decision-making tasks and AI/XAI systems. 

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel assessment task to directly and objectively measure the information power of XAI systems as an indication of their goodness.

The paper proposes an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively measure the "goodness" of XAI systems in terms of their information power - the amount of information they provide to users. It aims to compare two XAI techniques (classical vs user-aware) in a human-robot decision-making scenario and measure how informative they are for non-expert users. Concepts like mental models, counterfactual explanations, transparency, and generalizability also feature prominently.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an assessment task to measure the "information power" of an XAI system. What exactly is meant by information power and why is it an important metric to measure? 

2. The assessment task involves non-expert users interacting with an AI system in a decision-making simulation. What are the key requirements and characteristics of this simulation environment? How could it be generalized to other applications?

3. The paper distinguishes between "what" and "why" questions that users can ask the AI system. What is the purpose of each type of question and how do the system's responses differ? 

4. Two XAI strategies are compared - a "classical" approach and a "user-aware" approach. What are the key differences between these strategies in terms of explanation selection and tailoring responses to the user?

5. The formula provided for calculating the "information power" of the AI system has several components. Walk through each component and explain its meaning and role in the overall metric.  

6. Various quantitative and subjective measures are collected during the assessment task. What is the purpose of each set of measures? How could additional measures provide further insight?

7. What are some of the unique properties of this assessment task compared to other XAI evaluation methods? What novel capabilities does it enable?

8. One goal is to objectively compare XAI techniques regardless of the application context. What aspects of this method allow it to generalize across contexts? What constraints remain?

9. How could this assessment procedure be validated? What experiments could determine if it accurately measures the information power of an XAI system? 

10. The task involves interactions between users and a social robot. What opportunities and challenges arise from embedding the XAI system in a social robot rather than a more basic interface?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of objective and quantitative measures to evaluate the goodness of explainable AI (XAI) systems. Most evaluations rely on indirect or subjective measures like questionnaires or performance. 
- It is difficult to compare different XAI techniques rigorously since evaluations are tied to specific application contexts.
- The core purpose of an XAI system - to provide useful information about an AI model's functioning - has not been directly measured.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a decision-making task to objectively measure the "information power" of an XAI system, defined as the amount of new knowledge about the AI system gained by users through interaction.
- Task requires non-expert users to interact with an expert AI agent and XAI system to uncover rules and goals, starting with no prior knowledge.
- Interaction allows users to query the AI for action suggestions ("what") and explanations ("why"). 
- Information power is quantified based on features of environment, number of rules learned per feature, and accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- A novel assessment task to directly quantify how informative XAI systems are to non-expert users.
- Allows comparing different XAI techniques independent of application area.
- Can be generalized to other decision-making tasks that enable iterative user interaction.
- Test case of simulated nuclear reactor environment, decision tree expert agent, classical vs user-aware explanation techniques.
- Outlines experimental measures like performance, understanding, satisfaction to supplement information power.
