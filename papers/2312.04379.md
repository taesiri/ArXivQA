# [How much informative is your XAI? A decision-making assessment task to   objectively measure the goodness of explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04379)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively measure the "goodness" of explainable AI (XAI) systems by determining their information power - the amount of useful information they provide to users. The task involves non-expert users interacting with an AI system in a simulated decision-making scenario about which they have no prior knowledge. Through asking the AI "what" and "why" questions, users aim to understand the goals, rules, and environment dynamics. Measures include user performance, understanding of rules, ability to generalize, satisfaction, and perceptions. By comparing measures between different XAI methods, the task can determine which provides more useful information to users. The authors plan to apply this generalizable assessment framework to compare classical vs user-aware XAI techniques in a human-robot interaction nuclear plant simulation. Overall, this presents an objective way to evaluate and compare XAI systems based on their core purpose - informing users.
