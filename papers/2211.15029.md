# [DiffusionBERT: Improving Generative Masked Language Models with   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15029)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively combine diffusion models with pre-trained language models (PLMs) for improving non-autoregressive text generation. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) PLMs can serve as a good initialization for learning the reverse diffusion process due to their pre-training objectives being related to denoising. This can help accelerate convergence and improve generation quality.

2) Designing a new noise schedule tailored for text data that distributes corrupted information uniformly across diffusion steps can further improve the generation performance. 

3) Throwing away explicit time step information and having the model perform time-agnostic decoding aligns better with PLMs and works better than explicitly incorporating time steps.

In summary, the main goal is to elucidate techniques to successfully integrate diffusion models with PLMs to get the benefits of both approaches for non-autoregressive text generation. The key hypotheses focus on noise schedule designs and time step handling to make diffusion models compatible with PLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Presenting DiffusionBERT, a new generative masked language model based on discrete diffusion models. 

- Combining diffusion models and pre-trained language models (PLMs) to leverage the strengths of both approaches. PLMs provide good initialization and help accelerate convergence, while diffusion models offer a promising training strategy to improve generation quality.

- Proposing two key components of DiffusionBERT:
    - A new noise schedule called spindle schedule that controls the degree of noise based on each token's information. More informative tokens are masked later in the forward diffusion process.
    - Exploring different ways to incorporate the timestep into PLMs, finding that time-agnostic decoding works best.

- Demonstrating superior performance of DiffusionBERT over previous diffusion models and generative masked LMs on unconditional text generation. DiffusionBERT achieves significantly lower perplexity and higher BLEU score.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting DiffusionBERT which combines the strengths of diffusion models and PLMs through novel designs like the spindle schedule and time-agnostic decoding. Experiments show DiffusionBERT substantially improves text generation quality over previous approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents DiffusionBERT, a new generative masked language model that combines discrete diffusion models with BERT to improve text generation quality by leveraging BERT's pre-training and proposing a new noise schedule and time-agnostic decoding approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on diffusion models and non-autoregressive text generation:

- This paper proposes combining pretrained language models (like BERT) with diffusion models for text generation. Most prior work on diffusion models for text does not leverage pretrained models. The use of BERT as the backbone model is a novel contribution.

- The paper explores discrete diffusion models rather than continuous diffusion models that have been more commonly used for text. The authors argue discrete diffusion is more suitable when combining with pretrained masked language models like BERT.

- The proposed "spindle noise schedule" is a new way of controlling the noise schedule in discrete diffusion models based on token frequency. This is different from prior schedules like linear or cosine decay.

- For incorporating time steps, the paper finds "time-agnostic decoding" works best by not explicitly conditioning on time. Other papers usually input an embedding for time steps.

- The proposed DiffusionBERT achieves state-of-the-art results for non-autoregressive text generation on perplexity and BLEU. It pushes the quality-diversity Pareto front compared to prior non-autoregressive methods.

- DiffusionBERT is not compared directly to autoregressive models. The quality-diversity tradeoff is still better for autoregressive models like GPT-2. Combining diffusion models and pretrained autoregressive LMs could be an interesting direction.

In summary, the main novelties are the combination with pretrained models, the discrete diffusion process, and innovations like the spindle noise schedule and time-agnostic decoding. The results demonstrate the promise of this approach for improving non-autoregressive text generation. Comparisons to autoregressive models would also be insightful future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions at the end of the paper:

- Explore other noise schedules beyond the proposed spindle schedule, such as learned schedules like the recent s-shaped schedule in the image domain. 

- Investigate different model architectures as the backbone instead of BERT. The proposed techniques are generic and could be applied to other masked language models.

- Combine the proposed techniques with continuous diffusion models to enjoy the benefits of both discrete and continuous modeling of text.

- Apply the proposed DiffusionBERT to conditional text generation tasks such as dialogue, summarization, and translation. The absorbing state can be task-specific tokens instead of [MASK].

- Conduct theoretical analysis on the effect of different noise schedules on the convergence and sample quality. Derive the optimal schedule for discrete diffusion processes.

- Explore wider applications of the proposed time-agnostic decoding, which removes the need for specialized time step modeling.

In summary, the main future directions are to explore better noise schedules, apply the techniques to other models and tasks, analyze diffusion processes theoretically, and investigate the broader impact of the time-agnostic decoding technique. The authors provide a promising new direction in combining diffusion models and PLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents DiffusionBERT, a new generative masked language model that combines diffusion models with pre-trained language models like BERT. The key ideas are: 1) Using BERT as the backbone model to learn the reverse diffusion process, leveraging its pre-training for faster convergence and better text generation compared to training a model from scratch. 2) Proposing a new "spindle" noise schedule for the forward diffusion process that masks tokens based on their frequency, encouraging easier tokens to be generated first. 3) Investigating different ways to incorporate the diffusion timestep into BERT, finding the best results occur when discarding the timestep completely during decoding (time-agnostic decoding). Experiments on unconditional text generation show DiffusionBERT significantly outperforms prior diffusion models and BERT-based generative models in terms of perplexity and BLEU score. The proposed spindle schedule and time-agnostic decoding are shown to provide gains through ablation studies. Overall, DiffusionBERT demonstrates the benefit of combining diffusion models and pre-trained language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents DiffusionBERT, a new generative masked language model based on discrete diffusion models. Diffusion models and many pre-trained language models share a denoising training objective, allowing DiffusionBERT to combine the benefits of both approaches. Diffusion models provide a promising training strategy to improve generation quality, while pre-trained denoising models like BERT serve as a good initialization to accelerate convergence. 

The authors propose two key improvements to DiffusionBERT. First, they introduce a new noise schedule called the spindle schedule that controls the degree of noise added at each diffusion step based on token frequency information. Second, they investigate different ways to incorporate the diffusion time step into BERT, finding the best results with time-agnostic decoding that does not explicitly use the time step. Experiments on unconditional text generation show DiffusionBERT significantly outperforms existing diffusion models and generative BERT models in terms of perplexity and BLEU score. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed spindle schedule and time-agnostic decoding. Overall, DiffusionBERT effectively integrates diffusion models and pre-trained language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
