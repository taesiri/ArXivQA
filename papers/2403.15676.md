# [AC4: Algebraic Computation Checker for Circuit Constraints in ZKPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Zero knowledge proof (ZKP) systems are widely used for security and privacy in applications like blockchains and cryptocurrencies. 
- ZKP systems are often implemented using arithmetic circuits and zk-SNARK protocols. However, bugs can occur in these arithmetic circuits:
  - Underconstrained circuits: Multiple outputs can satisfy constraints for the same input, allowing fake witnesses and security issues.  
  - Overconstrained circuits: No outputs can satisfy constraints, causing denial of service.
- Existing methods using SMT solvers struggle with efficiency and scalability in verifying large circuits.

Proposed Solution:
- Model ZKP circuit constraints as quadratic equation systems over finite fields. Categorize circuits based on maximum degree of equations.
- Apply specialized algebraic computation techniques tailored to each category:
  - Precisely linear circuits: Solve with Gaussian Jordan method.
  - K-coefficient linear circuits: Treat as linear using heuristics to handle special inputs.  
  - Quadratic circuits: Identify inputs causing underconstrained states using frequency table and substitution. Directly solve if needed.
- Implement solution as a tool called AC^4 with parsers, categorizers, solvers and optimizations.

Contributions:
- Formalized ZKP circuit verification as an algebraic problem of determining number of solutions to polynomial systems.
- Proposed categorization-based framework with tailored verification algorithms per category.  
- Developed AC^4 tool realizing the algebraic computation approach, with 29% more benchmarks solved than prior work.
- Evaluation showed AC^4 solved 89% of 176 real-world Circom circuits. Checking time improved orders of magnitude over SMT-based methods.

In summary, the paper introduces an algebraic computation approach for ZKP circuit verification that is more efficient and scalable than prior SMT-based techniques. By modeling and categorizing circuits appropriately, specialized solvers can be applied for enhanced performance.
