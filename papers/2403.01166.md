# [DINER: Debiasing Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Multi-variable   Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to classify the sentiment polarity towards a target aspect in a review. 
- Though neural models have made progress, they are not robust and fail on simple data transformations like reversing target polarity.
- This is because models exploit biases and spurious correlations in the training data instead of learning the true underlying task.
- There are two types of biases in ABSA - (1) direct correlation between aspect and label (2) indirect confounding between context and review.  
- Existing debiasing methods using causal inference handle single variable bias and cannot mitigate both aspect and review bias simultaneously.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called DINER based on multi-variable causal inference to debias both aspect and review.
- It uses a Structural Causal Model (SCM) with aspect, review, context, knowledge and label as variables. 
- The desired unbiased prediction is modeled as the total indirect effect from aspect and review on label.
- For the review branch, backdoor adjustment intervention is used to remove confounding of context on review.  
- For the aspect branch, counterfactual reasoning intervention is used to eliminate direct correlation between aspect and label.
- The framework has separate losses for a fused branch, debiased review branch and aspect branch.

Main Contributions:
- First work to analyze ABSA bias using multi-variable causal inference and propose debiasing based on it.  
- A hybrid causal intervention method combining backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning tailored to ABSA.
- Comprehensive evaluation showing state-of-the-art performance compared to normal ABSA methods and debiasing methods.
- The framework is model-agnostic and shown to be effective with BERT and RoBERTa backbones.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in analyzing and mitigating both review and aspect biases in ABSA using multi-variable causal inference. The proposed DINER framework with hybrid interventions outperforms previous debiasing methods.
