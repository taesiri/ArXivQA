# [Neural Network Training on Encrypted Data with TFHE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Training neural networks (NNs) requires large amounts of data which is expensive to obtain and annotate. Data owners want to protect their data confidentiality when training NNs on third party servers. 

- Existing solutions like federated learning require active client participation and don't work directly on encrypted data. They also have complexity in handling vertically partitioned data from multiple parties.

Proposed Solution
- The paper presents a unified approach to outsource NN training on encrypted data using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). 

- It works for both horizontally and vertically partitioned data from multiple parties. The same solution works irrespective of whether the data comes from a single or multiple parties.

- They use the FHE scheme TFHE to train quantized NNs end-to-end on encrypted data without any leakage. 

Key Technical Points
- They represent the NN computation graph in PyTorch, optimize and quantify it using plaintexts and then compile it to work directly on encrypted data.

- The compilation cleverly breaks down the graph into partitions, generates optimized FHE parameters for each partition and fuses chained floating point operations into integer lookup tables that work with TFHE.

- They introduce a TFHE rounding operator to reduce accumulated noise and fit the bit-widths to the quantization scaling factors. This makes the solution efficient.

Results
- The method is demonstrated by training logistic regression and MLPs on 2 datasets. Using 4-bit quantization, the accuracy matches that of floating point training on plaintexts.

- The training throughput is optimized to be faster than prior arts in encrypted NN training. For e.g. on MLPs, it attains 3x higher throughput than state-of-the-art solutions.

To summarize, the paper presents a novel, efficient and unified solution for outsourced quantized NN training on encrypted data from multiple parties while preserving data confidentiality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an approach to train quantized neural network models on encrypted data using fully homomorphic encryption, enabling collaborative machine learning on confidential data while preserving privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be presenting a unified approach for training neural networks on encrypted data using fully homomorphic encryption. Specifically:

- They show how to train logistic regression and multi-layer perceptrons on encrypted data using integer quantization and TFHE's rounding operator to reduce latency. 

- Their approach works for both horizontally and vertically partitioned data from multiple parties, enabling collaborative training on confidential data.

- They demonstrate their method on a couple of datasets, training models to accuracies comparable to training on plaintext data.

So in summary, the key contribution is enabling practical encrypted training of neural networks in a generic way that handles multiple data partitioning scenarios and reduces training latency via quantization and the new TFHE rounding operator.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using ONNX to represent the computation graph for training. What are some of the advantages of using ONNX over other frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch when targeting compilation to lower-level representations?

2. The quantization process described seems to rely on an offline calibration step on plaintext data. What are some challenges when trying to do effective quantization directly on encrypted data? How might the accuracy results differ?

3. What tradeoffs need to be considered when partitioning the computation graph into subgraphs for compilation? For example, what impact does the partitioning have on depth versus parallelism of operations?

4. The paper argues that their approach works for both horizontally and vertically partitioned data. What modifications would need to be made to effectively handle data that is both horizontally and vertically partitioned across parties?

5. How does the noise growth in the ciphertexts impact the rounding operator approach over successive mini-batches? Is there an accuracy or training time tradeoff compared to bootstrapping weights between batches?

6. How does the mini-batch size impact latency and accuracy results for this encrypted training approach? What may be some ideal batch sizes to use?  

7. What custom optimizations could potentially speed up the matrix multiplications performed in the neural network layers during encrypted computation?

8. How does accuracy and model convergence speed compare when using different gradient descent optimization algorithms like SGD, momentum, or Adam in the encrypted training?

9. What would be required to train larger convolutional neural network architectures with this TFHE-based approach? What accuracy or latency differences may result?

10. Could the fixed quantization scheme used still achieve high accuracy when training very deep models, or would more sophisticated quantization be required?
