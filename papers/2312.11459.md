# [VolumeDiffusion: Flexible Text-to-3D Generation with Efficient   Volumetric Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating 3D objects from text prompts is a challenging task. The key issues are:
1) Lack of efficient 3D representation to capture both geometry and texture details that is also flexible for fine-grained text control.
2) Lack of large-scale text-3D data to train generative models.

Proposed Solution:
1) Novel volumetric representation: Uses a feature volume to represent both geometry and texture details. A lightweight network efficiently acquires volumes from multi-view images, allowing large-scale data generation. The localized representation allows flexible text control over object parts.

2) Text-conditioned diffusion model: Learns the distribution of volumes using a 3D U-Net conditioned on CLIP text embeddings. Carefully handles inaccurate captions in datasets via proposed data filtering. Addresses high dimensionality of volumes via new noise schedule and low-frequency noise strategy during training.

3) Refinement using Score Distillation Sampling: Leverages text-to-image models to refine details in volumes generated by the diffusion model.

Main Contributions:
1) Efficient volumetric representation for scalable text-3D data generation and flexible text control.

2) Text-conditioned diffusion modeling techniques tailored for high-dimensional spaces.

3) State-of-the-art text-to-3D generation results on Objaverse dataset, with superior fine-grained text control over object parts compared to existing methods.

4) Overall framework combining volume encoding, diffusion modeling and refinement that pushes progress in flexible and controllable text-to-3D generation.
