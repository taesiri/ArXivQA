# [CAD: Photorealistic 3D Generation via Adversarial Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06663)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes CAD, a novel framework for generating photorealistic and diverse 3D objects conditioned on a single image and text prompt. The key idea is to train a 3D generator network that directly models the conditional distribution of a pretrained diffusion model through adversarial learning. In contrast to prior score distillation methods like DreamFusion and ProlificDreamer that optimize a single 3D representation and often exhibit issues like over-smoothing, CAD avoids degraded quality from mode-seeking by matching distributions. To address sampling bias in diffusion models towards frontal views, the authors employ a view-dependent model and propose pruning strategies to filter bad samples. The refined multi-view priors are then used to perform adversarial distillation into the 3D network. A patch-based objective ensures high-quality details and multiview consistency. Experiments demonstrate CAD's advantage over strong baselines like Magic123 in photorealism, quality and diversity. By modeling distributions rather than modes, it facilitates applications like reconstruction, interpolation and flexible sampling. The proposed adversarial distillation paradigm sets a new state-of-the-art for single image guided 3D synthesis.
