# [KF-PLS: Optimizing Kernel Partial Least-Squares (K-PLS) with Kernel   Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06547)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a methodology for optimizing the kernel parameters in Kernel Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) using a technique called Kernel Flows (KF). K-PLS is a nonlinear extension of Partial Least Squares regression that projects data into a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in order to model nonlinear relationships. The proposed KF-PLS method optimizes the kernel parameters by minimizing a loss function obtained through cross-validation on random data subsets. It allows learning the type of kernel and its parameters directly from the data. The effectiveness of KF-PLS is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world data from nonlinear regression and classification tasks in four case studies. The optimized KF-PLS is shown to outperform regular PLS and unoptimized K-PLS in terms of accuracy, RMSE, and predictive ability ($Q^2$). Additional contributions include introducing kernel combinations to K-PLS and studying the effects of various factors like noise, number of latent variables, kernel initialization, and data scaling on model performance. Overall, the proposed methodology successfully enhances K-PLS by enabling automated learning of optimal kernels tailored for the data.
