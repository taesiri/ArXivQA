# [CONCSS: Contrastive-based Context Comprehension for Dialogue-appropriate   Prosody in Conversational Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10358)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational speech synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with dialogue-appropriate prosody by incorporating historical dialogues as context. 
- However, current CSS methods have limitations in effectively representing and comprehending the context to produce context-sensitive and distinguishable prosody. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel CSS framework called CONCSS that integrates contrastive learning to enhance context understanding and representation. 
- A context-aware contrastive learning module is introduced with a novel pretext task specific to CSS and a hard negative sampling strategy. This forces the model to learn discernible context representations.
- An autoregressive prosodic modeling module is used to model fluent prosody.

Main Contributions:
1) First work to adopt contrastive learning for CSS to address context comprehension in a self-supervised manner.
2) Designs a CSS-specific pretext task and sampling strategy to obtain context-sensitive vectors.
3) Comprehensively evaluates models on producing context-appropriate prosody when exposed to diverse contexts.
4) Achieves improved performance over previous CSS methods in both subjective and objective metrics. The model produces more natural and context-sensitive prosody.

In summary, the paper presents a novel contrastive learning-based framework CONCSS for conversational speech synthesis to improve context understanding and sensitivity. Both ablation studies and comparative experiments verify its effectiveness.
