# [Think from Words(TFW): Initiating Human-Like Cognition in Large Language   Models Through Think from Words for Japanese Text-level Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03458)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces two novel methods - Think from Words (TFW) and TFW with Extra word-level information (TFW Extra) - aimed at enhancing large language models' (LLMs) ability to comprehend texts similarly to human cognition. The core premise is that comprehending the overall meaning of a text requires first understanding individual words within it. The TFW method prompts LLMs to initially generate word-level classification label-span pairs from a text, then synthesize these to determine the text's overall classification. Experiments using Japanese text classification datasets reveal TFW outperforms baseline methods in most cases. Further analysis shows LLMs, like humans, weigh sentiment adjectives more heavily in determining overall text sentiment polarity. However, added word-level information causes drastic declines in accuracy for sentiment analysis tasks, indicating LLMs can misinterpret certain word-level data in ways incongruous with human judgment. Findings validate LLMs can initiate comprehension from the word level akin to human reading practices. Key limitations include restricted dataset availability and model choice constraints. Overall, this work sheds light on bridging the gap between LLM and human-like thinking through foundational word-level understanding.
