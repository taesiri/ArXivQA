# [Shortcut-V2V: Compression Framework for Video-to-Video Translation based   on Temporal Redundancy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08011)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve the computational efficiency of video-to-video translation models while maintaining good performance?

The key hypothesis proposed is that:

By exploiting temporal redundancy between video frames and adaptively blending features from neighboring frames, we can approximate the features of the current frame using much fewer computations compared to running the full model, thereby improving efficiency.

In particular, the paper introduces a framework called Shortcut-V2V that:

1) Avoids redundant computations for nearby frames by predicting the intermediate features of the current frame based on features from the previous frame.

2) Uses a novel Adaptive Blending and Deformation (AdaBD) block to blend and deform features from adjacent frames in a lightweight manner to enable more accurate approximation of the current frame features.

The overall goal is to significantly reduce the computational costs and memory usage of video-to-video translation models during inference while preserving the original model performance as much as possible. Experiments on various models and datasets demonstrate 3.2-5.7x savings in computations and 7.8-44x savings in parameters with Shortcut-V2V.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a new general-purpose model compression framework called Shortcut-V2V for video-to-video translation. This framework reduces redundant computations between video frames by approximating intermediate features of the current frame using features from the previous frame.

2. Introducing a new block called AdaBD (Adaptive Blending and Deformation block) that adaptively blends and deforms features from neighboring frames to enable more accurate approximation of intermediate features.

3. Demonstrating the general applicability of the proposed framework by conducting experiments with different well-known video-to-video translation models on various tasks. The results show comparable performance to the original models while reducing computational cost by 3.2-5.7x and memory usage by 7.8-44x.

4. Providing the first general-purpose model compression approach for video-to-video translation, to the best of their knowledge. The method is shown to outperform existing compression techniques designed for image translation or a specific video translation model.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel general framework for compressing video-to-video translation models to improve efficiency, enabled by a new technique to approximate intermediate features using adaptive blending/deformation of temporally neighboring features.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Shortcut-V2V, a general framework to improve the efficiency of video-to-video translation models by approximating intermediate features of the current frame using the previous frame's features and adaptively blending them via a new Adaptive Blending and Deformation block.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper on video-to-video translation model compression compares to other related research:

- This is the first paper to propose a general-purpose compression framework, Shortcut-V2V, that can improve efficiency for diverse video-to-video translation models. Previous compression methods like Fast-Vid2Vid are model-specific.

- The paper introduces a new Adaptive Blending and Deformation (AdaBD) block that enables lightweight approximation of intermediate features using previous frame information. This is a novel technique not explored before for video translation model compression.

- Experiments demonstrate superior performance over prior image-based compression methods like CAT and OMGD in terms of computational efficiency and maintaining output quality. 

- The proposed approach also outperforms Fast-Vid2Vid, a video-specific method, while being more generally applicable across models.

- Shortcut-V2V achieves 3.2-5.7x speedup and 7.8-44x memory savings with comparable performance to original models. This is a significant efficiency gain compared to prior arts.

- The qualitative and quantitative experiments on diverse datasets and models like Unsup and vid2vid showcase the generalizability of the framework.

In summary, this paper pushes state-of-the-art in video translation model compression by introducing a novel general framework and outperforming prior model-specific and image-based compression techniques significantly. The core ideas like AdaBD and exploiting temporal redundancy seem promising for future research.
