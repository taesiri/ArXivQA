# [High-Fidelity Audio Compression with Improved RVQGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06546)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we develop a high-fidelity universal neural audio compression algorithm that achieves high compression rates while maintaining high audio quality across diverse audio types?The key points are:- The paper introduces an improved neural audio compression model called Improved RVQGAN that can compress high-resolution audio signals into discrete tokens while preserving high audio fidelity. - The goal is to develop a universal audio compression model that works well across diverse domains like speech, music, environment sounds, and different sampling rates.- The model aims to achieve high compression rates (upto 90x) while minimizing loss in audio quality and artifacts compared to original signals.- The authors make improvements over prior work in neural audio codecs like SoundStream and EnCodec by using better vector quantization techniques, adding periodic inductive biases, improved adversarial and reconstruction losses etc.- The proposed model is evaluated against competing methods and shown to outperform them significantly on both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed Improved RVQGAN model can push the state-of-the-art in high-fidelity neural audio compression across diverse domains while achieving high compression rates. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is an improved neural audio compression algorithm called Improved RVQGAN. The key aspects are:- It achieves high compression ratios (~90x) of 44.1 kHz audio into discrete codes at just 8 kbps bandwidth with minimal loss of audio quality.- It combines recent advances in high-fidelity audio generation, improved vector quantization techniques from image modeling, and better adversarial and reconstruction losses. - It is a universal model that can compress all types of audio signals like speech, music, environment sounds into a single model.- It significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art audio compression algorithms like Lyra, EnCodec, and Opus in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.- Thorough ablation studies are provided to justify each design decision of the model architecture, losses, and training process.- The code, model weights, and audio samples are open-sourced to facilitate future research.In summary, the main contribution is a new state-of-the-art neural audio codec that achieves much higher compression ratios with better audio quality across diverse audio domains, through several impactful modeling improvements over prior arts. The thorough analysis and open-source release aim to advance audio modeling research.
