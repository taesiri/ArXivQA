# [High-Fidelity Audio Compression with Improved RVQGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06546)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we develop a high-fidelity universal neural audio compression algorithm that achieves high compression rates while maintaining high audio quality across diverse audio types?The key points are:- The paper introduces an improved neural audio compression model called Improved RVQGAN that can compress high-resolution audio signals into discrete tokens while preserving high audio fidelity. - The goal is to develop a universal audio compression model that works well across diverse domains like speech, music, environment sounds, and different sampling rates.- The model aims to achieve high compression rates (upto 90x) while minimizing loss in audio quality and artifacts compared to original signals.- The authors make improvements over prior work in neural audio codecs like SoundStream and EnCodec by using better vector quantization techniques, adding periodic inductive biases, improved adversarial and reconstruction losses etc.- The proposed model is evaluated against competing methods and shown to outperform them significantly on both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed Improved RVQGAN model can push the state-of-the-art in high-fidelity neural audio compression across diverse domains while achieving high compression rates. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.
