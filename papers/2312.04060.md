# [Differentiable Registration of Images and LiDAR Point Clouds with   VoxelPoint-to-Pixel Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04060)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for image-to-point cloud registration by learning a structured cross-modality latent space and employing end-to-end training with a differentiable PnP solver. The method represents 3D elements as a combination of voxels and points in order to bridge the domain gap between points and pixels. Specifically, a triplet network is designed consisting of voxel, point, and pixel branches to extract features, where the voxel and pixel branches leverage CNNs for spatial convolutions. An adaptive-weighted loss is proposed to optimize positive and negative feature matches in a robust manner. Further, a differentiable probabilistic PnP solver provides end-to-end supervision on the predicted pose distribution using KL divergence. Experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of registration accuracy and efficiency. The structured cross-modality latent space, adaptive weighting scheme, and end-to-end training are key factors enabling robust 2D-3D feature matching and accurate pose prediction.
