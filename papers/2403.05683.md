# [Efficient Public Health Intervention Planning Using Decomposition-Based   Decision-Focused Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Public health programs often suffer from declining participation of beneficiaries over time. A common strategy is to have health workers intervene (e.g. personalized calls) with beneficiaries at risk of dropping out to improve retention. However, health worker time is a limited resource.
- Past work has modeled this as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problem, where each beneficiary is an "arm". The goal is to select which subset of beneficiaries to intervene with to maximize overall engagement, subject to a budget constraint on health worker capacity.  
- The key challenge is estimating the transition matrices of each beneficiary's engagement from historical data, which is required to determine the optimal intervention policy. Recent work shows Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) outperforms traditional supervised learning here. 
- However, DFL has high computational cost because it requires solving and evaluating the RMAB in each training step. Past approximate DFL methods still require expensive simulations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a principled way to exploit structure of RMABs to enable fast intervention planning by decomposing the problem across beneficiaries. 
- It starts by showing why prior decomposition approaches violate budget constraints. Then it proposes an alternate problem formulation and approximations that provably enable good parameter estimation.
- The key ideas are: (1) Optimizing over a richer policy class while enforcing budget constraints to get provable guarantees; (2) Decomposing this problem by assuming beneficiaries have small MDPs; (3) Efficiently incorporating this decomposition into the DFL pipeline using ideas from optimization literature.

Main Contributions:
- A novel "Fast DEC-DFL" method that is up to 500x faster than current DFL approaches for RMABs, while also improving model performance.
- Principled integration of ideas from planning and DFL literature to enable decomposed policy creation and evaluation for RMABs. 
- Evaluation on real-world data from ARMMAN, an Indian NGO, showing improved computational scalability. This allows the NGO to potentially reach millions more beneficiaries.
- Moves us one step closer to achieving UN SDG 3.1 of reducing maternal mortality through data-driven public health planning.
