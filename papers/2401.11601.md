# [Robust Evaluation Measures for Evaluating Social Biases in Masked   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11601)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing measures for evaluating social biases in masked language models (MLMs) lack robustness when using limited datasets. 
- They simply compare pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences using an indicator function. This doesn't capture distributional information of the PLL scores.
- They are sensitive to differences in PLL scores, quality/pitfalls of individual samples, and size of the dataset.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent the set of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical PLL scores as Gaussian distributions. 
- Use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between these distributions to construct robust evaluation measures - KLS and JSS.
- KLS measures the asymmetric distance between distributions. Closer KLS to 50 indicates less bias.
- JSS combines JS divergence and standard deviation of PLL scores. Penalizes models if variance between distributions is high.

Main Contributions:
- Designed robust and interpretable measures KLS and JSS for evaluating social biases in MLMs by modeling PLL scores as distributions.
- Captures distributional information about the PLL scores instead of just comparing scores.
- Evaluated on StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs datasets. Proposed measures are more robust to limited datasets.
- Analysis shows measures correlate well with prior indicator function-based measures but do not suffer from their limitations.
- Representing PLL scores as distributions provides insight into differences between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical preferences.

In summary, the key innovation is modeling PLL scores with Gaussian distributions and using information theoretic divergences to design robust social bias evaluation measures for MLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes robust evaluation measures KLS and JSS for assessing social biases in masked language models by modeling stereotypical and anti-stereotypical pseudo-log-likelihood scores as Gaussian distributions and using KL and JS divergence to quantify the difference between distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing new evaluation measures called KLS and JSS for evaluating social biases in masked language models. Specifically:

- KLS and JSS represent the pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences as Gaussian distributions in order to capture distributional information about the PLL scores. 

- KLS uses Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the difference between the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical PLL score distributions. JSS uses Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence.

- Experiments show that KLS and JSS are more robust than previous evaluation measures like StereoSet Score and CrowS-Pairs Score in scenarios with limited datasets. 

- Modeling the PLL scores as distributions and using divergences makes the new evaluation measures more interpretable in terms of capturing the difference between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical preferences.

In summary, the main contribution is designing more robust and interpretable evaluation measures for social bias in language models by representing PLL scores as distributions and using information-theoretic divergences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper models the distributions of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores as Gaussian distributions. What is the motivation behind using a Gaussian distribution specifically to model these score distributions? What are the advantages of using a Gaussian distribution over other types of distributions in this context?

2) The Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) is used to construct one of the proposed evaluation measures, KLS. Explain the intuition behind using KLD to quantify the difference between the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical PLL score distributions. Why is KLD an appropriate divergence measure in this context? 

3) Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) is used in the construction of the other proposed evaluation measure, JSS. What are some of the main advantages of using JSD over using KLD for comparing the PLL score distributions? Why does JSD complement KLD as an evaluation measure?

4) The standard deviation term is incorporated into the formulation of JSS. What is the motivation behind penalizing JSS based on the standard deviations of the PLL score distributions? Why should a higher standard deviation be indicative of poorer stability?

5) The formulation of KLS uses a normalization factor in the denominator. Explain the purpose of this normalization factor and why it is important for interpretability of the KLS measure. 

6) Compare and contrast the indicator function based approaches used in prior work versus the distribution divergence based approaches proposed in this paper. What are some weaknesses of indicator function based approaches that are addressed by modeling score distributions?

7) The paper demonstrates higher robustness of KLS and JSS compared to prior measures using sampling experiments. Explain why distribution-based measures can be more robust with limited sized datasets compared to indicator function based measures.

8) Discuss the differences in information captured by KLS versus JSS. What complementary insights do they provide about biases in language models? When would one be preferred over the other?

9) The formulation of the measures combines contributions across different bias types using a weighting scheme. Explain the rationale behind this weighted combination and why it is useful for evaluating models on datasets with multiple bias types.

10) The paper models uni-modal Gaussian distributions for the PLL scores, but are there situations where multi-modal or non-Gaussian distributions could provide better fits? How would the proposed approaches need to be adapted to handle such cases?
