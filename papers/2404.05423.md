# [Residual Chain Prediction for Autonomous Driving Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional path planning methods for autonomous vehicles, relying on manually defined rules/costs, fail in complex dynamic environments. 
- End-to-end learning-based approaches are emerging to improve adaptability but imitation learning methods like behavior cloning (BC) face challenges like covariate shift.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new loss function called Residual Chain Loss that dynamically adjusts the loss calculation to enhance temporal dependency and accuracy of predicted path points.

- Instead of predicting future point coordinates directly, output relative coordinates between adjacent points. Modify ground truth to represent distance between expert coordinates and cumulative predicted relative coordinates.

- This accounts for dynamic adjustments based on previous predictions while assessing displacement between predicted and expert points.

Key Contributions:

- Handles covariate shift better by using relative coordinate outputs, aligning predicted and expert points.

- Allows dynamic loss adjustment based on sequence of previously predicted points, improving accuracy over time without increasing computation.

- Designed to be compatible with various end-to-end path planning models for easy adoption.

- Testing on nuScenes dataset shows substantial improvements in addressing covariate shift, enabling better sequential predictions, and integrating smoothly into end-to-end frameworks.

- Has strong potential to enhance path planning in autonomous driving, moving towards higher levels of driving automation.

In summary, the Residual Chain Loss method introduces an innovative dynamically adjusting loss function that leverages relative coordinates and previously predicted points to boost path prediction accuracy for end-to-end autonomous driving systems.
