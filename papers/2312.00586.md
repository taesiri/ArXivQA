# [Explainable Fraud Detection with Deep Symbolic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00586)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Deep Symbolic Classification (DSC), a novel framework for explainable fraud detection in financial transactions. DSC extends Deep Symbolic Regression to handle classification tasks by incorporating a sigmoid output layer and optimizing a classification metric like F1 score, making it robust to class imbalance. DSC uses a recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement learning to search the space of mathematical expressions to find concise symbolic expressions that model the classification boundary. When applied to the PaySim credit card transaction dataset, DSC achieves predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art black box methods like XGBoost, while producing transparent mathematical decision rules involving just a few key features like transaction type, external account flags, and transaction amount statistics. An analysis with a domain expert confirms the decision rules match real world fraud patterns. DSC balances performance and explainability, eliminating problematic undersampling, and provides inherent interpretability at both the individual decision and global model behavior levels. The concise symbolic expressions facilitate understanding of the driving factors behind fraudulent transactions. This establishes DSC as a promising intrinsically explainable model for financial fraud detection systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep symbolic classification framework for explainable fraud detection that generates analytical decision rules robust to class imbalance and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art blackbox models on the PaySim dataset while providing inherent explainability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Deep Symbolic Classification (DSC) for explainable fraud detection in financial transactions. Key aspects of DSC include:

- It extends the Deep Symbolic Regression framework to classification by adding a sigmoid layer and threshold-based decision mechanism. This allows generating analytical expressions suitable for fraud detection.

- It uses the F1 score as the reward function during training to directly optimize performance on imbalanced data, eliminating the need for problematic techniques like over/undersampling. 

- The generated expressions are transparent, allowing for explanation of both individual decisions and the overall decision process. This explainability is useful for fraud detection systems where transparency is often legally required.

- It allows explicitly trading off between predictive performance and explainability, enabling selection of a Pareto optimal solution aligning with desired requirements.

- Evaluation shows competitive predictive performance to state-of-the-art blackbox models on a fraud detection dataset, while providing superior explainability.

In summary, DSC contributes a novel, explainable and high-performing solution tailored to the requirements of fraud detection systems. The explainability in particular addresses an important gap compared to existing methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes Deep Symbolic Classification (DSC) as an extension of Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR). How does DSC differ from DSR and what modifications were made to adapt DSR for classification tasks like fraud detection?

2. One key contribution of DSC is handling class imbalance without problematic techniques like over/undersampling. How does the use of the F1 score as a reward function help mitigate class imbalance issues during model training?

3. What is the motivation behind using a risk-seeking policy gradient objective to train the RNN instead of a standard policy gradient method? How does this impact the search for optimal expressions during training?

4. The Pareto front analysis reveals a trade-off between expression complexity and predictive performance. What does this imply about the relationship between model explainability and accuracy? How can stakeholders use the Pareto front to select an optimal solution?

5. The decision threshold t is an important hyperparameter in DSC. How does varying this threshold impact metrics like precision and recall? What is the reason behind choosing a high threshold value of 0.8 based on the results?

6. What preprocessing steps were taken to handle issues like data leakage and inadequate customer behavior profiling in the PaySim dataset? How do features like externalOrig and externalDest help mitigate these?

7. The paper mentions limitations of DSC like longer training times compared to RF and XGBoost. What architectural improvements could help reduce training time and improve computational efficiency of DSC?  

8. How useful did the domain expert find the extracted decision rule? What key relationships did it capture according to them and how does it align with known fraudulent behavior?

9. One finding states that increased expression complexity does not necessarily yield better predictive performance. Why might this be the case? Does DSC exhibit signs of overfitting with more complex expressions?

10. The paper focuses on binary classification of fraudulent transactions. How can the DSC framework be extended to support multi-class classification among different fraud types?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Fraud detection systems (FDS) used by banks need to be explainable to justify decisions to customers and authorities. However, state-of-the-art deep learning models for fraud detection lack transparency into their decision making processes. Additionally, fraud detection suffers from highly imbalanced data (far more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones), which can degrade performance. The paper argues that inherently explainable models are needed that have competitive predictive performance and can handle imbalance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Deep Symbolic Classification (DSC), which casts fraud detection as a search problem for analytical classification functions that optimize a performance metric. DSC uses a recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement learning to search the space of mathematical expressions. The expressions map transaction features to probabilities through a sigmoid function. A genetic programming algorithm provides an inner optimization loop.

Key Contributions:

- DSC generates transparent fraud detection models in the form of concise mathematical expressions, enabling model-level and decision-level explanations.

- By directly optimizing the F1 score, DSC handles the class imbalance problem without problematic undersampling/oversampling. 

- DSC allows navigating the tradeoff between predictive performance and explainability. A Pareto front shows performance versus complexity.

- Experiment on the PaySim dataset shows DSC achieves competitive predictive performance to XGBoost, while surpassing it in explainability. The obtained expression aligns with domain knowledge.

- DSC eliminates the need for manual feature engineering through its search over mathematical expressions. The framework is intrinsically suited for evolving fraud tactics.

In summary, DSC presents a promising, transparent and inherently explainable solution for fraud detection that rivals state-of-the-art approaches. The concise analytical models offer decision-level and model-level explanations desired by authorities and businesses.
