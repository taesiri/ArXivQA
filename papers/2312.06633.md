# [Examining the Effect of Implementation Factors on Deep Learning   Reproducibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06633)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates how implementation factors like hardware and software environments affect the reproducibility of deep learning experiment results. The authors ran three common deep learning experiments - image classification, sentiment analysis, and fraud detection - multiple times across different hardware setups and Docker containers. They found over a 6% variance in accuracy across runs of the same deterministic examples based on the environment used. This shows that researchers cannot fully trust claims about relative algorithm performance unless experiments are repeated across diverse environments. A key incidental finding was a software bug causing nondeterminism in some runs, further illustrating the value of multi-environment experiments. The authors conclude that to make sound analysis and interpretations, deep learning practitioners should verify their hypotheses and results over multiple hardwares and softwares. They suggest the community establish standard procedures, akin to other fields like analytical chemistry. Overall, this paper clearly highlights how sensible-seeming deep learning results can secretly depend on implementation factors, threatening reproducibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the impact of hardware and software implementation factors on deep learning experiment reproducibility by running three deep learning experiments multiple times across different hardware and software environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates the impact of implementation factors (hardware and software environments) on the reproducibility of deep learning experiment results. Specifically, it runs three different deep learning experiments multiple times across 13 different hardware environments and 4 different software environments. The key finding is that variations in hardware and software alone can introduce over a 6% variance in accuracy on the same deterministic examples. This indicates that researchers should run deep learning experiments multiple times on different hardware/software to verify their conclusions are robust. Overall, the paper provides evidence that implementation factors can significantly affect deep learning outcomes and that controlling for these factors is important for achieving reproducible research.

In summary, the main contribution is quantitatively demonstrating the effect implementation factors can have on deep learning reproducibility, and providing the recommendation that researchers should test conclusions across multiple hardare/software environments.

- Interpretation reproducibility

The paper examines how implementation factors like hardware and software environments affect the reproducibility of deep learning experiments. It runs deep learning experiments multiple times across different hardware and software setups to see the variation in outcomes. The key goal is to understand if changes in outcomes due to implementation factors alter the analysis and interpretation or not. So the core focus is on deep learning reproducibility in the context of hardware, software, outcomes, analysis, and interpretation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes running experiments multiple times across different hardware and software environments. How many times exactly should experiments be repeated before researchers can trust the results are not affected by implementation factors? What is the rationale behind this number?

2. The paper examines implementation factors using Docker containers to control the software environment. What are the limitations of using containers? Could other software environment control methods like virtual machines give different results? 

3. The paper uses resources from the Open Science Grid (OSG) to access the heterogeneous hardware environments. What characteristics of the OSG hardware could have impacted the results? How might results differ on commercial cloud platforms?

4. The paper finds over an 8% accuracy range for the bidirectional LSTM example. Can you explain the software bug causing this and why it only affected GPU environments? How might this impact adoption of GPUs for research?

5. The paper rebuilds one container to fix the software bug. Why not rebuild all containers? What are the tradeoffs in rebuilding versus using containers as provided?

6. The paper examines three ML disciplines: computer vision, NLP, and structured data. Do you think implementation factors affect some areas of ML more than others? Why?

7. The paper uses deterministic versions of published Keras examples. How difficult was modifying the examples to be deterministic? What are other ways researchers could control experiments?  

8. The paper suggests borrowing guidelines from analytical chemistry to reproduce ML experiments in 8+ environments. Is this realistic and worthwhile for ML researchers? How could it be encouraged?

9. The paper focuses on accuracy metric differences. How might implementation factors impact other metrics like inference time, memory usage etc? Should these also be examined?

10. The paper concludes claims about ML algorithm performance cannot be trusted without multi-environment testing. Do you agree this should be a requirement before publishing results? What barriers exist to adopting such testing?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reproducing published deep learning papers is difficult due to various sources of irreproducibility. One key source is implementation factors such as hardware and software environments.  
- The impact of these implementation factors on reproducibility of deep learning studies needs to be investigated.

Methods:
- 3 deep learning experiments (computer vision, NLP, structured data tasks) were run 5 times each on 13 different hardware setups and 4 software environments (Docker containers with diff TensorFlow/CUDA versions).
- 780 experiment runs in total. Hardware environments were heterogeneous resources from Open Science Grid.

Results: 
- There was a >6% accuracy range in the results caused solely by hardware/software variations. 
- One software environment had a cuDNN bug causing >8% accuracy range for bidirectional LSTM model. Fixing it removed this non-determinism.

Conclusions:
- Researchers cannot fully trust claims like "Model A better than B on Task X" if experiments only run in 1 environment. 
- Variations from implementation factors can lead to different conclusions than if ran on just 1 setup.
- Suggest running deep learning experiments on multiple software/hardware environments to ensure analysis/interpretation reproducibility.

Main Contributions:
- Quantitatively examined impact of hardware and software environments on reproducibility of 3 deep learning experiments
- Showed accuracy can vary by >6% just from these factors, enough to affect conclusions
- Proposed running experiments on multiple environments to verify conclusions unaffected
