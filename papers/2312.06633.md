# [Examining the Effect of Implementation Factors on Deep Learning   Reproducibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06633)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates how implementation factors like hardware and software environments affect the reproducibility of deep learning experiment results. The authors ran three common deep learning experiments - image classification, sentiment analysis, and fraud detection - multiple times across different hardware setups and Docker containers. They found over a 6% variance in accuracy across runs of the same deterministic examples based on the environment used. This shows that researchers cannot fully trust claims about relative algorithm performance unless experiments are repeated across diverse environments. A key incidental finding was a software bug causing nondeterminism in some runs, further illustrating the value of multi-environment experiments. The authors conclude that to make sound analysis and interpretations, deep learning practitioners should verify their hypotheses and results over multiple hardwares and softwares. They suggest the community establish standard procedures, akin to other fields like analytical chemistry. Overall, this paper clearly highlights how sensible-seeming deep learning results can secretly depend on implementation factors, threatening reproducibility.
