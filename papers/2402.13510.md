# [SealD-NeRF: Interactive Pixel-Level Editing for Dynamic Scenes by Neural   Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13510)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent work has extended neural radiance fields (NeRF) to handle dynamic scenes using networks like D-NeRF. However, there is a lack of interactive editing capabilities for such dynamic scene representations. Existing NeRF editing methods focus on static scenes and cannot achieve pixel-level editing consistency across time in dynamic scenes. Manually propagating edits across frames is impractical.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper introduces SealD-NeRF, an interactive framework for pixel-level editing of dynamic scenes represented by D-NeRF. It allows users to edit an arbitrary frame, with changes automatically applied to all other frames in a consistent manner. 

The key idea is to generate an editing guidance "teacher" model for one frame via user input. This frame's edits are then propagated to all times by freezing the deformation network (which handles inter-frame motion) and training the canonical network to match the teacher.

The editing tools allow brush-based geometry edits and sealing images onto surfaces. Consistency over time is achieved by transforming edits into the canonical space that interlinks all frames' neural representations.

Main Contributions:
- Implementation of D-NeRF using the Torch-NGP framework
- Interactive brush and sealing tools for editing a single frame of a D-NeRF model
- Technique to propagate pixel-level edits from one frame consistently across the entire timeline by freezing deformations and retraining the canonical network

The method is limited by potential error propagation and difficulty introducing entirely new elements. But overall it enables precise interactive editing of dynamic neural radiance fields.
