# [GUMsley: Evaluating Entity Salience in Summarization for 12 English   Genres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Salient entity extraction (SEE) is important for downstream NLP tasks like summarization and information retrieval. 
- Most prior SEE datasets are focused on news articles and use inconsistent crowdsourcing or proxy signals like hyperlinks to derive salience labels. 
- This limits performance on more diverse data and introduces subjective biases.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present GUMsley, an SEE dataset covering 12 genres of English text. 
- Salience is defined strictly based on whether an entity appears in high quality human reference summaries, ensuring consistency.
- The data contains Wikification IDs and coreference chains enabling advanced evaluation.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces the first manually annotated SEE dataset across 12 diverse English genres with 213 documents.
- Achieves high inter-annotator agreement demonstrating consistent salience annotations.  
- Evaluation shows major summarization models and LLMs perform poorly on capturing salient entities.
- Providing gold or predicted salient entities significantly boosts summarization performance and reduces hallucination.
- The data and benchmark provides a challenging testbed to advance entity-based summarization and related areas.

In summary, this paper makes available an expert-annotated, multi-genre dataset for salient entity extraction to promote research on entity-centric summarization and related tasks. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate the difficulty existing systems have in capturing salient information as well as the benefits of providing salient entities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents and evaluates GUMsley, a new manually annotated dataset for salient entity extraction across 12 genres of English text, and shows that providing gold or predicted salient entities to summarization models enhances performance and helps alleviate entity hallucination issues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of \corpname{}, the first manually annotated entity salience dataset covering all named and non-named salient entities for 12 genres of English text. The key aspects of \corpname{} and its contribution include:

- It provides gold standard entity salience annotations aligned with entity types, Wikification links and coreference information across 12 diverse text genres.

- It uses a strict definition of salience based on whether an entity is mentioned in human-written summaries, ensuring high inter-annotator agreement. 

- Evaluation shows poor performance of state-of-the-art summarization models and LLMs in capturing salient entities, demonstrating the challenge presented by the dataset.

- Experiments also show that providing gold or predicted salient entities significantly improves summarization performance and reduces hallucination issues, highlighting the usefulness of the annotations.

In summary, \corpname{} contributes a new high-quality entity salience benchmark enabling further research on this task across a broad range of text genres, while also showing the utility of salient entity information for improving summarization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Salient entity extraction (SEE)
- Entity salience dataset
- GUMsalient linked entity corpus (\corpname) 
- 12 genres of English text
- Human summaries
- Inter-annotator agreement
- Entity hallucination
- Controllable summarization
- Zero-shot language models
- Prompt-based models
- Abstractive summarization models

The paper introduces a new manually annotated dataset called \corpname{} for evaluating entity salience across 12 diverse genres of text. It uses human summaries to define salient entities and achieves high inter-annotator agreement. The paper then evaluates state-of-the-art summarization models and prompt-based LLMs on their ability to capture salient entities and shows improvements by providing gold entity information. Key concepts covered include entity salience, genre diversity, faithfulness of summaries, and the utility of providing salient entities to models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset called GUMsley for evaluating entity salience extraction. What are some key differences between GUMsley and existing entity salience datasets like the NYT corpus? How does the coverage of multiple genres and inclusion of spoken data genres help advance research?

2. The paper defines entity salience strictly based on whether an entity is mentioned in the human reference summary. What are some potential limitations of this definition? Could an alternative definition considering things like an entity's prominence, centrality, or frequency also be reasonable?

3. The inter-annotator agreement scores are very high in GUMsley. What annotation guidelines and procedures contribute to this level of consistency? How might the agreement differ if annotators had more freedom or the task was more subjective?  

4. When evaluating the models, what trends do you notice in terms of better performance on spoken vs. written genres? Why might certain models struggle more on conversational data? What adaptations could help?

5. The paper shows that providing gold or predicted salient entities to models like CTRLSum and GPT-4 improves performance. What mechanisms allow these models to make better use of entity information compared to models like BRIO?

6. Qualitative analysis reveals GPT-4 can sometimes select inaccurate "salient" entities just based on an entity's position in the document. What could explain this behavior and how might the model's training be improved to avoid it?

7. Between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations, which type seems more prevalent in the GPT-4 summaries? What techniques could help minimize extrinsic hallucinations specifically?

8. How rigorous and reliable is the reference-based evaluation paradigm used in this paper? What are some ways to complement it with human evaluation to confirm summary quality? 

9. Could the GUMsley dataset be improved by including multiple reference summaries? What challenges would that introduce for annotation and evaluation?

10. The paper focuses on English text. How difficult would it be to construct comparable entity salience datasets for lower-resource languages? What linguistic factors might make this more challenging?
