# [Quality Diversity in the Amorphous Fortress (QD-AF): Evolving for   Complexity in 0-Player Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open-ended environments like games allow for emergent and complex interactions between systems and agents. However, developing such environments is challenging. 

- The Amorphous Fortress (AF) framework uses finite state machines (FSMs) to produce emergent AI behaviors in a grid-world environment. But the complexity and diversity of AF environments generated so far has been limited. 

Solution:
- The paper proposes Quality Diversity in Amorphous Fortress (QD-AF) which uses the MAP-Elites quality diversity algorithm to evolve AF environments that exhibit diverse agent behaviors and complexity.

- QD-AF optimizes two main behavior characteristics (BCs) - the number of agent instances at the end of simulation, and the total number of FSM nodes across all agents. This explores population dynamics and FSM complexity.

- The fitness function rewards environments where agents explore more FSM states during simulation. This encourages complex agent behaviors to emerge.

- QD-AF generates a wide diversity of AF environments forming an "archive" which shows different agent population equilibriums and FSM exploration levels.

Key Contributions:  
- Demonstrates QD can be used to create diverse open-ended multi-agent environments with emergent complexity in AF.

- Environments exhibit competitive/cooperative survival dynamics between agent species.

- Metrics based on FSM architecture and agent populations can capture environment complexity.

- Archive of environments can serve as testbed for evaluating learning algorithms by providing curriculum of increasing complexity.

In summary, the key innovation is using QD to generate a wide diversity of grid-world simulation environments exhibiting non-trivial agent behaviors and interactions, which can accelerate research in open-ended learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper uses quality diversity search to evolve sets of interacting finite state machine agents within gridworld environments, aiming to uncover environments exhibiting complex population dynamics that could serve as challenging domains for multi-agent reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is using quality diversity evolutionary search to generate a diverse archive of grid-world environments in the Amorphous Fortress framework. Specifically:

- They implement the MAP-Elites quality diversity algorithm to illuminate an archive of Amorphous Fortress environments that exhibit diversity along axes measuring agent finite state machine complexity and population dynamics.

- They generate families of 0-player games with competitive and cooperative multi-agent survival dynamics by optimizing for metrics related to the proportion of agent finite state machines that are explored during simulation rollouts.

- They argue these generated fortress environments collectively serve as training and testing grounds for learning algorithms by exposing agents to environments that require adapting to varying levels of complexity in terms of agent policies and interactions.

In summary, the key contribution is using quality diversity search to generate a diverse set of grid-world environments exhibiting non-trivial agent dynamics that could facilitate training more robust learning agents.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using MAP-Elites to evolve populations of entity class FSMs along with fortress layouts. What are some of the benefits of using a quality diversity algorithm like MAP-Elites rather than a simple evolutionary algorithm or hill climber? How does maintaining a grid of elites with different behavior characteristics encourage the emergence of complex collective dynamics?

2. The behavior characteristics used to bin MAP-Elites individuals include the number of surviving entities and the total number of FSM nodes. Can you think of any other potential behavior characteristics that could lead to interesting results? For example, what if you used metrics related to the types of nodes activated over a simulation? 

3. The paper mentions using predictive models to estimate the complexity of a fortress for a hypothetical learning agent. What types of neural network architectures do you think would be well-suited to predicting simulation rollouts? How might you modify or augment such a model to get complexity estimates specifically tailored to evaluating potential learning environments?

4. The fitness function used focuses on ensuring entity FSMs are fully explored over the course of a simulation. Can you think of any weaknesses or potential issues that might result from optimizing too heavily for this metric? When might a fortress with lower FSM exploration still make for an interesting learning environment?

5. The discussion section mentions mixing human and automated design through an online fortress editor. What are some ways a human could provide useful signals to further enhance the quality and diversity of fortresses generated? How might human narrativizations of simulation dynamics be incorporated in future work? 

6. Can you think of any ways the basic framework of Amorphous Fortress could be extended? What other types of atomic mechanics or terrain features would lend themselves to the recombination-based approach explored here?

7. The paper envisions injecting an RL agent to control a single entity type within a fortress. What are some considerations in formulating a reward function for such an agent? Should it be modeled more as a single-agent or multi-agent RL problem?

8. What types of analysis on the entity class FSMs and simulation rollouts could you perform to automatically generate goals for an RL agent controlling part of a fortress? How might you determine goals of varying difficulty?

9. One weakness noted is that larger FSMs are generally less thoroughly explored over short simulation lengths. Other than simply increasing episode length, can you think of modifications to the evolution itself that might lead to better optimization of larger FSMs?

10. The method searches over a combinatorial space of possible fortress configurations. Do you think this type of search could be accelerated by incorporating more structured priors over the space of possible fortresses? How might you design an informative model of "interestingness" for this domain?
