# [Efficient Global Navigational Planning in 3D Structures based on Point   Cloud Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07631)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Navigating ground robots in complex 3D environments with multi-layer structures is challenging. Existing methods using point clouds, meshes or grid maps have limitations in efficiently representing the environment geometry and semantics for rapid scene understanding and smooth trajectory generation. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a highly efficient global navigation framework for ground robots based on point cloud tomography. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the environment as tomogram slices which are multi-channel grid maps containing ground and ceiling elevation layers. This encodes 3D structures while maintaining simplicity and efficiency of 2D elevation maps.

2) Rapidly evaluate scene traversability by analyzing terrain conditions and spatial structures, considering robot's motion and height adjustment capabilities. This is accelerated via parallel computation.

3) Alleviate trajectory generation complexity by searching through multiple 2D slices instead of direct 3D planning. Adjust robot height separately to avoid overhangs.

Main Contributions:

- Novel tomographic scene representation that extends elevation maps to multi-layer 3D spaces with simplicity and efficiency

- GPU-based mapping and evaluation that reduces computation time by 3 orders of magnitude while incorporating robot capabilities

- Path planning through slices that improves speed by 3 times over 3D planning 

- An integrated framework that achieves over 100x faster navigation than prior arts, with feasibility demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot in real-world experiments

The framework is extensible to incorporate advanced mapping, evaluation and planning methods. It shows strong potential for efficient global navigation and exploration in complex environments by ground robots.
