# [SaGE: Evaluating Moral Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly developed and deployed, but there are concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness when making moral judgments. Specifically, LLMs often give inconsistent responses to semantically equivalent moral scenarios.
- Moral consistency is important as inconsistent moral judgments can negatively impact users' trust in LLMs, corrupt moral beliefs, and lead to unpredictable or unethical behavior when deployed. 
- However, there is a lack of standardized methodologies and metrics to effectively evaluate the moral consistency of LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel metric called Semantic Graph Entropy (SaGE) to measure moral consistency of LLMs without need for human evaluation. 
- SaGE is grounded in the concept of "Rules of Thumb" (RoTs), which are abstract principles learned by LLMs that guide their moral judgments. 
- The approach checks if an LLM consistently follows the same RoTs when answering semantically equivalent paraphrased questions on moral scenarios.
- The paper constructs a Moral Consistency Corpus (MCC) containing moral questions, LLM responses and extracted RoTs to evaluate consistency.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs have very low moral consistency based on evaluations using the proposed SaGE metric and MCC benchmark.
- Shows that SaGE reliably correlates with human judgments of consistency compared to previous metrics.
- Reveals that accuracy and consistency are independent problems, as high performing LLMs on standard benchmarks still show very low consistency.
- Discusses a potential method to improve moral consistency of LLMs by prompting them to follow specific RoTs.
- Overall, establishes moral inconsistency as an important problem in LLMs and provides a standardized way to evaluate it without human involvement.

The summary covers the key points about the problem being addressed, the proposed semantic graph entropy metric and dataset to evaluate moral consistency, the experiments revealing current LLM inconsistencies, and insights into improving consistency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel metric called Semantic Graph Entropy (SaGE) to measure the moral consistency of large language models, reveals that even state-of-the-art models are inconsistent, and emphasizes the need for developing more reliable AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework to measure the moral consistency of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a new metric called Semantic Graph Entropy (SaGE) to quantify the moral consistency of LLMs by analyzing the semantic graph created from rules of thumb (RoTs) followed by the model. 

2) The paper constructs the Moral Consistency Corpus (MCC), containing moral questions, LLM responses, and corresponding RoTs. This serves as a benchmark to evaluate moral consistency.

3) Experiments using SaGE reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs are morally inconsistent, highlighting this as an important issue needing further investigation. 

4) The paper shows task accuracy and moral consistency are independent problems, emphasizing the need for proper evaluation strategies beyond just accuracy.

5) The generalizability of the metric is demonstrated by evaluating consistency on other datasets like TruthfulQA and HellaSwag.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a standardized methodology and metric to evaluate the moral consistency of LLMs to align them better with human values.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Evaluation 
- Trustworthiness
- Consistency
- Reliability 
- Morality
- Semantic graph entropy (SaGE)

- Moral consistency corpus (MCC)

The paper introduces a new methodology called "Semantic Graph Entropy" (SaGE) to evaluate the moral consistency of large language models. It is grounded in the concept of "rules of thumb" which are basic principles a model learns about morality. The authors construct a new dataset called the "Moral Consistency Corpus" (MCC) to test language models, and show that even state-of-the-art models are inconsistent in moral scenarios. The overall focus is on assessing trustworthiness, consistency and reliability of LLMs when dealing with subjective issues like morality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called Semantic Graph Entropy (SaGE). Can you explain in more detail how this metric is calculated and why it was chosen as an appropriate way to measure moral consistency? 

2. The paper constructs a Moral Consistency Corpus (MCC) to evaluate language models. What considerations went into developing this corpus and what steps were taken to ensure it has sufficient coverage of different moral scenarios?

3. Rules of Thumb (RoTs) are used as explanations for the language models' moral judgments. How exactly are these RoTs generated from the model's responses and what measures are in place to ensure consistent, high-quality RoT generation? 

4. How does the semantic graph construction process work? What sentence embeddings are used and why were they chosen over other embedding methods?

5. One experiment shows that moral consistency does not improve with temperature sampling. Can you explain the intuition behind why sampling methods do not help improve consistency in moral domains?  

6. What were some of the biggest challenges faced in developing an automated framework to evaluate moral consistency without human annotations? How does the framework account for subjectivity in moral scenarios?

7. The paper demonstrates generalizability of the method on TruthfulQA and HellaSwag. What modifications, if any, were required to adapt the pipeline for these datasets?

8. What ethical considerations went into the data collection, annotation, and release processes? How might the data be misused and what mitigations are in place?

9. The paper shows high correlation of SaGE with human judgments. What metrics was it compared against and why does it perform better? Could the human evaluation methodology be improved?

10. The paper concludes by showing RoT prompting improves consistency. How might this idea be expanded upon to build language models with greater moral alignment? What other methods seem promising for improving consistency?
