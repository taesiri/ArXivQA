# Knowledge-enhanced Mixed-initiative Dialogue System for Emotional   Support Conversations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to build an emotional support conversation system that can have mixed-initiative interactions?The key points are:- Emotional support conversation (ESC) systems need to not only show empathy but also proactively assist the user in exploring and addressing their problems. This requires mixed-initiative interactions where both the user and system can lead the conversation.- Existing empathetic dialogue systems mainly play a passive role in the conversation. The paper analyzes the necessity and challenges of incorporating mixed initiative into ESC systems. - The authors propose a novel framework (KEMI) with two main components: 1) Knowledge acquisition to retrieve relevant case knowledge from a mental health knowledge graph, 2) Mixed-initiative response generation with multi-task learning of strategy prediction and knowledge-grounded response generation.- Experiments show KEMI can produce better mixed-initiative responses and outperforms previous methods in both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating external knowledge and balancing mixed-initiative interactions.In summary, the central research question is how to enable mixed-initiative interactions in ESC systems, which is addressed by the proposed KEMI framework with knowledge acquisition and multi-task learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes an analysis framework and method for building mixed-initiative dialogue systems for emotional support conversations. The key contributions are:1. It conducts a novel analysis on mixed-initiative interactions in emotional support conversations (ESC), including proposing an EAFR annotation schema to label utterance roles and initiative types, and designing emotional support metrics to quantify characteristics of mixed initiative. The analysis reveals the necessity and challenges of building mixed-initiative ESC systems.2. It formally defines the problem of mixed-initiative ESC with three sub-tasks: strategy prediction, knowledge selection, and response generation. 3. It proposes a knowledge-enhanced mixed-initiative framework (KEMI) which retrieves domain-specific knowledge from a mental health knowledge graph using query expansion and subgraph retrieval, and generates mixed-initiative responses via multi-task learning.4. Experiments show KEMI achieves superior performance over strong baselines on content-preserving evaluation and analysis of mixed initiative. The analysis also demonstrates the importance of incorporating domain knowledge and taking proper initiatives in ESC.In summary, the key contribution is conducting an innovative analysis to reveal the importance of mixed initiative in ESC, based on which a knowledge-enhanced framework is proposed to generate mixed-initiative responses for better emotional support conversations.
