# [Taming Transformers for Realistic Lidar Point Cloud Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promising results for Lidar point cloud generation. However, they struggle to realistically model Lidar raydrop noise due to their inherent denoising process during sampling. This results in unrealistic range images lacking proper noise patterns.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose LidarGRIT, a novel two-stage generative model, to address this limitation. 
- In the first stage, an auto-regressive (AR) transformer is used to iteratively sample latent tokens that represent the range image. This allows progressive refinement.  
- In the second stage, a Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) decodes the tokens into a clean range image and separate raydrop mask. This disentangles raydrop noise generation.
- Two novel techniques are introduced: (1) A separate raydrop loss to explicitly model noise; (2) Geometric preservation to make the VQ-VAE capture geometry better and avoid overfitting.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of LidarGRIT - the first model to combine iterative sampling via transformers with explicit raydrop noise modeling using VQ-VAE.
- Proposal of raydrop loss and geometric preservation to enhance quality.
- Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments showing LidarGRIT outperforming state-of-the-art methods on KITTI-360 and KITTI Odometry datasets, especially in modeling noise patterns.

In summary, LidarGRIT pushes Lidar point cloud generation quality forward through a two-stage progressive sampling approach paired with explicit raydrop noise handling via two novel proposed techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods.
