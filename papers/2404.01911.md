# [VLRM: Vision-Language Models act as Reward Models for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01911)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image captioning models often lack fine-grained details in their captions, providing only high-level information. This is due to limitations in training data.
- Existing methods to enhance captions using large language models have high computational overhead during inference.

Proposed Solution: 
- Fine-tune an image captioning model (BLIP2) with reinforcement learning using a vision-language model (CLIP, BLIP2-ITM) as the reward model to guide caption generation.
- Reward model evaluates similarity between generated captions and images without needing human labeling.
- Enhances model's ability to describe more comprehensive details without added inference cost.

Key Contributions:
- Unsupervised fine-tuning method that improves caption quality without human-labeled data.
- No computational overhead at inference compared to applying large language models.  
- Reaches remarkable 0.90 CLIP Recall score on COCO, generating longer captions with more details.
- Important step towards building human-level multimodal AI that can perceive and describe visual scenes in detail.

In summary, the paper presents an unsupervised reinforcement learning-based method to significantly enhance the detail of image captions from models like BLIP2 by using vision-language models to automatically reward more comprehensive descriptions. This achieves state-of-the-art performance without added inference costs or human data requirements.
