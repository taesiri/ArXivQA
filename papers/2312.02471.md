# [Congestion-aware Distributed Task Offloading in Wireless Multi-hop   Networks Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02471)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel distributed task offloading framework for wireless multi-hop networks that integrates graph neural networks to enable congestion-aware offloading decisions. The key idea is to augment a distributed greedy offloading scheme, where each node selects the server with minimum round-trip delay based on probing, with a graph neural network that encodes the network topology and global task information into congestion-aware link weights. These link weights guide the distributed routing to mitigate congestion and bottlenecks while reducing task execution latency. Specifically, the graph neural network architecture leverages neighborhood message passing implemented through local communication rounds to learn accurate per-packet latency estimates. The end-to-end differentiable framework also enables optimization of the neural network parameters towards minimizing total execution latency through stochastic gradient descent. Evaluations on simulated wireless networks demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully avoids congestion and achieves lower task execution latency compared to both local computing and context-agnostic distributed offloading baselines, especially as network size increases. The scheme promises an efficient and scalable solution for distributed intelligence in wireless multi-hop networks.
