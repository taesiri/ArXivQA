# [PhyOT: Physics-informed object tracking in surveillance cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08650)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PhyOT, a hybrid deep learning and physics-based approach for object tracking in videos. The key idea is to leverage prior knowledge of physics, specifically laws of motion, to improve tracking accuracy. The authors formulate the tracking problem in a Kalman filtering framework, where deep neural networks act as "sensors" providing observations of object position and velocity. An optical flow module estimates velocity which allows modeling of nonlinear motion via estimated acceleration. The Kalman filter fuses these observations with physics priors to output improved state estimation. Experiments on warehouse and traffic camera datasets demonstrate that PhyOT outperforms state-of-the-art deep trackers like SiamFC, achieving over 10% higher AUC on success plots. The results validate the potential of hybrid approaches in computer vision, combining the representation power of deep learning with robustness from physics and algorithms. PhyOT thus demonstrates improved accuracy without loss of generalizability. The modular overall formulation also allows for transferability of components.
