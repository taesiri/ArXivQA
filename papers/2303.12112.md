# [Positive-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Image and Video Captioning   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12112)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop an improved automatic evaluation metric for image and video captioning. Specifically, the paper proposes a new metric called PAC-S (Positive-Augmented Contrastive learning Score) that aims to better correlate with human judgments compared to prior metrics. 

The key ideas behind PAC-S are:

- Leveraging a contrastive learning framework (based on CLIP) to learn multimodal embeddings that can match images and text.

- Finetuning the contrastive model on curated image-caption pairs from cleaned datasets like COCO rather than only using web-scale data. 

- Further regularizing the training by incorporating additional synthesized image and text pairs as extra positives.

- Evaluating similarity in the resulting embedding space to score caption quality.

The main hypothesis is that this combination of using curated data and extra synthetic positives to finetune a powerful contrastive model like CLIP will yield an embedding space better aligned with human judgments of caption quality. The experiments aim to validate whether PAC-S correlates better with human ratings than prior metrics like CIDEr, SPICE, BERT-Score, CLIP-Score etc on various caption evaluation datasets.

In summary, the key research question is whether the proposed positive-augmented contrastive learning approach can produce a superior automatic evaluation metric for image and video captioning. The paper hypothesizes this method will outperform existing metrics in human correlation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new metric called PAC-S (Positive-Augmented Contrastive learning Score) for evaluating image and video captions. The key ideas are:

- PAC-S is trained via a novel positive-augmented contrastive learning approach. In addition to real image-caption pairs from a cleaned dataset, it also utilizes generated images and captions as extra positive examples during training. 

- This allows PAC-S to leverage the benefits of pre-training on web data (via CLIP) as well as cleaned datasets. The generated data acts as additional supervision without the noise of web data.

- Experiments demonstrate PAC-S achieves higher correlation with human judgments compared to previous metrics like CIDEr, SPICE, CLIP-Score, etc on both images and videos.

- PAC-S shows improved sensitivity in detecting object hallucination compared to prior work.

- Analysis of different backbone choices like ViT and ResNet shows the metric is robust. The larger ViT-L/14 model gives the best results across datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is a new learnable evaluation metric PAC-S that outperforms existing reference-based and reference-free metrics through a novel positive-augmented contrastive learning approach. The improved correlation with humans and sensitivity to hallucination are demonstrated through extensive experiments.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new learnable metric called PAC-S for evaluating image and video captions. PAC-S is trained using a novel positive-augmented contrastive learning approach. It starts with a pre-trained CLIP model as a backbone and finetunes it on cleaned image-caption data pairs from COCO. To augment this data, it also leverages synthetically generated images from text and captions from images using modern generative models. The key idea is that pairing the real data with high-quality generated counterparts acts as additional supervisory signal without the noise of web-scale data. 

The metric is evaluated on various datasets like Flickr8k, Composite, Pascal-50S etc. and shows superior correlation with human judgments compared to prior metrics like CLIP-Score, CIDEr, SPICE etc. The benefits of positive-augmented training are clearly demonstrated. Further analyses reveal PAC-S to be more robust to identifying hallucinated objects in captions and better at assessing performance of latest image/video captioning models. Overall, PAC-S sets a new state-of-the-art for learning evaluation metrics in a data-efficient way by combining real and synthetic data. The effectiveness of PAC-S highlights the potential of leveraging AI-generated data to train better machine learning models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new evaluation metric for image and video captioning called PAC-S (Positive-Augmented Contrastive learning Score). The key ideas are:

- Start with a pre-trained cross-modal model like CLIP that encodes images and text into a common embedding space. Finetune the model on cleaned image-caption data like COCO to adapt it to the captioning task. 

- Augment the training data with additional positive examples by generating new images from captions using a text-to-image model, and generating new captions from images using an image captioning model. These act as extra positive training examples.

- Train the model using a contrastive loss that maximizes similarity between real and generated matching image-text pairs, and minimizes similarity between non-matching pairs. This is called positive-augmented contrastive learning.

- The trained model can then score a candidate caption by encoding it and the image, and computing their cosine similarity in the joint space. Additional tricks like using reference captions can further improve performance.

- Experiments on Flickr8k, COCO, and video datasets show the proposed PAC-S metric outperforms prior work like CLIP-Score in correlating with human judgments. It also better detects caption hallucinations compared to other metrics.

In summary, the key novelty is augmenting contrastive learning with generated positives, rather than just training on cleaned data. This provides more supervision and tailors the joint embedding to the captioning task.
