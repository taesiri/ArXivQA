# [Graph Pruning for Enumeration of Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Graph Pruning for Enumeration of Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets":

Problem:
- Finding all Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUSes) of unsatisfiable constraint sets is important for analyzing overconstrained systems, but is very computationally expensive due to the huge search space.
- Existing MUS enumeration algorithms are still too slow for many real-world applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent boolean constraint formulas as graphs, where variables/clauses are nodes and edges connect variables to the clauses they appear in.  
- Learn a Graph Neural Network model to predict which clauses to remove from the formula while maintaining unsatisfiability. This prunes the search space.
- Formulate it as a node labeling problem - the model predicts a 0/1 vector indicating which clause nodes to keep.  
- Train with a custom loss function that encourages aggressive pruning while keeping formulas unsatisfiable.
- Combine the pruning model with existing MUS enumerators like MARCO, REMUS, TOME to accelerate them.

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea of using graph pruning to reduce search space for MUS enumeration. Converts formulas to graphs and tackles pruning as a node labeling problem.
- Custom graph generation procedure to create training formulas resembling real constraints.
- Weak supervision training scheme - does not require actual MUS labels, just needs to check if pruned formulas are unsatisfiable.
- Pruning helps enumerate more MUSes than without pruning for most solvers, especially REMUS. Benefits increase with more time.
- Trained model generalizes to larger unseen formulas. Also works on real-world problems without retraining.
- Releasing model and code to help accelerate MUS enumeration in other applications.

In summary, the paper proposes a learning-based graph pruning strategy to significantly reduce the search space for MUS enumeration without destroying satisfiability. This accelerates existing solvers and generalizes across problems.
