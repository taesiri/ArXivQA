# Patch n' Pack: NaViT, a Vision Transformer for any Aspect Ratio and
  Resolution

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central hypothesis of this paper seems to be that Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be trained more efficiently and achieve better performance by using variable resolution inputs and a technique called "patch n' pack" during training. Specifically, the authors propose an approach called NaViT (Native Resolution ViT) which packs multiple image patches from different images into a single sequence during training. This allows handling images of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. The main claims made are:- Patch n' pack enables more efficient training of ViTs by allowing variable resolution inputs. This increases the number of training examples that can be processed in a given compute budget.- NaViT achieves higher performance compared to standard ViTs when matched for training compute.- A single NaViT model can handle multiple resolutions at test time, enabling flexible tradeoffs between performance and computational cost.- NaViT transfers well to downstream tasks like image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. It also shows improved robustness and fairness metrics.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that patch n' pack and variable resolution training improves efficiency, performance and flexibility of Vision Transformers. The paper aims to demonstrate this through extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, transfer learning, and other vision tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing NaViT (Native Resolution ViT), a modified Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that can process inputs of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This is achieved through sequence packing during training, where patches from multiple images are packed into a single sequence. 2. Demonstrating that NaViT leads to improved training efficiency compared to regular ViT models, for both supervised image classification pretraining on large datasets like JFT-4B as well as contrastive image-text pretraining. The efficiency gains come from being able to process a greater number of variable resolution images within a fixed training budget.3. Showing that NaViT can be transferred effectively to standard computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation etc. It also leads to improved performance on robustness and fairness benchmarks compared to ViT baselines.4. Leveraging the flexibility of NaViT at inference time to smoothly trade off between performance and computational cost by adjusting the input resolution. A single NaViT model achieves excellent performance over a wide range of resolutions.5. Proposing the "Patch n' Pack" training paradigm which enables packing of variable resolution image patches into sequences. This unlocks new research possibilities and ideas that were previously constrained by fixed batch shapes required for standard ViT training.In summary, the key innovation is enabling ViT models to handle arbitrary resolutions through sequence packing, which confers advantages in training efficiency, inference flexibility and performance across a variety of vision tasks. The proposed NaViT architecture and Patch n' Pack training paradigm mark a promising research direction for Vision Transformers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately I do not have enough context to summarize the full paper in one sentence, since it was just LaTeX code defining the document structure without the actual content. However, based on the title and section headings, it seems to be introducing a new vision transformer model called NaViT that can process images of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. The key ideas appear to be using sequence packing during training to handle variable image sizes, and modified positional embeddings to support different resolutions. The claimed benefits are improved training efficiency, flexibility at inference time to trade off cost and performance, and better generalization as evidenced by performance on robustness benchmarks. In summary, NaViT aims to depart from the standard approach of resizing images to a fixed resolution before feeding them to a model, and instead natively supports variable image sizes in an efficient transformer framework.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other research on vision transformers:- The core idea of using sequence packing (Patch n' Pack) during training to handle variable input resolutions and aspect ratios is novel. Prior work like FlexiViT and Pix2Struct introduced some flexibility in input sizes, but not to the same degree through packing.- The improved training efficiency from resolution sampling and continuous token dropping has not been demonstrated before. This allows NaViT models to be trained on more data in the same compute budget.- Using factorized positional embeddings to handle arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios is a new approach compared to prior work like ViT and Pix2Struct. The experiments show this works better, especially for generalization.- Evaluating the same NaViT model smoothly across resolutions is unique. Most prior ViT research focuses on a fixed resolution. This allows flexible cost-performance trade-offs at test time.- The work does not use hierarchical multi-scale feature maps like some other vision transformers (MViT, UViT, etc.). The authors argue this may not be necessary for many tasks.- There is limited prior work studying vision transformer performance on robustness benchmarks like ImageNet-A. The gains of NaViT in these experiments highlight the benefits of flexible resolutions.- The improved annotation accuracy for fairness attributes is a novel finding demonstrating the advantages of preserving aspect ratios.Overall, the core ideas and experiments around resolution flexibility with Patch n' Pack seem unique to this paper compared to prior ViT research. The results highlight interesting advantages, especially for efficiency and robustness, that warrant further investigation in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring different Patch n' Pack packing algorithms, like bin packing, to further minimize padding and maximize efficiency.- Developing better strategies for continuous token dropping during training, like importance-based dropping or structured dropping, to improve performance.- Combining the flexibility of Patch n' Pack with hierarchical multi-scale vision transformer architectures that use feature maps at multiple resolutions. This could help for localization tasks like segmentation and detection.- Applying Patch n' Pack to video modeling, allowing variable spatial and temporal resolutions during training and inference.- Developing adaptive computation techniques to dynamically allocate computation at inference time based on input difficulty. Patch n' Pack enables this by supporting variable sequence lengths.- Exploring automated ways to find optimal trade-offs between model performance, input resolution, and computational cost at inference time. The flexibility of Patch n' Pack creates many options here.- Applying ideas enabled by fixed batch shapes with Patch n' Pack, like aspect ratio preserving resolution sampling and variable token dropping rates, to inspire new techniques.In summary, the authors suggest many promising avenues to further improve training efficiency, model performance, inference cost-performance trade-offs, and inspiration for new techniques. Patch n' Pack seems to open a lot of possibilities for future Vision Transformer research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces NaViT (Native Resolution Vision Transformer), a modification of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that enables processing images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. Rather than resizing input images to a fixed resolution like standard ViTs, NaViT packs together variable-sized image patches into sequences during training. This "patch n' pack" allows models to train on native image resolutions. Experiments show NaViT improves training efficiency and downstream performance compared to fixed-resolution ViTs. It also enables smoothly trading off cost and accuracy at inference by evaluating the same model on varied input resolutions. Key benefits include higher throughput and exposure to more training data from mixed resolutions, better generalization and robustness, and flexible inference. Overall, NaViT demonstrates a promising new direction for vision transformers by avoiding constraints imposed by CNN-style fixed image sizes and leveraging sequence modeling flexibility.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents NaViT (Native Resolution Vision Transformer), a modified Vision Transformer architecture that can process images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. NaViT uses a technique called Patch n' Pack, where patches from multiple images are packed together into a single sequence for more efficient training. This allows NaViT models to be trained on images at their native resolutions, without requiring resizing or cropping to a fixed size. The authors demonstrate that NaViT models can be trained much more efficiently than standard Vision Transformers, achieving better performance with 4x less compute during pretraining. NaViT also enables flexible inference, with a single model able to smoothly trade off performance and compute cost by adjusting the input resolution. Experiments show NaViT has improved robustness, fairness, and transfer learning abilities compared to ViT baselines.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces NaViT (Native Resolution Vision Transformer), which enables training and evaluating vision transformers on images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This is achieved through a technique called Patch n' Pack, where patches from multiple images are packed together into one sequence for more efficient training. NaViT makes architectural modifications to the original ViT to support packing, including masked self-attention and pooling, factorized positional embeddings, and modifications to handle variable sequence lengths.

By packing together variable resolution images, NaViT is able to train on more images in a given compute budget. Experiments demonstrate NaViT's improved training efficiency in supervised classification and contrastive learning settings, as well as strong performance when transferred to tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. A key advantage is the ability to smoothly trade off cost and performance at inference time by evaluating at different resolutions.
