# [Two-in-One Depth: Bridging the Gap Between Monocular and Binocular   Self-supervised Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00933)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Is it feasible to develop a general model that can compatibly handle both monocular (single image) and binocular (stereo image pair) self-supervised depth estimation, while also improving prediction accuracy compared to separate models for each task?The key points are:- Monocular and binocular depth estimation are closely related tasks, but typically handled by separate models. - The authors propose that a single "two-in-one" model that can do both tasks could have advantages in flexibility, efficiency and performance.- They develop a model called TiO-Depth to explore this idea. It uses a Siamese architecture so each sub-network can act as a monocular model, plus additional modules to incorporate stereo knowledge for binocular estimation.- A multi-stage training strategy is proposed to leverage the strengths of both tasks and improve monocular and binocular performance.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a single two-in-one model can effectively handle both monocular and binocular depth estimation in a self-supervised manner, with performance advantages over specialized separate models. The TiO-Depth model and training approach are presented to explore this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The dual-path decoder and joint training strategy help achieve this.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a two-in-one neural network called TiO-Depth for self-supervised monocular and binocular depth estimation, which employs a Siamese architecture so that each sub-network can handle monocular depth prediction while the full network aggregates features from both views for binocular depth prediction using proposed monocular feature matching modules.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in self-supervised monocular and binocular depth estimation:- The main contribution is proposing a single model (TiO-Depth) that can perform both monocular and binocular depth estimation in a self-supervised manner. Most prior works have focused on one task or the other, not a unified model.- For monocular depth estimation, TiO-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other self-supervised methods on KITTI, outperforming recent works like EPCDepth, SDFA-Net, etc. The architecture using switched dual paths and distillation helps with this.- For binocular/stereo depth estimation, TiO-Depth also achieves very competitive results to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods like StereoNet, H-Net, etc. The dual path design and monocular feature matching helps leverage stereo training data.- The model is designed in an efficient way, with shared encoders and decoders between the monocular and binocular tasks. This reduces parameters versus separate models.- The training strategy leverages advantages of both monocular and binocular training through multi-stage joint training and distillation. This helps improve both tasks.- TiO-Depth shows good cross-dataset generalization, performing well on Cityscapes and DDAD when trained only on KITTI. This demonstrates its robustness.Overall, by proposing a unified model for both tasks, strong architectural designs, and an effective training strategy, this work pushes forward self-supervised depth estimation and shows promising results compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. The two-in-one approach is novel and could be useful for platforms needing flexibility between monocular and binocular inputs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further exploring architectures and training strategies for building general depth estimation models that can handle both monocular and binocular tasks well. The authors propose TiO-Depth as an initial model, but suggest there is room for improvement.- Developing techniques to better leverage the relative advantages and disadvantages of monocular vs. binocular depth estimation. The authors propose combining them via distillation and using occlusion masks, but more advanced fusion strategies could help further. - Applying the ideas of monocular feature matching to other vision tasks like optical flow or visual odometry that can utilize both monocular and binocular cues. The MFM module may have broader applicability.- Evaluating the benefits of a single general depth model vs separate specialized models in real-world systems in terms of efficiency, robustness, etc. This could better motivate development of unified architectures.- Expanding the joint training approach to include other self-supervised signals like pose, flow, segmentation, etc. Jointly optimizing over multiple tasks could improve overall performance.- Testing the approach on more diverse datasets like outdoor driving scenes, indoor environments, etc. This could reveal domain gaps and lead to more robust models.In summary, the authors suggest continuing to explore unified network architectures, advanced training techniques, and applications to other tasks/datasets as directions to build on their proposed TiO-Depth model. The goal is developing more flexible, efficient and accurate depth estimation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a Two-in-One self-supervised depth estimation network called TiO-Depth, which can handle both monocular and binocular depth estimation tasks. TiO-Depth uses a Siamese architecture where each sub-network can be used as a monocular depth estimation model. For binocular depth estimation, it incorporates a Monocular Feature Matching (MFM) module to match and fuse features from the two sub-networks to incorporate stereo knowledge. The authors also propose a multi-stage joint training strategy to leverage the advantages of both tasks and boost performance. In experiments, TiO-Depth is trained on KITTI and evaluated on KITTI, Cityscapes and DDAD datasets. Results show it outperforms state-of-the-art monocular and binocular methods on most metrics. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the MFM module and training strategy. The results demonstrate TiO-Depth can accurately estimate depth from both single images and stereo image pairs in a unified model, with improved performance over separate monocular and binocular models. The paper provides useful insights into designing unified networks for both tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a two-in-one self-supervised depth estimation model called TiO-Depth, which can handle both monocular and binocular depth estimation tasks. TiO-Depth uses a Siamese network architecture where each sub-network consists of a monocular feature encoder and a dual-path decoder. The dual-path decoder contains a monocular path and a binocular path with monocular feature matching (MFM) modules. For monocular depth estimation, only one sub-network is used by passing image features through the monocular path. For binocular depth estimation, both sub-networks are utilized to extract features from a stereo pair and the MFM modules fuse the features from the two networks to incorporate stereo geometry. The model is trained in a multi-stage strategy that helps improve performance on both tasks. This allows the same TiO-Depth model to estimate depths from either single images or stereo pairs in a self-supervised manner.
