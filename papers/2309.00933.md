# [Two-in-One Depth: Bridging the Gap Between Monocular and Binocular   Self-supervised Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00933)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Is it feasible to develop a general model that can compatibly handle both monocular (single image) and binocular (stereo image pair) self-supervised depth estimation, while also improving prediction accuracy compared to separate models for each task?The key points are:- Monocular and binocular depth estimation are closely related tasks, but typically handled by separate models. - The authors propose that a single "two-in-one" model that can do both tasks could have advantages in flexibility, efficiency and performance.- They develop a model called TiO-Depth to explore this idea. It uses a Siamese architecture so each sub-network can act as a monocular model, plus additional modules to incorporate stereo knowledge for binocular estimation.- A multi-stage training strategy is proposed to leverage the strengths of both tasks and improve monocular and binocular performance.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a single two-in-one model can effectively handle both monocular and binocular depth estimation in a self-supervised manner, with performance advantages over specialized separate models. The TiO-Depth model and training approach are presented to explore this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a novel self-supervised depth estimation network called TiO-Depth, which can handle both monocular and binocular depth estimation in a single model. 2. Designing a dual-path decoder with Monocular Feature Matching (MFM) modules to aggregate features from either single images or stereo pairs. This provides a way to build a unified model for both tasks.3. Proposing a multi-stage joint training strategy to train the TiO-Depth model. This helps improve performance on both monocular and binocular depth estimation. 4. Demonstrating through experiments that TiO-Depth outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both monocular and binocular depth estimation on multiple datasets. This verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of a single two-in-one network for both tasks.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a unified depth estimation model TiO-Depth that can handle both monocular and binocular depth prediction in a compatible way while improving accuracy over separate models for each task. The dual-path decoder and joint training strategy help achieve this.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a two-in-one neural network called TiO-Depth for self-supervised monocular and binocular depth estimation, which employs a Siamese architecture so that each sub-network can handle monocular depth prediction while the full network aggregates features from both views for binocular depth prediction using proposed monocular feature matching modules.
