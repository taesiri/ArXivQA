# [Investigating White-Box Attacks for On-Device Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- On-device deep learning models are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices for privacy and efficiency reasons. However, they are vulnerable to attacks since attackers can easily extract them from mobile apps.
- Existing attack methods rely on surrogate models since on-device models like TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) cannot compute gradients needed for white-box attacks. This makes attacks less effective.
- The paper argues that the lack of ability to directly attack on-device models underestimates their vulnerability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Reverse Engineering framework for On-device Models (REOM) to automatically transform non-debuggable TFLite models into debuggable PyTorch models.
- This enables direct white-box attacks without needing surrogate models.

Key Steps of REOM:
1) Extract TFLite model from app
2) Convert to intermediate ONNX model 
3) Apply 3 modifier modules to fix errors:
   - Pruning module: Fixes structure compatibility errors
   - Translation module: Handles mismatched operators
   - Auto-matching module: Matches unsupported ops to supported ones
4) Convert modified ONNX model to debuggable PyTorch model

Experiments and Results:
- Evaluated on 244 real-world TFLite models. REOM achieves 92.6% transformation success rate versus 6.6% for baseline tools.
- Transformed models have very small output differences from originals in most cases.
- Case studies show REOM enables more effective attacks - achieving 89.03% attack success rate with 100x smaller perturbations versus 10.23% rate for surrogate model attacks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first framework to automatically transform on-device models into debuggable versions
- Enables direct white-box attacks to accurately evaluate vulnerability of on-device models
- Findings show current deployment strategies seriously underestimate risks and need to use REOM-based methods

In summary, the paper makes a novel contribution in enabling direct attacks on deployed on-device models to evaluate their risks, overcoming the limitations of existing surrogate model approaches. The proposed REOM framework automatically transforms models to debuggable versions which experiments show can lead to more effective attacks.
