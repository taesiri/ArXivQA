# [Investigating White-Box Attacks for On-Device Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- On-device deep learning models are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices for privacy and efficiency reasons. However, they are vulnerable to attacks since attackers can easily extract them from mobile apps.
- Existing attack methods rely on surrogate models since on-device models like TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) cannot compute gradients needed for white-box attacks. This makes attacks less effective.
- The paper argues that the lack of ability to directly attack on-device models underestimates their vulnerability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Reverse Engineering framework for On-device Models (REOM) to automatically transform non-debuggable TFLite models into debuggable PyTorch models.
- This enables direct white-box attacks without needing surrogate models.

Key Steps of REOM:
1) Extract TFLite model from app
2) Convert to intermediate ONNX model 
3) Apply 3 modifier modules to fix errors:
   - Pruning module: Fixes structure compatibility errors
   - Translation module: Handles mismatched operators
   - Auto-matching module: Matches unsupported ops to supported ones
4) Convert modified ONNX model to debuggable PyTorch model

Experiments and Results:
- Evaluated on 244 real-world TFLite models. REOM achieves 92.6% transformation success rate versus 6.6% for baseline tools.
- Transformed models have very small output differences from originals in most cases.
- Case studies show REOM enables more effective attacks - achieving 89.03% attack success rate with 100x smaller perturbations versus 10.23% rate for surrogate model attacks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first framework to automatically transform on-device models into debuggable versions
- Enables direct white-box attacks to accurately evaluate vulnerability of on-device models
- Findings show current deployment strategies seriously underestimate risks and need to use REOM-based methods

In summary, the paper makes a novel contribution in enabling direct attacks on deployed on-device models to evaluate their risks, overcoming the limitations of existing surrogate model approaches. The proposed REOM framework automatically transforms models to debuggable versions which experiments show can lead to more effective attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a reverse engineering framework called REOM that can automatically transform non-debuggable on-device deep learning models like TensorFlow Lite into debuggable versions to enable more effective white-box security testing and evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a complete Reverse Engineering framework for On-device Models (REOM) to convert compiled on-device models like TensorFlow Lite models into their corresponding debuggable versions like PyTorch models.

2. REOM can transform models automatically through dedicated strategies to handle compatibility errors, not implemented errors, and input type errors that arise during model conversion. Experiments show it can successfully transform over 90% of TensorFlow Lite models into debuggable PyTorch models.

3. The paper shows that attackers can achieve much higher attack success rates (10.23% -> 89.03%) with smaller perturbations (1.0 -> 0.01) by attacking the debuggable models converted by REOM compared to previous indirect white-box attacks. This demonstrates that on-device models can be directly attacked via white-box strategies enabled by REOM.

4. The findings emphasize the need for developers to carefully evaluate the vulnerability of their on-device models before deployment. REOM can serve as an essential tool to test the security of on-device models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the REOM framework to automatically transform on-device models into debuggable versions to enable direct white-box attacks, revealing that current on-device models are at serious security risk which is previously underestimated.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Reverse engineering
- On-device models
- TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)
- Debuggable models
- Model transformation
- Adversarial attacks
- White-box attacks
- Model security and vulnerabilities
- ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
- Modifier modules (Pruning, Translation, Auto-matching)
- Model accuracy and similarity

The paper proposes a reverse engineering framework called REOM to transform on-device TFLite models into debuggable PyTorch models. This allows white-box attacks to evaluate the security and vulnerabilities of on-device models, which was not previously possible. The framework uses ONNX as an intermediate representation and includes automated modules to modify the ONNX model to make it compatible for transformation to a debuggable format. Experiments show REOM can effectively transform over 90% of TFLite models accurately for security analysis purposes. So the core focus is on reverse engineering black-box on-device models to white-box debuggable models to enable more effective security testing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions three types of errors that can occur when trying to transform TFLite models into PyTorch models - Compatibility Errors, Not Implemented Errors, and Input Type Errors. Can you explain in more detail what causes each of these errors and why they prevent successful transformation?

2. The Pruning Module is designed to handle Compatibility Errors related to structure mismatch. Walk through an example of how a structure mismatch would occur and specifically how the Pruning Module identifies and removes the problematic extra operators to resolve this. 

3. The Translation Module handles operator mismatch errors by translating unsupported TFLite operators into combinations of basic ONNX operators. Pick one example TFLite operator that causes this error and explain step-by-step how the Translation Module would translate it into debuggable ONNX operators.

4. Explain the process used by the Auto-matching Module to handle custom or deprecated TFLite operators that are not supported in PyTorch. Walk through its steps of computing operator similarity, ranking potential matches, and validating function similarity.  

5. The method relies heavily on the ONNX platform for model interoperability. Discuss the key benefits of basing the transformation process on ONNX compared to a more direct TFLite-to-PyTorch conversion. What challenges would that approach face?

6. How exactly does the Modifier module coordinate between the Pruning, Translation, and Auto-matching modules? Walk through the control flow and explain how decisions are made regarding which module to apply to a given error.

7. The accuracy evaluation relies on comparing model outputs between original and transformed models. Discuss the limitations or potential threats to validity of using this output similarity metric to quantify transformation accuracy. What other metrics could be used?

8. For the attack evaluation, explain why indirect white-box attacks using surrogate models typically underperform compared to direct white-box attacks enabled by the proposed method. What key capability makes the direct attacks stronger?

9. The paper mentions some potential defensive strategies against reverse engineering attacks like model splitting or obfuscation. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches - would they be effective deterrents? Why or why not?

10. How might the proposed transformation approach need to evolve in future work to handle updates to TFLite or advances in on-device runtimes? What aspects seem most susceptible to breaking from continued development of mobile ML frameworks?
