# [Synergizing Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for   Open-Domain Urban Itinerary Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper introduces a new task called Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP). OUIP aims to automatically generate personalized urban travel itineraries that align with users' preferences and constraints expressed in natural language requests. This is different from traditional itinerary planning methods which rely on predefined categories or constraints and lacks personalization. Planning high-quality itineraries for city walks presents unique challenges compared to conventional tourism, requiring the ability to handle dynamic information, fine-grained constraints, and customization of routes.

Proposed Solution - ItiNera System:
The paper proposes a holistic system called ItiNera to address the OUIP problem. ItiNera incorporates five key components:

1) User-owned POI Collection: Automatically aggregates latest POIs from social media to construct a personalized, up-to-date POI database. 

2) Request Decomposition: Leverages LLM to decompose free-text user request into structured sub-requests for better interpretation.

3) POI Retrieval: Employs embedding-based method to retrieve candidate POIs that match user preferences.

4) Spatial Optimization: Clusters relevant POIs spatially and solves Constrained TSP to order POIs for coherence.  

5) Itinerary Generation: Uses LLM to select and sequence POIs from candidates to generate personalized itinerary adhering to constraints.

ItiNera strategically combines the strengths of LLMs and spatial optimizations to produce high-quality OUIP solutions personalized to users' requests.

Main Contributions:

- Formalizes the novel problem of OUIP which aims to generate personalized urban itineraries from free-text user inputs.

- Develops ItiNera, an end-to-end system incorporating LLMs with spatial optimization to address OUIP with personalization and coherence.

- Proposes comprehensive metrics employing both rules and GPT-based assessments for evaluating OUIP solutions.

- Conducts extensive experiments on real-world data and user studies which validate ItiNera's ability to produce superior quality personalized and coherent itineraries.

- Deploys ItiNera in production at TuTu serving thousands of users for their city exploration planning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an open-domain urban itinerary planning system called ItiNera that integrates large language models with spatial optimization to generate personalized and spatially coherent travel itineraries directly from users' natural language requests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the problem of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which aims to generate personalized urban travel itineraries based on users' natural language requests. This is a new problem formulation not addressed in prior work. 

2. It proposes a holistic system called \textsc{ItiNera} to address the OUIP problem. \textsc{ItiNera} synergizes spatial optimization techniques with large language models (LLMs) to create personalized, spatially coherent itineraries. Specifically, it features modules for user-owned POI collection, request decomposition, POI retrieval, spatial optimization, and itinerary generation.

3. It designs comprehensive metrics employing both rule-based and GPT-based evaluations to measure the quality and personalization of generated itineraries. This provides a metric framework to guide future research on OUIP.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{ItiNera} outperforms baselines in crafting high-quality, personalized, spatially coherent itineraries aligned with user needs. It is also deployed in production to offer online OUIP services.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the new OUIP problem, the \textsc{ItiNera} system to address it, evaluation metrics, and experimental validation of the system's effectiveness both offline and in real-world deployment. This establishes a new research direction at the intersection of spatial optimization and LLMs.
