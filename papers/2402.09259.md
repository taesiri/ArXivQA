# [SyntaxShap: Syntax-aware Explainability Method for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explaining predictions from autoregressive language models (LMs) for text generation tasks remains an open challenge.
- Existing model-agnostic methods like LIME and SHAP don't consider syntax which is important for next token predictions.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces SyntaxShap, a local and model-agnostic explainability method that incorporates syntax using dependency parsing. 
- It extends Shapley values by constraining coalitions according to the dependency tree rather than considering all possible coalitions.
- It also proposes a weighted variant, SyntaxShap-W, that gives more importance to words higher up in the tree.

Contributions:
- SyntaxShap generates more faithful, coherent and semantically aligned explanations than baselines.
- The paper introduces new quantitative evaluation metrics tailored to stochastic LMs and qualitative metrics aligned with human expectations.
- Experiments on two LMs (GPT-2 and Mistral 7B) and three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SyntaxShap over baselines like LIME and Partition (a SHAP variant).
- SyntaxShap also scales better than the naive SHAP implementation while being comparably faithful.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to make SHAP explanations for text generation syntax-aware using dependency trees. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations highlight that this approach leads to superior explanation faithfulness and quality over non-syntax-aware approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SyntaxShap, a local, model-agnostic explainability method for text generation that incorporates syntax information from dependency parsing to produce more faithful, coherent, and semantically aligned explanations compared to other state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing SyntaxShap, a local, model-agnostic explainability method for text generation that takes into consideration the syntax in the text data. Specifically:

- SyntaxShap extends Shapley values to account for parsing-based syntactic dependencies when generating explanations. It takes a game theoretic approach but only considers coalitions of words that are constrained by the dependency tree structure.

- The paper evaluates SyntaxShap and a weighted variant on diverse metrics including faithfulness, complexity, coherency and semantic alignment of explanations. It shows that accounting for syntax produces explanations that are more faithful, coherent and interpretable compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- The paper also proposes new quantitative metrics to address the stochasticity of language models as well as qualitative metrics to account for human expectations of explanation quality.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating a novel syntax-aware approach to explaining text generation models that produces higher quality explanations compared to existing methods. The integration of syntactic structure and consideration of both model faithfulness and human interpretability expectations are the key innovations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper:

- SyntaxShap: The name of the explainability method introduced in the paper that takes into account syntax in the text data.

- Shapley values: A method from game theory that SyntaxShap is based on, used to assign importance scores to input features.

- Text generation: The type of task that SyntaxShap aims to explain, specifically next token prediction in autoregressive language models.  

- Model-agnostic: SyntaxShap is designed to work with any autoregressive language model, not tied to a specific model.

- Dependency parsing/tree: SyntaxShap uses the dependency parse of an input sentence to constrain the coalitions of words it considers when computing Shapley values.

- Faithfulness: A key evaluation metric checked in the paper - how well the explanations match the model's reasoning.

- Coherency: Another qualitative evaluation metric introduced to test if explanations change appropriately with changes in model predictions.

- Semantic alignment: An evaluation dimension assessing if decisive input tokens are properly reflected when they are not captured by the model prediction.

So in summary - SyntaxShap, Shapley values, text generation, dependency parsing, faithfulness, coherency, semantic alignment.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the SyntaxShap method proposed in the paper:

1. How does SyntaxShap incorporate syntactic structure from dependency parsing into the construction of Shapley value coalitions? What is the motivation behind constraining coalitions based on the dependency tree?

2. Explain in detail how SyntaxShap calculates the number of coalitions at each level of the dependency tree. Walk through the equations and provide an intuitive explanation. 

3. The paper claims SyntaxShap satisfies the symmetry and nullity axioms of Shapley values but violates efficiency and additivity. Elaborate on why it satisfies or violates each axiom. Are there any tradeoffs?

4. What is the time complexity of SyntaxShap and how does it compare to the na√Øve Shapley value computation? Provide the derivation of the time complexity.

5. Why does the paper propose a weighted version of SyntaxShap? What is the intuition behind weighing words differently based on their level in the dependency tree?

6. Besides fidelity, what new quantitative evaluation metrics are introduced in the paper? How do these metrics account for the stochasticity of language models?

7. Explain the motivation behind the qualitative evaluation metrics - coherency and semantic alignment. How are these metrics calculated and what do they measure?  

8. What are some of the key limitations of SyntaxShap discussed in the paper? How might incorrect dependency parse trees impact the performance?

9. How robust is SyntaxShap to sentences of varying lengths? Does the number of tokens affect the performance based on the results?

10. What opportunities exist for future work to integrate more linguistic knowledge into the evaluation of explainability methods? What specific ideas are discussed?
