# [Steady-State Error Compensation for Reinforcement Learning with   Quadratic Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- In reinforcement learning (RL), the choice of reward function impacts system performance. Quadratic reward functions can result in steady-state errors while absolute-value rewards cause state fluctuations.  

- This is problematic for control systems which require stability. Neither reward fully balances smooth control and small steady-state errors.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes new PI-based reward functions to address the limitations of quadratic and absolute-value rewards. 

- An integral term is introduced that accumulates the steady-state error over time. This integral penalty prompts the RL agent to prioritize long-term system stability.

- Two methods are presented to calculate the integral error to improve convergence speed and avoid tuning challenges.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates issues with quadratic and absolute-value reward functions in RL-based control systems through ACC and lane change simulations.  

- Validates that the proposed PI rewards significantly diminish steady-state errors while enabling smooth state transitions.

- The PI terms provide a principled way to tune RL rewards to balance smoothness and steady-state error, important for control systems.

- Overall, the paper introduces an integral reinforcement learning reward formulation to enhance stability in RL control problems. Experiments show reduced errors without fluctuation spikes.

In summary, the key innovation is using PI-rewards to stably balance smooth control and small steady-state errors in RL for control. The methods demonstrate clear improvements on ACC and lane change testbeds.
