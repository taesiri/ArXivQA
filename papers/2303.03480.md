# Can an Embodied Agent Find Your "Cat-shaped Mug"? LLM-Based Zero-Shot
  Object Navigation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper introduction, the central research question seems to be how can an embodied agent efficiently find and navigate to arbitrarily described objects in previously unseen environments. The key challenges outlined are:1) Humans describe objects with unconstrained, free-flowing language, which does not conform to rigid class labels that agents are typically trained on. This makes detecting and comprehending the target objects difficult. 2) The agent has not seen the environment before, so it cannot rely on maps or prior knowledge of object locations. It must explore and navigate in a "zero-shot" manner.3) Current simulation environments only contain common objects described with simple language, whereas real-world human environments contain many unique objects. There is a need to evaluate performance on detecting and navigating to these unique objects.4) Fully supervised learning approaches are impractical for this task, as the agent needs to generalize to new objects and environments. However, large pre-trained vision-language models may be able to provide the necessary generalization capability.The central hypothesis seems to be that by leveraging large pre-trained models like LLMs and VL models, an agent can effectively explore unknown environments and detect arbitrarily described objects in a zero-shot manner. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on a simulation benchmark and real-world robot platform.
