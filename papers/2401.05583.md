# [Diffusion Priors for Dynamic View Synthesis from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos aims to capture the temporal evolution of visual content within videos from a single moving camera. Existing methods struggle to distinguish between motion and structure, especially when camera motion is smaller compared to object motion. They also have difficulty hallucinating unseen regions occluded or out-of-view in the input video.

Method:
The authors propose a method called DpDy that leverages geometry priors from pretrained diffusion models to address these challenges. 

They represent the 4D scene using two NeRFs - one dynamic NeRF for non-rigid motions and one static NeRF for rigid background regions. The image rendering blends the output of these two NeRFs.

The NeRFs are optimized using two types of losses:
1) Reconstruction loss between rendered and input frames.
2) Score distillation sampling (SDS) loss that transfers knowledge from a pretrained RGB-D diffusion model to provide guidance for novel views.

To mitigate the domain gap between diffusion model training data and real videos, the RGB-D diffusion model is finetuned on the input video frames using a customization technique before distillation.

Contributions:
- First work to use 2D image diffusion priors for dynamic novel view supervision of real-world scenes. This allows robustly hallucinating occluded or unseen regions.

- Proposed method to finetune and distill knowledge from RGB-D diffusion models for providing geometry guidance.

- Achieve improved qualitative and quantitative performance on the challenging iPhone dataset compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key idea is leveraging large-scale generative diffusion models as priors to overcome limitations of previous geometric and physics-based priors for complex dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos by representing the scene with separate static and dynamic neural radiance fields and using knowledge distillation from a finetuned RGB-D diffusion model as guidance to hallucinate unseen regions and improve consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for dynamic 4D scene reconstruction from monocular videos using diffusion priors. Specifically:

1) The paper represents a 4D dynamic scene using two separate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) - one for rigid/static regions and another for dynamic regions. Image rendering is done by blending the output of these two NeRFs.

2) To supervise the novel view synthesis, the paper leverages guidance from an RGB-D diffusion model (LDM3D) using score distillation sampling. This provides geometry consistency for hallucinating unseen views.

3) To bridge the domain gap between LDM3D's training data and real-world video frames, the paper fine-tunes LDM3D on the input videos using a customization technique before distillation. This preserves the scene identity.

4) Experiments on a challenging real-world iPhone dataset demonstrate the advantage of using diffusion priors for dynamic novel view synthesis. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons show the robustness of the proposed method.

In summary, the key contribution is the incorporation of knowledge distillation from an appropriately customized RGB-D diffusion model to supervise the 4D reconstruction process for complex dynamic scenes. This enables more robust novel view synthesis compared to using only hand-crafted priors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Dynamic novel view synthesis - The paper focuses on synthesizing novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. This is the main task.

- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) - The method represents scenes using neural radiance fields, which encode scene geometry and appearance as an MLP. Two separate NeRFs are used, one for dynamic regions and one for static.

- Diffusion priors - The key novelty of the paper is using pretrained image diffusion models like LDM3D as priors to help supervise the view synthesis and hallucinate unseen content. Techniques like score matching distillation are used.

- Knowledge distillation - The knowledge and distributions learned in the diffusion models are distilled to help regularize the 4D NeRF scene representation.

- Dreambooth finetuning - Dreambooth is used to finetune the diffusion model on the input video frames to adapt it to the target data distribution while preserving scene identity.

- Evaluation on iPhone dataset - The method is evaluated on the challenging iPhone dataset which features complex real-world motions that are hard to reconstruct.

Some other terms include SDS loss, score distillation sampling, affine-invariant depth loss, mLPIPS, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
