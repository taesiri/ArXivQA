# [RotationDrag: Point-based Image Editing with Rotated Diffusion Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing point-based image editing methods using diffusion models make the assumption that image features remain constant during the editing process. This can cause issues with tracking handle points properly, leading to inaccurate edits, especially for rotations.

- The paper investigates the feature spaces of diffusion models and finds they perform poorly for in-plane rotations. This is likely because rotations are underrepresented in the training data.

- Many real-world image edits involve rotations, so improving performance for rotations is important for practical applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes RotationDrag, a point-based editing method focused on improving edits involving in-plane rotations. 

- During point tracking, RotationDrag calculates the rotation angle between initial and current handle points. It then rotates the input image accordingly and extracts features from this rotated image to locate the new handle points.

- This allows properly tracking points even with large rotational edits by matching to the feature space of the rotated image.

Main Contributions:
- First point-based editing method utilizing rotated image features to improve tracking for rotations.

- Introduction of RotateBench benchmark focused specifically on evaluating in-plane rotation edits.

- Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate RotationDrag's improved performance over baselines for rotation edits, while maintaining fidelity.

- Analysis provides insight into diffusion feature spaces and how they fail on rotated data, motivating the proposed solution.

In summary, the key innovation of RotationDrag is using rotated image features during point tracking to enable more accurate editing involving in-plane rotations. Experiments show this allows better edits than prior methods for rotations.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is proposing RotationDrag, a novel point-based image editing method that utilizes feature maps of rotated images to improve point tracking accuracy under in-plane rotation scenarios. Specifically, the key contributions summarized in the paper are:

1) Proposing RotationDrag, which uses feature maps of rotated images to guide point tracking for more accurate point-based editing when there is in-plane rotation.

2) Introducing RotationBench, the first benchmark dataset focused on evaluating point-based editing methods under in-plane rotation scenarios.

The paper proposes a novel point-based image editing method called RotationDrag that utilizes the feature maps of rotated images to improve performance, especially for in-plane rotation manipulations. It investigates the feature space of diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and finds they perform poorly on estimating homographies for in-plane rotated images. To address this, RotationDrag rotates input images to extract more reliable features for tracking handle points during optimization. The paper also introduces a new benchmark dataset called RotateBench to focus on in-plane rotation scenarios. So the key terms revolve around point-based editing, diffusion models, feature space analysis, rotation manipulations, and the proposed RotationDrag method and RotateBench dataset.
