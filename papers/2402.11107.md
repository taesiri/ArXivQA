# [Dynamic nowcast of the New Zealand greenhouse gas inventory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- New Zealand's national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories have a long time lag of 15-27 months and are only released annually. This limits their usefulness for policymakers. 
- More frequent (e.g. quarterly) and timely emissions data is needed to track progress towards climate change targets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a machine learning model to estimate New Zealand's national GHG emissions at a daily frequency with a latency of 2 months. 
- The model focuses on the main emitting sectors - Energy (41.2% of emissions) and Agriculture (48.8%).
- For each sector, a small set of 4-6 "indicator" variables related to emissions drivers are used as inputs to the model.

Methodology:
- Multiple machine learning models are evaluated, with Extra Trees selected as the best performing.
- Model accuracy, stability, and resistance to overfitting are assessed via cross-validation. 
- Median error rates of 1.3% (Agriculture) and 3.2% (Energy) are achieved.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates feasibility of using machine learning with limited inputs to estimate national emissions more frequently and with lower latency.
- Provides daily estimates that allow more granular tracking of emissions trends.
- Methodology complements official annual inventory and can be updated as new editions are released.  
- Preliminary forecasts of 2021 emissions are made for the Agriculture (-0.03%) and Energy (+0.99%) sectors.
- Approach enables comparisons of short-term emissions impacts (e.g. COVID lockdowns vs Global Financial Crisis).

The model has some limitations in terms of inputs, explanation, and uncertainty, but overall it shows promise as a timely emissions tracking tool to support climate policy in New Zealand.
