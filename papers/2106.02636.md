# [MERLOT: Multimodal Neural Script Knowledge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02636)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that learning from unlabeled videos and their transcripts can produce models with improved commonsense reasoning and temporal understanding, compared to learning from static images paired with captions. 

Specifically, the authors introduce a model called MERLOT that is pretrained on a large corpus of YouTube videos and ASR transcripts in a self-supervised manner, without any human annotations. They hypothesize that by training the model with objectives that involve contextualizing frames over time, matching frames to contextualized transcripts, and temporal reordering, MERLOT will learn improved multimodal representations that transfer better to downstream tasks requiring temporal reasoning.

The paper then validates this hypothesis through experiments showing that MERLOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on a diverse set of 12 video and image QA datasets when finetuned. Additional analyses provide evidence that:

- Pretraining on videos works better than static images
- Using a large and diverse video corpus improves performance 
- The model continues improving with more pretraining, suggesting the representations have not saturated

Overall, the central hypothesis is that self-supervised pretraining on videos can learn improved temporal commonsense reasoning, which the paper aims to validate through the MERLOT model and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. They introduce MERLOT, a model that learns multimodal script knowledge by self-supervised pretraining on large amounts of unlabelled YouTube videos and transcripts.

2. They collect and curate a new diverse dataset called YT-Temporal-180M from 6 million YouTube videos for pretraining MERLOT. This dataset covers a wide range of everyday events and situations.

3. They propose a combination of pretraining objectives like contrastive frame-transcript matching, masked language modeling with attention masking, and temporal reordering that allows MERLOT to learn full-stack visual reasoning from recognition to cognition level. 

4. Extensive experiments show MERLOT achieves new state-of-the-art results on 12 video QA datasets when finetuned, demonstrating its strong multimodal and temporal representations.

5. Ablation studies provide insights into the benefits of training on diverse video data, using multiple complementary pretraining objectives, and continuing to pretrain for more iterations.

6. Qualitative analyses illustrate MERLOT's capability for temporal commonsense reasoning in zero-shot settings like ordering scrambled image sequences into coherent narratives.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the MERLOT model to learn rich multimodal script knowledge from unlabeled videos at scale, and showing its effectiveness on a variety of static and video reasoning tasks. The new pretraining dataset, objectives, and analyses are also key contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MERLOT, a model that learns multimodal script knowledge by self-supervised pretraining on 6 million unlabelled YouTube videos with speech transcripts, achieving state-of-the-art performance when finetuned on 12 different video QA datasets and demonstrating strong zero-shot temporal reasoning ability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on learning temporal commonsense reasoning from videos and their transcripts in a self-supervised manner. Much prior work has focused on learning from image-caption pairs, which provide more literal descriptions of static images. Learning from videos and transcripts allows the model to learn richer representations of events unfolding over time.

- The approach trains the model using a combination of objectives at both the frame level (e.g. matching frames to contextualized transcripts) and the video level (e.g. unmasking words and reordering scrambled frames). This encourages the model to learn full-stack reasoning spanning both recognition and cognition. Other work has often focused more narrowly on either visual recognition or high-level reasoning.

- The model achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of 12 video and image reasoning benchmarks when finetuned. This demonstrates the versatility of the self-supervised pretraining approach across different types of reasoning. Other models relying on supervised pretraining tend to be more domain-specific.

- Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of diverse video data, temporal objectives, and long pretraining for learning rich commonsense knowledge. This highlights key factors in self-supervised learning that may not have been extensively analyzed in some prior work focusing on supervised pretraining.

- The model exhibits strong zero-shot transfer of temporal reasoning ability from videos to static images. This shows these skills effectively transfer across domains, whereas prior work has often focused learning on datasets from the same domain as the target task.

Overall, the self-supervised pretraining approach, objectives combining recognition and reasoning, strong and versatile results on many benchmarks, and ablation studies provide useful insights extending the current research direction of learning joint multimodal representations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring finer-grained temporal reasoning pretraining objectives beyond just frame ordering, such as temporal frame localization within transcripts. This could allow for more precise temporal alignment between visual and textual modalities.

- Learning multilingually from non-English videos and communities on YouTube. Given the relative limited availability of non-English multimodal annotated resources, a multilingual version of the model could be beneficial. 

- Further analysis of the model's attention patterns and behavior during reasoning. The authors suggest this could provide additional insights into how the model performs temporal multimodal reasoning.

- Scaling up the amount of data and compute used for pretraining even further. The results suggest continued pretraining could lead to additional performance gains.

- Investigating the risks and potential negative impacts of this video-and-language pretraining paradigm more thoroughly. The authors suggest follow-up work probing the limits and possible harms is important.

- Releasing more models, code, and data to the research community to facilitate further academic research into video-and-language pretraining. The authors hope their work inspires additional research in this direction.

In summary, the main future directions focus on scaling up the approach even further, mitigating risks, releasing research artifacts to inspire follow-up work, and developing more advanced pretraining objectives tailored to temporal multimodal reasoning. The results suggest video pretraining is a promising research direction worthy of continued investigation.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, this paper is addressing the challenge of teaching machines to reason about events and situations using common sense and temporal/causal relationships, beyond just literal static image descriptions. The key questions/problems it seems to be tackling are:

1. How can we train AI models to understand commonsense reasoning and make inferences about the past, present, and future of events/situations in images or videos? Literal image captions are limited in capturing this temporal reasoning. 

2. How can we teach such commonsense "script knowledge" without needing exhaustive supervised data labeling all possible facts, inferences, and counterfactuals?

3. Can models learn richer representations of events and situations by pretraining on large unlabeled video corpora (YouTube videos)?

4. What objectives and architectures allow models to learn these temporal/causal relationships from videos at both the frame level and global video level?

5. Can video pretraining transfer effectively to tasks involving static images that require understanding the dynamic context?

6. Does scaling up video data continue to improve commonsense reasoning capability, or does it plateau?

So in summary, it's trying to move beyond today's standard supervised pretraining on static images/captions to learn more human-like commonsense reasoning about events over time, using a large unlabeled video corpus. The key ideas are pretraining objectives for temporal reasoning and transfer learning to static image tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes learning multimodal representations by pretraining on unlabeled YouTube videos. What are some of the key challenges in using this type of web data for pretraining? For example, how does the noise and variability in YouTube videos compare to more curated image caption datasets?

2. The paper uses a hybrid ResNet/Transformer architecture for encoding video frames. Why was this design choice made over using more standard architectures like 3D CNNs? What are some of the tradeoffs in computational efficiency versus representative power? 

3. One of the pretraining objectives is contrastive frame-transcript matching. Why is this used in addition to the masked language modeling objective? What unique benefits does it provide for learning multimodal representations?

4. The paper finds that using attention weights to guide masking out words in the masked LM objective improves downstream task performance. Why might this attention-based masking strategy be more effective than random masking? How does it change what the model has to learn?
