# [An Automated End-to-End Open-Source Software for High-Quality   Text-to-Speech Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality datasets for training text-to-speech (TTS) models is challenging and labor-intensive, involving careful sample selection, recording, and annotation. 
- Existing tools lack capabilities to streamline and automate parts of this process to improve efficiency and quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an open-source end-to-end tool to expedite high-quality TTS dataset generation. 
- The tool automates sample selection, recording, quality assurance via ASR models, and preprocessing.

Sample Selection:
- Employs a novel iterative approach to select sentences that balance language-specific phoneme distribution for linguistic diversity.  
- Applies constraints on sentence type and length for balance.

Recording Process: 
- Provides interface for self-directed voice actor recordings following audio criteria.
- Supports batch recording with segmentation and automated labeling.

Quality Assurance:
- Uses ASR models to validate recordings, identify errors, and flag poor samples.  
- Annotation interface allows native speakers to ensure text-audio alignment, edit sentences, and discard poor samples.

Preprocessing:
- Trims recordings using voice activity detection.
- Saves data in formats compatible with TTS model training.

Key Contributions:
- Automates parts of TTS dataset creation to enhance efficiency and quality.
- Incorporates language-specific phoneme distribution for better coverage.   
- Leverages ASR and native annotators to assure quality.
- Provides modular and customizable open-source tool to benefit TTS research.
- Demonstrates high matching efficiency (~98%) and quality across languages.

In summary, the tool aims to streamline the labor-intensive process of generating TTS datasets, using automation and modeling techniques to improve efficiency as well as linguistic diversity and quality of the resulting datasets. Experiments confirm the tool's ability to produce high-quality datasets across multiple languages.
