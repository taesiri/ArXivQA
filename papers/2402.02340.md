# [Learning Semantic Proxies from Visual Prompts for Parameter-Efficient   Fine-Tuning in Deep Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02340)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep metric learning (DML) maps images to an embedding space where semantically similar images are closer. It is useful for image retrieval, human re-identification etc. 
- Recent DML methods use pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) as backbones. However, full fine-tuning of large ViTs on DML tasks is computationally expensive and can cause catastrophic forgetting. 
- Hence, the paper investigates parameter-efficient methods to fine-tune ViTs for DML.

Proposed Solution:
- Compares parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies like adapter modules, BitFit, visual prompt tuning (VPT) on DML benchmarks.
- Finds VPT to be most effective for DML.
- Proposes a novel framework to enhance VPT for DML using "semantic proxies". 
- Learns class-specific visual prompts to generate semantic proxies containing semantic information from the input image and ViT. 
- Accumulates proxies from multiple images of a class using GRU or EMA.
- Combines original random proxies as bias to handle classes not sampled in a batch.

Main Contributions:
- Compare parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for DML benchmarks.
- Propose effective VPT-based framework that learns semantic proxies to improve representational capacity and metric learning.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art DML performance while fine-tuning only 5.2% of parameters, with lower batch size and memory than full fine-tuning methods.
- Demonstrates parameter-efficient tuning for DML enables end users with limited compute to achieve competitive performance.

In summary, the paper explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for DML and proposes an improved VPT-based framework using semantic proxies that achieves excellent efficiency vs accuracy trade-off.
