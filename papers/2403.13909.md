# [Sequential Modeling of Complex Marine Navigation: Case Study on a   Passenger Vessel (Student Abstract)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reducing fuel consumption in ships is an important goal for the maritime industry to improve sustainability. 
- Existing models for predicting and optimizing ship fuel consumption have limitations in using real-time operator inputs, environmental factors, feature selection, handling non-stationary data, and integrating domain knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a time series forecasting model to predict dynamic states (location, speed, fuel consumption) of a ferry based on actions, static features, and disturbances.
- Use a dataset of operational data from a ferry over 2 years with over 3000 transits.
- Preprocess data for outlier removal, imputation, clustering operating modes, feature selection and engineering.
- Model uses Informer transformer for forecasting and a GRU to refine predictions and mitigate cumulative errors. Evaluated both non-auto-regressive and auto-regressive approaches.
- Created a Gym RL environment and dataset compatible with RL frameworks to optimize navigation and fuel efficiency. Uses curriculum learning strategy.

Main Contributions:
- Reality-based time series model to predict ferry states, using real operational data.
- Integrates domain knowledge in data preprocessing and modeling.
- Publicly available code, environment and dataset to facilitate future research.
- Lays foundation for future work in optimizing ship navigation and fuel efficiency with reinforcement learning.
- Evaluated on real data over thousands of trips and shows improved performance over baselines.

The paper tackles an important real-world problem using a data-driven approach, provides useful resources for future research, and validates the proposed methods on substantial real-world data.
