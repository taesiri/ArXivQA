# [Analysis of the Two-Step Heterogeneous Transfer Learning for Laryngeal   Blood Vessel Classification: Issue and Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transfer learning is commonly used in medical image classification to overcome limited dataset sizes. However, performance can suffer when transferring between highly distinct domains.  
- Two-step transfer learning has shown promise by using an intermediate domain to bridge the gap between source and target. But choosing an appropriate intermediate domain is critical.
- For rare medical images like laryngeal blood vessels, finding a large-scale intermediate dataset of the same modality/semantics is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate using a semantically different vascular dataset (diabetic retina) as intermediate domain in two-step transfer learning for laryngeal vessel classification. 
- Compare performance of 9 deep learning models using one-step (ImageNet -> target) and two-step (ImageNet -> diabetic retina -> target) transfer learning.
- Analyze attention maps from LayerCAM to understand feature differences causing performance drop.
- Propose Step-Wise Fine-Tuning (SWFT) method to incrementally fine-tune layers from back to front to regain performance.

Key Findings:  
- Two-step transfer causes 12.2% avg accuracy drop across models. Recall of malignant class drops 42.9% specifically.
- LayerCAM shows models lose ability to identify twisted/tangled vessels critical for malignancy after intermediate domain.
- Intermediate domain lacks these twisted vessel features despite both being vascular images. 
- SWFT recovers 26.1% and 20.4% accuracy for ResNet18 and 50, showing promise to overcome poor intermediate domain choice.
- Using ImageNet as source gives slight improvement over training from scratch, but not significant.

Main Contributions:
- First study of two-step transfer learning for laryngeal vessel classification.
- Finding that vascular intermediate domain can still be ineffective if lacks critical morphology features of target domain. 
- Proposed SWFT method to substantially regain performance lost from poor intermediate domain selection in two-step transfer learning.
- Summary of best performing models for laryngeal vessels under one-step transfer, two-step transfer, full training, and from scratch scenarios.
