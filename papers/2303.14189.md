# [FastViT: A Fast Hybrid Vision Transformer using Structural   Reparameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14189)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, this paper introduces FastViT, a new vision transformer architecture that aims to achieve improved speed and efficiency while maintaining high accuracy on computer vision tasks. 

The key research goal is to develop a hybrid vision transformer model that obtains state-of-the-art latency-accuracy trade-off compared to prior work. Specifically, the paper aims to answer:

- Can a hybrid vision transformer be designed to significantly improve speed and efficiency over prior hybrid models like CMT, while maintaining competitive accuracy? 

- What architectural innovations allow for faster processing suitable for real-time use cases, without sacrificing too much accuracy?

To address these questions, the paper proposes three main technical contributions:

1) A new token mixing block called RepMixer that uses structural reparameterization to remove skip connections and reduce memory access costs. 

2) Use of linear train-time overparameterization to boost model capacity at minimal cost to efficiency.

3) Replacements of some self-attention layers with large kernel convolutions to improve receptive field.

The central hypothesis is that by combining these ideas into a model called FastViT, it's possible to achieve much better speed and efficiency than prior hybrid models, while maintaining accuracy. Experiments validate this hypothesis, showing FastViT achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs on image classification, detection, segmentation and other vision tasks.

In summary, the key research question is whether architectural innovations like RepMixer and overparameterization can push vision transformers to new levels of efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The paper shows this is indeed possible with FastViT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing FastViT, a fast and efficient hybrid vision transformer architecture for computer vision. The key ideas are:

- Using a novel token mixing block called RepMixer that removes skip connections to reduce memory access costs and latency. 

- Applying train-time overparameterization to boost model capacity at minimal cost.

- Using large kernel convolutions as an efficient alternative to self-attention in early stages.

The combination of these techniques allows FastViT to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and latency trade-offs on image classification, detection, segmentation, and 3D tasks. The model is up to 4.9x faster than EfficientNet and 1.9x faster than ConvNeXt on mobile devices at similar accuracy levels.

The paper shows FastViT models consistently outperform other recent architectures like CMT, MobileNet, EfficientNet, etc. in terms of speed and efficiency across multiple computer vision applications and platforms. The models are also highly robust to image corruptions and out-of-distribution data while maintaining their speed advantages.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel fast vision transformer design that pushes state-of-the-art speed and efficiency for deployable computer vision models. The techniques like RepMixer and train-time overparameterization are generalizable to build other efficient models as well.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes FastViT, a fast hybrid vision transformer architecture for image classification and other vision tasks, which uses a novel RepMixer block and train-time overparameterization to reduce latency while maintaining accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in efficient vision transformer architectures:

- This paper introduces FastViT, a new hybrid vision transformer architecture optimized for latency and accuracy tradeoff across devices. Many recent works have explored hybrid architectures like CMT, Twins, and ConViT, but this paper shows FastViT significantly outperforms them in terms of latency on both mobile and GPU.

- A key innovation is the RepMixer block which removes skip connections to reduce memory access costs. This builds on concepts like RepVGG but is novel in the context of hybrid vision transformers. Structural reparameterization for efficiency has not been explored much before in this field.

- The paper shows FastViT models consistently outperform prior work across multiple vision tasks including classification, detection, segmentation, and 3D regression. Most prior efficient vision transformer papers focus evaluation on ImageNet classification only.

- The paper demonstrates FastViT has excellent robustness to corruptions and out-of-distribution data, unlike some other recent vision transformers like PVT. It also shows strong robustness compared to CNN models. This analysis of robustness in addition to accuracy is fairly unique.

- For comparable ImageNet accuracy, FastViT reduces parameters, FLOPs and latency considerably compared to models like EfficientNet, RegNet, Swin Transformers, and more. The extensive benchmarking on mobile and GPU is more thorough than most prior work.

- The approach is simplified compared to many recent designs - it does not require token labeling, dynamic convolutions, shifting, and other complex operations. This makes FastViT easy to implement and replicate.

Overall the paper shows how architectural choices like reparameterization and overparameterization can push vision transformers to new efficiency frontiers. The comprehensive evaluation and robustness analysis also differentiate FastViT from prior efficient vision transformer research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more efficient vision transformer architectures that achieve better latency-accuracy trade-offs. The authors propose some methods like RepMixer and train-time overparameterization, but suggest there is room for further improvements.

- Exploring ways to improve model robustness to corruptions and out-of-distribution samples. The authors show their model is quite robust, but robustness does not always correlate with accuracy. More work could be done to explicitly improve robustness.

- Applying the FastViT architecture to other vision tasks beyond image classification, detection, segmentation and 3D hand mesh regression. The authors show strong results on those tasks, but the architecture could likely be adapted to other tasks as well.

- Experimenting with different token mixing approaches besides RepMixer. The authors use RepMixer in early stages, but suggest trying other efficient alternatives to self-attention could be promising.

- Exploring model scaling - the authors mainly focus on smaller models <50M parameters. Trying larger model variants and scaling techniques could be interesting.

- Continuing to close the accuracy gap between hybrid conv-transformer models like FastViT and pure transformer models like ViT.

So in summary, the authors propose FastViT as a strong baseline architecture and suggest many promising research avenues along the themes of efficiency, robustness, scaling, and applying to new tasks and domains. Improving vision transformers and conv-transformer hybrids remains an active area of research.
