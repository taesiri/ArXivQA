# [Unlocking Structure Measuring: Introducing PDD, an Automatic Metric for   Positional Discourse Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BertScore are designed to measure fluency and semantic similarity, but cannot effectively evaluate the discourse coherence of long-form text generation. 
- There is a need for automatic evaluation methods that can assess the underlying structure and organization of generated articles.

Method - Positional Discourse Divergence (PDD):
- Proposes a novel metric called Positional Discourse Divergence (PDD) to quantify the divergence in discourse structure between a generated and reference article.  
- Divides sentences into N positional bins and computes KL divergence of discourse role distributions in each bin. More robust to local variations compared to exact sentence-level matching.
- Can be interpreted at different granularities based on choice of N. Converges to exact match when N is high.

Experiments and Results:
- Validated on three domains - news, QA, recipes. Uses respective genre-specific discourse schemas.
- Outperforms baseline metrics in correlating with human judgments and GPT-4 evaluations. Achieves substantial agreement on recipes which have stronger positional discourse constraints.  
- Consistently effective across domains, affirming that preserving discourse structure is vital for text coherence.

Contributions:
- Novel automatic method to assess discourse coherence without reliance on large LMs. Interpretable owing to use of KL divergence.
- Analysis provides insight on modeling discourse variations and choice of positional granularity.
- Highlights the need to generate text satisfying structural constraints, instead of just n-gram fluency.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Positional Discourse Divergence (PDD), a novel automatic metric to evaluate the underlying discourse structure and coherence of long-form text by quantifying the divergence between discourse role distributions in positional bins, and shows it aligns well with human preferences across three domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new automatic metric called Positional Discourse Divergence (PDD) to evaluate the discourse coherence of long-form text generation. Specifically:

- PDD is designed to quantify the divergence in discourse structure between a generated text and a reference text by dividing them into positional bins and calculating the KL divergence of discourse role distributions in each bin. This makes PDD more robust to local variations compared to simply matching discourse roles one-to-one.

- Experiments across three domains (news, long-form QA, recipes) show PDD has higher agreement with human judgments on coherence compared to existing metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, BertScore, and exact discourse role matching. 

- As a simple and model-free metric focused specifically on discourse, PDD helps address the need for better automatic evaluation of coherence in long-form text generation.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and validation of PDD as an effective automatic metric for evaluating discourse coherence in long-form text generation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Positional Discourse Divergence (PDD): The novel automatic metric proposed in the paper to quantify discourse divergence between long-form articles. It partitions sentences into positional bins and calculates divergence of discourse structures.

- Discourse structure: The organization of language into larger units like paragraphs and sections. The paper focuses on communicative functions of linguistic units.

- Discourse schemas: Different frameworks for defining discourse structure, like Rhetorical Structure Theory and Penn Discourse Treebank. 

- Functional discourse roles: Sentence-level roles that reflect the function each sentence plays in an article, defined differently for news, recipes, question answering.

- Coherence evaluation: Assessing how coherent and well-structured a generated long-form text is. Lexical metrics like BLEU cannot capture coherence effectively.

- Language models: Large neural network models that generate fluent text, but struggle with structuring coherent long-form articles. Evaluated models include Llama, GPT-4.

- Automatic evaluation: Using metrics to automatically evaluate text generation systems instead of human evaluations. PDD is compared to metrics like ROUGE, BertScore.

- Human evaluations: Having human judges evaluate and compare coherence of generated texts. Used to validate effectiveness of PDD.

In summary, the key focus is on using the proposed PDD metric to automatically evaluate discourse coherence in long-form text generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new automatic metric called Positional Discourse Divergence (PDD). What is the key intuition behind this metric and how does it capture discourse coherence better than existing metrics?

2. One of the key components of PDD is dividing the text into positional bins. What is the effect of choosing different numbers of bins on the behavior and sensitivity of PDD? Provide some examples to illustrate this.

3. The paper validates PDD on three different datasets - News Discourse, Long-form QA, and Recipe1M+. What are some key differences between the discourse structure of texts from these three domains? How does PDD account for these differences?  

4. When applying PDD, the paper utilizes discourse role classifiers to label sentences with discourse roles. What is the impact of classifier accuracy on the reliability of PDD scores? How can this be accounted for?

5. The comparison of PDD against baseline metrics reveals some interesting findings. What factors contribute to the better performance of PDD over exact match and n-gram based metrics? And what allows it to achieve comparable performance to semantic similarity metrics like BertScore?

6. One argument made in the paper is that PDD correlates better with human judgments compared to metrics like BLEU and ROUGE. Why do you think this is the case? What specific aspects of coherence are better captured by PDD?

7. The choice of bin number N allows tuning the sensitivity of PDD to local variations. What are some principles or guidelines that can be used to select an appropriate value of N for a new dataset from an unseen domain?

8. The paper focuses exclusively on sentence-level discourse structure. Do you think PDD can be extended to model coherence of discourse relations between clauses or phrases within sentences? What challenges might this present?  

9. The paper acknowledges some limitations of PDD regarding its dependence on discourse schema definitions and annotated data. How can these limitations be addressed in future work?

10. Apart from evaluating generated text, can you envision other potential use cases for PDD? For instance, could it be used to compare the discourse structure of texts written by humans vs language models?
