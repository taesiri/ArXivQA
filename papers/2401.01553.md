# [Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality in Predicting Axillary Lymph   Node Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-modal learning using both whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical data can improve diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. 
- However, clinical data is often missing during testing due to privacy concerns, limited resources, etc. This leads to performance degradation.
- Existing methods do not handle the practical situation where clinical data is partly missing during testing.

Proposed Solution:
- A bidirectional distillation (BD) framework with a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch.
- The single-modal branch learns to make predictions using only WSIs, while also using a learnable prompt to memorize missing clinical data.  
- Knowledge distillation transfers multi-modal knowledge to the single-modal branch.
- Distillation also transfers robust WSI features from the single-modal to the multi-modal branch.
- Can flexibly handle both complete and incomplete modalities during testing.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a BD framework to tackle missing clinical data and utilize complete modalities during training.
- Introduces a learnable prompt for single-modal branch to memorize missing clinical data.
- Shows distilling robust WSI features from single to multi-modal branch is beneficial.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on dataset, even with 80% missing clinical data.
- Framework is model- and task-agnostic. Could apply to other multi-modal problems.

In summary, the key innovation is a BD framework that leverages knowledge distillation to create a robust multi-modal model that can handle missing modalities during testing for diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a bidirectional distillation framework with a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch to tackle the problem of missing clinical data during testing for the prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer patients using whole slide images and clinical data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. Proposing a bidirectional distillation (BD) framework with a single-modal branch and a multi-modal branch to flexibly handle both modality complete and incomplete inputs during testing. 

2. Introducing a learnable prompt to transfer knowledge of the missing clinical modality to the single-modal branch during distillation.

3. Leveraging distillation from the single-modal branch to the multi-modal branch to extract more robust features of the whole slide images, avoiding the multi-modal branch from overfitting on complex fused features.

4. Conducting experiments that demonstrate the model's strong performance on the lymph node metastasis prediction task, achieving state-of-the-art results and maintaining high performance even with up to 80% missing clinical data.

5. Providing further analysis and experiments on handling missing modalities in both the clinical data and whole slide images, validating the efficacy of the proposed model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel bidirectional distillation framework to effectively learn from multi-modal data during training while flexibly handling missing modalities during testing for the lymph node metastasis prediction task. The key ideas include using distillation in both directions between the branches and introducing a learnable prompt to handle missing data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Missing modality - The paper focuses on dealing with missing modalities, specifically clinical data, during testing of multi-modal models.

- Whole slide images (WSI) - One of the modalities is histopathology whole slide images. 

- Clinical data - The other modality is clinical data such as age, tumor size, etc.

- Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) - The task is to predict the metastatic status of axillary lymph nodes, an important problem in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

- Multi-modal learning - The paper explores multi-modal learning frameworks, specifically with missing modalities.

- Bidirectional distillation - A key contribution is a proposed bidirectional distillation framework with a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch.

- Knowledge distillation - Distillation techniques are used to transfer knowledge between the branches.

- Learnable prompt - A learnable prompt is introduced to help deal with missing clinical data.

- Breast cancer diagnosis - The prediction task is part of diagnosis and treatment planning for breast cancer patients.

In summary, key ideas include multi-modal learning, missing modalities, distillation, prompts, and axillary lymph node metastasis prediction for breast cancer.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a bidirectional distillation (BD) framework with a single-modal branch and a multi-modal branch. What is the motivation behind this architecture? Why have separate branches instead of a single model?

2. How does the knowledge transfer work between the single-modal branch and multi-modal branch? Explain the distillation losses used in both directions and why they are necessary. 

3. The single-modal branch uses a learnable prompt to deal with missing modalities. Why is a learnable prompt used instead of just a flag or indicator variable? How is the prompt initialized and mapped to handle missing modalities?

4. The paper finds that adding clinical data can negatively impact WSI feature learning in the multi-modal branch. What analysis and experiments support this finding? How does distillation from the single-modal branch alleviate this issue?

5. How does the framework flexibly handle both partially missing and fully missing modalities during testing? What determines when each branch is used?

6. Could the proposed method work for more than 2 modalities (e.g. images, clinical data, and genetics)? Would the framework need to be modified to handle additional modalities?

7. How are the projection modules $\mathcal{M}_{mul}$, $\mathcal{M}_{sgl}$ used? What role do they play in aligning intermediate features for distillation?

8. For the ablation studies, why is distillation in both directions ($\mathcal{S}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{S}$) needed? When is each one most beneficial?

9. The paper shows the method works when WSIs are missing instead of clinical data. Does this require any architectural changes compared to missing clinical data?

10. Could the proposed bidirectional distillation framework be applied to other multimodal medical tasks beyond lymph node metastasis classification? What challenges might arise?
