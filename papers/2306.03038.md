# [HeadSculpt: Crafting 3D Head Avatars with Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03038)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How can we generate and edit high-fidelity 3D head avatars from text descriptions in a flexible and controllable manner?More specifically, the paper seeks to address two key challenges with existing text-to-3D generation methods:1) Inconsistency and geometric distortions in the generated 3D head avatars, due to the lack of 3D awareness in the underlying 2D image diffusion models. 2) Limitations in fine-grained editing of the generated avatars, such as identity loss or inadequate modifications, due to inherent bias in the diffusion models and inconsistent gradient propagation during editing.To tackle these issues, the paper proposes a new method called HeadSculpt that incorporates:- Prior-driven score distillation to impose 3D awareness into the diffusion model using facial landmarks and a learned back-view token.- Identity-aware editing score distillation (IESD) to enable controlled editing that respects both the original identity and editing instructions. The overall hypothesis is that by incorporating these techniques into a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, HeadSculpt will be able to create and edit high-fidelity, view-consistent 3D head avatars from text in a more robust and controllable way compared to prior art. The experiments aim to validate the superiority of HeadSculpt in achieving this goal.
