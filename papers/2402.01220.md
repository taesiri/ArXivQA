# [Delving into Decision-based Black-box Attacks on Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01220)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Semantic segmentation is widely used in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. However, recent work has shown that semantic segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Prior work has focused more on white-box attacks, but black-box attacks pose a more realistic threat. Specifically, decision-based black-box attacks, where the attacker only has access to the predicted labels, remain relatively unexplored for semantic segmentation. Such attacks face three key challenges: 
(1) Inconsistent optimization goal between image classification and semantic segmentation. 
(2) Perturbation interaction across pixels causing unstable optimizations.  
(3) Complex continuous parameter space hampering efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel decision-based black-box attack called Discrete Linear Attack (DLA) that addresses the above challenges. The key ideas are:

1) Use a proxy index (mean IoU) to guide the attack starting from clean images. This provides a consistent optimization goal. 

2) Introduce discrete linear noises as perturbations, which have less interaction than patch or random noises.

3) Discretize the parameter space to improve efficiency. 

The attack has two phases - perturbation exploration and calibration:

1) Perturbation exploration initializes the attack by alternatively adding horizontal and vertical discrete linear noises guided by the proxy index.

2) Perturbation calibration hierarchically flips the sign of local perturbations to further optimize the attack.

Main Contributions:

- First exploration of decision-based black-box attacks on semantic segmentation
- Identification and analysis of key challenges in such attacks  
- Proposal of DLA, a highly efficient attack using proxy index and discrete linear noises
- Extensive experiments showing DLA can reduce mIoU of PSPNet on Cityscapes from 77.83% to 2.14% in only 50 queries

The paper provides novel insights into vulnerabilities of semantic segmentation models, and DLA serves as an efficient tool to evaluate and improve robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a decision-based black-box attack called Discrete Linear Attack (DLA) to evaluate the adversarial robustness of semantic segmentation models by using discrete linear noises for efficient perturbation exploration and calibration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides the first in-depth study of decision-based attacks on semantic segmentation, analyzing the differences and challenges compared to attacking image classification. 

2) It proposes a novel decision-based attack on semantic segmentation called Discrete Linear Attack (DLA), which utilizes discrete linear noises for efficient perturbation exploration and calibration.

3) It conducts extensive experiments on 2 datasets and 5 models, demonstrating the superiority of DLA over 7 competing attacks in terms of attack performance and query efficiency. For example, on Cityscapes, DLA reduces PSPNet's mIoU from 77.83% to 2.14% within only 50 queries.

4) It reveals the vulnerability of existing semantic segmentation models to decision-based attacks, even advanced transformer-based models, which is concerning for security-sensitive applications and calls for more research into robust designs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DLA, an efficient decision-based attack to evaluate and reveal the adversarial vulnerability of semantic segmentation models. DLA outperforms prior attacks and poses a threat that motivates further research into robustness.
