# [A Machine Learning Approach Towards SKILL Code Autocompletion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01921)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel methodology for autocompleting SKILL code, a scripting language used to customize electronic design automation software, using transformer neural network models. Due to the very limited availability of open-source SKILL code data, the methodology includes fine-tuning models pre-trained on general programming language datasets using both unlabeled SKILL code files and labeled SKILL input-output pairs in a supervised manner. Experiments show that models fine-tuned in this way improve over baselines in terms of BLEU score, code quality according to a SKILL static analysis tool, and human evaluation scores. However, limitations like small dataset size, model capacity, and difficulties in evaluating synthesized code functionality mean the models are not yet capable of reliably generating complete, compilable SKILL programs. The paper discusses these limitations and suggests promising future work directions like leveraging privacy-preserving machine learning techniques to increase dataset size from proprietary sources and using SKILL's static analysis capabilities to better evaluate code generation quality. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights towards improving productivity for hardware engineers through automatic SKILL code generation.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools aim to improve hardware engineers' productivity. SKILL is a scripting language used to customize EDA software. 
- Recent advances in machine learning for automatic code generation have not yet been applied to improve productivity of SKILL developers.
- Major challenge is the very limited amount of available SKILL code data to train machine learning models.

Proposed Solution:
- Create a custom SKILL dataset by mining unlabeled data (full SKILL files) and labeled data (SKILL comment-code pairs). Apply data filtering and deduplication to improve quality.
- Fine-tune transformer-based models pre-trained on large general programming language datasets using both unlabeled and labeled SKILL data. This allows more efficient learning from the small SKILL dataset.
- Propose evaluation methodology using BLEU, SKILL lint score, and human judgement.

Key Contributions:
- First study exploring transformer-based models for SKILL code autocompletion.
- Methodology to create high-quality custom SKILL dataset.
- Data-efficient fine-tuning strategy using models pre-trained on other languages. 
- Experiments showing models fine-tuned on both unlabeled and labeled SKILL data outperform baselines.
- Analysis of limitations (small dataset, model size, evaluation) and suggestions for future work.
- Provides insights towards improving productivity of SKILL developers through machine learning code autocompletion.

In summary, the paper explores a novel application of transformer models to improve SKILL developer productivity given a major scarcity of SKILL data, through a customized data-efficient methodology. It provides a proof-of-concept along with analysis of current limitations to guide future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel methodology for training transformer models to autocomplete SKILL code using a small custom dataset, with experimental results showing promise but also limitations due to the extremely small dataset size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel, data-efficient methodology for training machine learning models to autocomplete SKILL code. This includes creating a custom SKILL dataset with both unlabeled and labeled data, and fine-tuning transformer models pre-trained on general programming language data using both types of SKILL data.

2) Conducting experiments to validate the proposed methodology, including comparing different training strategies, model types, and evaluation metrics. The results provide insights into effective techniques for learning to generate SKILL code given the very limited amount of available training data.

3) Discussing limitations of the current work and suggesting promising future research directions to address issues around dataset scaling, model size, and evaluation of synthesized SKILL code. 

In summary, while the trained models are not yet capable of reliable SKILL code autocompletion, the paper makes valuable contributions around a novel methodology tailored to the data-scarce SKILL language and an experimental analysis that provides lessons learned towards improving SKILL code generation. The limitations and future work discussion also outline important next steps for progress in this area.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel methodology for creating a high-quality custom SKILL dataset. What are the key steps taken to create this dataset and why were they important? For example, what sources were used, what pre-processing was done, etc.

2. The paper argues that using transformer models pre-trained on general programming language data is beneficial when fine-tuning on the small custom SKILL dataset. Why is this the case? What specifically about the transformer architecture and pre-training helps with this transfer learning approach?

3. What were the different training strategies explored in terms of using unlabeled data, labeled data, filtering techniques, and deduplication? Why was each of these factors varied and what insights were gained from the results?

4. The paper proposes a SKILL-specific evaluation methodology using BLEU score, SKILL lint score, and human evaluation. Why were each of these evaluation techniques chosen and what are their respective strengths and weaknesses for evaluating synthesized SKILL code?  

5. What were the quantitative results of the experiments in terms of BLEU score, change in lint IQ score, and human evaluation score? How do these results support or refute the claims made about the proposed methodology?

6. The paper argues that despite improvements compared to baselines, the overall performance indicates that reliable SKILL code generation was not achieved. What thresholds or ranges of metrics would you expect the models to achieve before considering them reliable enough for assisting SKILL developers?

7. What are some of the main limitations discussed in the paper in terms of dataset size and confidentiality, model size, and evaluation of synthesized SKILL code? How do these limitations contribute to the models not being reliable enough?

8. For each limitation discussed, the paper proposes future work to address it. What specifically is proposed to alleviate confidentiality concerns and scale up the dataset? How can model size be increased efficiently? What alternative evaluation techniques are suggested?

9. Do you think expanding the dataset or increasing model size should be prioritized first in future work? Defend your answer with reasoning based on the experiments and results sections.

10. What about the proposed methodology do you think helps advance research towards improving developer productivity in the hardware design domain? Where exactly could a reliable SKILL code generation model fit into the hardware design workflow if the limitations are indeed addressed in future work?
