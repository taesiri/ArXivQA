# [A Machine Learning Approach Towards SKILL Code Autocompletion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01921)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel methodology for autocompleting SKILL code, a scripting language used to customize electronic design automation software, using transformer neural network models. Due to the very limited availability of open-source SKILL code data, the methodology includes fine-tuning models pre-trained on general programming language datasets using both unlabeled SKILL code files and labeled SKILL input-output pairs in a supervised manner. Experiments show that models fine-tuned in this way improve over baselines in terms of BLEU score, code quality according to a SKILL static analysis tool, and human evaluation scores. However, limitations like small dataset size, model capacity, and difficulties in evaluating synthesized code functionality mean the models are not yet capable of reliably generating complete, compilable SKILL programs. The paper discusses these limitations and suggests promising future work directions like leveraging privacy-preserving machine learning techniques to increase dataset size from proprietary sources and using SKILL's static analysis capabilities to better evaluate code generation quality. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights towards improving productivity for hardware engineers through automatic SKILL code generation.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools aim to improve hardware engineers' productivity. SKILL is a scripting language used to customize EDA software. 
- Recent advances in machine learning for automatic code generation have not yet been applied to improve productivity of SKILL developers.
- Major challenge is the very limited amount of available SKILL code data to train machine learning models.

Proposed Solution:
- Create a custom SKILL dataset by mining unlabeled data (full SKILL files) and labeled data (SKILL comment-code pairs). Apply data filtering and deduplication to improve quality.
- Fine-tune transformer-based models pre-trained on large general programming language datasets using both unlabeled and labeled SKILL data. This allows more efficient learning from the small SKILL dataset.
- Propose evaluation methodology using BLEU, SKILL lint score, and human judgement.

Key Contributions:
- First study exploring transformer-based models for SKILL code autocompletion.
- Methodology to create high-quality custom SKILL dataset.
- Data-efficient fine-tuning strategy using models pre-trained on other languages. 
- Experiments showing models fine-tuned on both unlabeled and labeled SKILL data outperform baselines.
- Analysis of limitations (small dataset, model size, evaluation) and suggestions for future work.
- Provides insights towards improving productivity of SKILL developers through machine learning code autocompletion.

In summary, the paper explores a novel application of transformer models to improve SKILL developer productivity given a major scarcity of SKILL data, through a customized data-efficient methodology. It provides a proof-of-concept along with analysis of current limitations to guide future work.
