# [A Machine Learning Approach Towards SKILL Code Autocompletion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01921)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel methodology for autocompleting SKILL code, a scripting language used to customize electronic design automation software, using transformer neural network models. Due to the very limited availability of open-source SKILL code data, the methodology includes fine-tuning models pre-trained on general programming language datasets using both unlabeled SKILL code files and labeled SKILL input-output pairs in a supervised manner. Experiments show that models fine-tuned in this way improve over baselines in terms of BLEU score, code quality according to a SKILL static analysis tool, and human evaluation scores. However, limitations like small dataset size, model capacity, and difficulties in evaluating synthesized code functionality mean the models are not yet capable of reliably generating complete, compilable SKILL programs. The paper discusses these limitations and suggests promising future work directions like leveraging privacy-preserving machine learning techniques to increase dataset size from proprietary sources and using SKILL's static analysis capabilities to better evaluate code generation quality. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights towards improving productivity for hardware engineers through automatic SKILL code generation.
