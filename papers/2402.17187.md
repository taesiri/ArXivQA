# [PE-MVCNet: Multi-view and Cross-modal Fusion Network for Pulmonary   Embolism Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pulmonary embolisms (PE) are a severe medical condition that have high mortality rates if not detected early. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the primary diagnostic technique, but interpreting the many images is challenging for clinicians. 
- Recent deep learning methods for PE detection using CT images have limitations in terms of unidimensional data and incomplete multimodal fusion. Most methods do not integrate clinical information from electronic medical records (EMR), even though this information helps physicians interpret medical images.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a multi-modal fusion methodology called PE-MVCNet that integrates both CTPA imaging data and EMR data to enhance diagnosis accuracy.
- The method uses three key modules - Image-only module, EMR-only module and Cross-modal Attention Fusion (CMAF) module.

Image-only module:
- Uses a Multi-View Coupled Self-Attention block to extract spatial, channel and dimensional features from images using dual attention mechanisms. Captures global and local correlations.

EMR-only module:  
- Preprocesses EMR data and extracts features using MLP network with transformer, capturing important clinical information.

CMAF module:
- Learns alignments between image features and EMR features to fuse information from both modalities. Enhances model's ability to leverage complementary multimodal data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel integration of multi-view image features and cross-modal fusion of CT and EMR data for enhanced PE diagnosis. 
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods as well as single modality models on key metrics like AUROC, accuracy and F1 score.
- Comprehensive feature fusion enables more robust PE predictions by leveraging correlations between imaging and clinical data.

In summary, the proposed PE-MVCNet elegantly combines multi-view imaging analysis and cross-modal fusion techniques to improve pulmonary embolism detection over single-modality approaches. The multi-modal methodology better mimics physician workflows and provides a robust diagnostic support system.
