# [Object Recognition from Scientific Document based on Compartment   Refinement Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09038)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Compartment & Text Blocks Refinement (CTBR) for accurately extracting and understanding the layout and content within scientific documents. The framework defines a hierarchical structure consisting of base domains, compartments like figures or tables, and text blocks within them. It develops an encoding template to represent key features of text blocks like font, size, and density. Text blocks are manually annotated for a classification module based on an SVM classifier to categorize them into types like body text or figure components. The classification results are then utilized in an algorithm for precise segmentation of compartments and recognition of embedded objects like figures and tables. A key advantage is the ability to leverage both rule-based and machine learning techniques to process simpler and more complex text blocks respectively. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy for compartment detection using this approach. Overall, CTBR provides an effective way to parse the rich structure and content within academic papers to extract cleaner data for downstream applications.
