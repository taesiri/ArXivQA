# [CoSearchAgent: A Lightweight Collaborative Search Agent with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Designing lightweight collaborative search systems integrated within instant messaging platforms aligns better with users' habits of separately using messaging apps and search engines for collaborative search tasks. However, implementing a fully-functioning system is challenging due to the complexity of multi-user interaction scenarios. Previous studies relied on the Wizard of Oz paradigm to simulate such systems.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CoSearchAgent, a lightweight collaborative search agent powered by large language models (LLMs). It is implemented as a Slack plugin that can understand multi-party conversational contexts, ask clarifying questions when queries are ambiguous, search the web for relevant information, and respond to users with answers grounded in the search results.  

Key Capabilities:
- Comprehend context in multi-user conversations and rewrite incomplete user queries
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous query parts 
- Retrieve pertinent search results and extract query-relevant content from result pages as references
- Generate answers relying on the references to augment accuracy and reduce hallucinations

Main Contributions:
- First work to utilize LLMs for collaborative search instead of the Wizard of Oz approach
- Implementation of CoSearchAgent as an open-source and customizable Slack plugin to support collaborative search research 
- Recording of user logs like conversations, searches and clicks to enable analysis of user behavior
- Demonstration of CoSearchAgent's capabilities in understanding context, interacting with users, searching, and answering grounded in retrieval

In summary, the paper presents a novel LLM-based collaborative search agent that can participate in multi-party conversations to address users' information needs, overcoming limitations of previous Wizard of Oz approaches. The open-sourced plugin and logging functionalities make it valuable for advancing collaborative search research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CoSearchAgent, a lightweight collaborative search agent implemented as a Slack plugin that leverages large language models to understand multi-user conversations, ask clarifying questions, retrieve relevant search results, and generate answers grounded in those results to assist users collaboratively addressing their information needs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution seems to be the proposal of CoSearchAgent, which is described as:

"In this demo, we introduce a lightweight collaborative search agent, CollabSearchAgent, leveraging LLMs for interactions with multiple users to fulfill their collaborative information needs on Slack. With the capability to comprehend queries and context within a multi-user conversation and the aptitude to explore the web for pertinent information, CoSearchAgent can not only provide relevant search results but also generate accurate answers grounded on these search results to users."

So in summary, the main contribution is the design and development of CoSearchAgent, which is a collaborative search agent/system powered by large language models that can understand conversational context, retrieve relevant information, and provide answers to support collaborative search between multiple users conversing on platforms like Slack.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords associated with it are:

Collaborative Search, Large Language Models, Agents

These keywords are listed at the end of the paper's abstract:

"\keywords{Collaborative Search, Large Language Models, Agents}"

So the key terms that characterize this paper on lightweight collaborative search agents using large language models are "Collaborative Search", "Large Language Models", and "Agents".


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using large language models (LLMs) to power the CoSearchAgent. What are some of the key capabilities of LLMs that make them well-suited for a collaborative search agent? 

2. The CoSearchAgent architecture has three main components: query processing, search results presentation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Can you elaborate on the technical details and implementation of each component? What were some of the main design choices and tradeoffs?

3. The query processing module involves rewriting queries and asking clarification questions. What natural language processing and natural language understanding techniques does the system leverage to accomplish these tasks effectively? 

4. When presenting search results, the system replaces snippets with query-relevant summaries extracted from the search result pages. What is the extraction process here? How does the system identify and summarize the most relevant portions?

5. The retrieval-augmented generation module produces answers supported by citations to the extracted search result summaries. What is the formatting scheme for the generated answers? How are the citations determined and linked to the supporting evidence?

6. The system implements a two-step pipeline to extract text from HTML pages while respecting LLM length limitations. Can you walk through this pipeline and explain why it is necessary?

7. What guidance and training mechanisms, such as demonstrations, does the system provide to the LLM to improve its performance on key tasks like query rewriting and evidence-based answer generation? 

8. The system architecture in Figure 2 shows the different components and data flows. What are some ways this architecture could be extended or augmented to support additional collaborative search capabilities?

9. The paper mentions that the system records user behavior logs for analysis. What types of logs are captured and what insights do they provide into the collaborative search process?

10. How customizable and extensible is the overall CoSearchAgent framework for exploring new research directions in collaborative search? What would need to change to test different hypotheses?
