# [Fast Inference and Update of Probabilistic Density Estimation on   Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08824)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new normalizing flow-based model called FlowChain for fast and accurate probability density estimation of human trajectory prediction. The key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:- Can a normalizing flow model provide fast and accurate density estimation for trajectory prediction compared to previous methods like VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models? The hypothesis is that the analytical density computation of normalizing flows will be faster and more accurate than approximations like KDE needed by other generative models.- Can a chained/stacked normalizing flow architecture estimate spatio-temporal densities, predicting the density of positions at each future time step? The hypothesis is that the proposed chained flow architecture can capture both spatial and temporal uncertainties. - Can density estimation be rapidly updated by reusing parts of the model (the flow transformations) while adapting to new observations? The hypothesis is that reusing the flow transformations representing the motion trend can significantly speed up density updates while maintaining accuracy.So in summary, the main research questions revolve around whether normalizing flows and the proposed FlowChain architecture can achieve superior speed and accuracy for density estimation in trajectory prediction, as well as enable fast updates, compared to previous generative model-based approaches. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a new normalizing flow-based trajectory prediction model called FlowChain that achieves fast and accurate probability density estimation. The key highlights are:- FlowChain uses a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that allow analytical computation of probability densities. This is faster than generative models that need additional approximations like kernel density estimation. - FlowChain is more accurate than Gaussian mixture models due to fewer assumptions on the estimated density. It can potentially learn arbitrary complex densities.- FlowChain allows rapid update of estimated densities by adopting the newest observed position and reusing the flow transformations that represent the motion trend. This update takes less than 1ms by greatly reducing computational cost.- Experiments show FlowChain achieves state-of-the-art trajectory prediction accuracy compared to previous methods. It also demonstrates superiority in accuracy and speed of density estimation.In summary, the main contribution is a new normalizing flow architecture called FlowChain that enables fast yet accurate probabilistic density estimation and rapid updates for trajectory prediction. This is useful for safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: The paper proposes a new method for fast and accurate trajectory prediction and density estimation by using a chained model of conditional normalizing flows that can be rapidly updated with new observations by reusing the learned flow transformations and log-det-jacobians representing motion trends.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new normalizing flow-based model for human trajectory prediction called FlowChain. Here is a summary of how it compares to other recent work in trajectory prediction:- It focuses on accurately and efficiently estimating the probability density of future trajectories. Most prior work has focused only on generating plausible future trajectories, not estimating densities. Some exceptions are:- Trajectron++ (Salzmann et al. 2020): Uses a VAE to model a Gaussian mixture density over future trajectories. However, Gaussian mixtures have limited expressivity. FlowChain uses more flexible normalizing flows to estimate densities.- Flomo (Sch√∂ller et al. 2021): Also uses normalizing flows for trajectory densities. But it estimates the density of the whole future trajectory, while FlowChain estimates densities at each timestep. FlowChain can also efficiently update density estimates as new observations come in.- For trajectory generation, FlowChain achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results compared to recent models like Trajectron++, MID, and Social Implicit. So it maintains good trajectory forecasting while adding density estimation.- For density estimation, FlowChain outperforms Trajectron++ by a large margin in both speed and accuracy. It's over 300x faster than using KDE with GAN/VAE samples. The density estimates are also more accurate.- The proposed fast density update procedure is unique. It can update density estimates in <1ms by reusing computations. This allows tracking object densities in real-time as new observations come in.In summary, FlowChain pushes the state-of-the-art in trajectory forecasting by enabling fast, accurate, and updatable density estimates. The model quality and computational performance seem superior to prior techniques. The density updating capability also unlocks new real-time applications.
