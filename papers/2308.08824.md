# [Fast Inference and Update of Probabilistic Density Estimation on   Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08824)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new normalizing flow-based model called FlowChain for fast and accurate probability density estimation of human trajectory prediction. The key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:- Can a normalizing flow model provide fast and accurate density estimation for trajectory prediction compared to previous methods like VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models? The hypothesis is that the analytical density computation of normalizing flows will be faster and more accurate than approximations like KDE needed by other generative models.- Can a chained/stacked normalizing flow architecture estimate spatio-temporal densities, predicting the density of positions at each future time step? The hypothesis is that the proposed chained flow architecture can capture both spatial and temporal uncertainties. - Can density estimation be rapidly updated by reusing parts of the model (the flow transformations) while adapting to new observations? The hypothesis is that reusing the flow transformations representing the motion trend can significantly speed up density updates while maintaining accuracy.So in summary, the main research questions revolve around whether normalizing flows and the proposed FlowChain architecture can achieve superior speed and accuracy for density estimation in trajectory prediction, as well as enable fast updates, compared to previous generative model-based approaches. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a new normalizing flow-based trajectory prediction model called FlowChain that achieves fast and accurate probability density estimation. The key highlights are:- FlowChain uses a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that allow analytical computation of probability densities. This is faster than generative models that need additional approximations like kernel density estimation. - FlowChain is more accurate than Gaussian mixture models due to fewer assumptions on the estimated density. It can potentially learn arbitrary complex densities.- FlowChain allows rapid update of estimated densities by adopting the newest observed position and reusing the flow transformations that represent the motion trend. This update takes less than 1ms by greatly reducing computational cost.- Experiments show FlowChain achieves state-of-the-art trajectory prediction accuracy compared to previous methods. It also demonstrates superiority in accuracy and speed of density estimation.In summary, the main contribution is a new normalizing flow architecture called FlowChain that enables fast yet accurate probabilistic density estimation and rapid updates for trajectory prediction. This is useful for safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.
