# [PCR-99: A Practical Method for Point Cloud Registration with 99%   Outliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of point cloud registration with a large proportion of outlier correspondences. Specifically, it considers the task of estimating the relative rotation, translation (and optionally scale) between two sets of 3D points, when the correspondences contain up to 99% outliers. This is a challenging problem relevant to many applications like 3D reconstruction, object recognition and SLAM. 

Proposed Solution - PCR-99:
The paper proposes a novel method called PCR-99 that can robustly handle extreme outlier ratios. The key ideas are:

1. Score point correspondences based on pairwise scale consistency to identify probable inliers. Correspondences that have consistent scales with many others get higher scores.

2. Prioritize 3-point samples with lower sum of ranking numbers, where ranking is based on the scores. This allows sampling good correspondences early. 

3. Efficiently reject bad samples using triplet scale consistency without needing to compute their full hypotheses. This is done by precomputing and reusing log-ratio data.

4. Find the largest consensus set amongst the sampled hypotheses and recompute the final transform using the inliers.

Contributions:
The main contributions are:

- A reliable scoring method to identify probable inliers even with extreme outliers
- An effective sample selection strategy favoring good correspondences  
- Efficient outlier rejection enabling real-time performance
- State-of-the-art accuracy and robustness up to 99% outliers
- Significantly faster than prior arts for both known and unknown scale problems

The proposed PCR-99 method sets a new state-of-the-art for robust point cloud registration under extreme outlier ratios in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
