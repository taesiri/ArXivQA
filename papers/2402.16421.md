# [Outline-Guided Object Inpainting with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16421)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Obtaining pixel-level annotations for instance segmentation datasets is costly and labor-intensive. 
- Existing methods to augment segmentation datasets using generative models often fail to preserve consistency between generated images and ground truth masks.

Proposed Solution:
- Use an erosion operation on instance masks to obtain object outlines as guidance for a pre-trained diffusion inpainting model. 
- The outline provides indirect but strong guidance for the model to generate variations of objects that comply with the outlines, thereby preserving mask correspondence.
- Additionally use class name text prompts for extra guidance about object features.

Contributions:
- Show that object outlines implicitly guide diffusion models to reliably generate object variations fitting the outlines.
- Demonstrate a simple and training-free data augmentation pipeline for instance segmentation by eroding instance masks as model guidance.
- Extensive experiments on COCO and COCO-20i datasets validating outline guidance, impact of text prompts and combinations with other augmentations.
- Show performance gains when augmenting few-shot COCO-20i with generated images, especially for larger object instances.
- Achieve state-of-the-art Fr√©chet Inception Distance and CLIP score compared to other inpainting methods.

In summary, the key idea is to exploit the intrinsic capability of diffusion models to continue object outlines for data augmentation in instance segmentation by providing eroded instance masks as guidance during diffusion inpainting.
