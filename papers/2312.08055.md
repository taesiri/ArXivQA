# [Breaking the Silence: the Threats of Using LLMs in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08055)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper discusses critical threats to the validity of software engineering research involving large language models (LLMs). It focuses on three main concerns - the use of closed-source models lacking transparency, potential data leakage between an LLM's training data and research datasets, and reproducibility issues stemming from non-deterministic outputs, unpredictable model changes, and limited traceability. To address these, guidelines are proposed targeting both LLM providers regarding transparency, versioning, and archiving and SE researchers regarding assessing variability, furnishing metadata, using diverse data sources, and comparative evaluation. The guidelines are demonstrated via a test case generation example using ChatGPT on the Defects4J dataset. Variability metrics are provided, code obfuscation is shown to impact performance, and sample metadata is shared. The paper argues for an open discussion around establishing standards when using LLMs in SE research to advance the field reliably considering aspects like privacy and carbon footprint.
