# [Breaking the Silence: the Threats of Using LLMs in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08055)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper discusses critical threats to the validity of software engineering research involving large language models (LLMs). It focuses on three main concerns - the use of closed-source models lacking transparency, potential data leakage between an LLM's training data and research datasets, and reproducibility issues stemming from non-deterministic outputs, unpredictable model changes, and limited traceability. To address these, guidelines are proposed targeting both LLM providers regarding transparency, versioning, and archiving and SE researchers regarding assessing variability, furnishing metadata, using diverse data sources, and comparative evaluation. The guidelines are demonstrated via a test case generation example using ChatGPT on the Defects4J dataset. Variability metrics are provided, code obfuscation is shown to impact performance, and sample metadata is shared. The paper argues for an open discussion around establishing standards when using LLMs in SE research to advance the field reliably considering aspects like privacy and carbon footprint.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper initiates a discussion on potential threats to the validity of software engineering research involving large language models, and proposes guidelines for mitigating issues like closed-source models, data leakage, and reproducibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is initiating an open discussion on potential threats to the validity of research involving large language models (LLMs) in software engineering. Specifically, the paper:

1) Identifies and discusses three key categories of threats: using closed-source LLMs, implicit data leakage between LLM training/evaluation data, and reproducibility issues due to non-deterministic LLM outputs and lack of traceability.

2) Proposes an initial set of guidelines aimed at mitigating these threats, targeting both LLM providers and software engineering researchers. These include enhancing model transparency, using versioning information, assessing output variability, providing execution metadata, using metamorphic testing, and more. 

3) Provides a practical example applying some of the guidelines in the context of test case generation using ChatGPT on two buggy programs from Defects4J. This includes assessing output variability across prompts, providing metadata, and evaluating the LLM on metamorphically transformed code.

4) Highlights existing good practices followed by some LLM providers that align with the proposed guidelines.

So in summary, the paper aims to raise awareness of validity threats when using LLMs for software engineering research, while also initiating a community discussion around defining guidelines and best practices to help address these threats. The overall goal is to advance reliable and valid LLM-based research in the field.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes guidelines for both LLM providers and SE researchers. Which set of guidelines do you think is more critical to address first and why? 

2. One of the reproducibility guidelines is to assess output variability by conducting multiple runs. What statistical methods would you recommend to quantify output variability over multiple runs?

3. The paper suggests using code obfuscation and metamorphic testing to evaluate model robustness. What types of code transformations would be most appropriate for assessing an LLM's ability to generate test cases? 

4. The guidelines advise checking for common dependencies between projects in the training, validation and test sets. What techniques could be used to efficiently detect dependency overlaps across large codebases? 

5. The paper recommends comparative analysis using both open source and closed source models. What evaluation criteria and metrics should be used to conduct a fair comparison? 

6. How can the SE community collectively define standards and expectations for LLM research given the rapid evolution of models and techniques? What channels and formats would be most effective?

7. The guidelines propose setting a random seed to ensure deterministic outputs. However, this is not guaranteed to work. What additional technical solutions could improve reproducibility of closed-source LLMs?  

8. What data or metadata should absolutely be provided to enable reproducibility assessment by a third party? Are there any potential negative consequences of requiring too much transparency?

9. How frequently should reproducibility analysis be repeated over time to quantify output drift? What factors should influence the schedule and cadence?  

10. The paper focuses narrowly on software engineering tasks, but guidelines might be adapted to other domains. What cross-disciplinary collaboration is needed to promote responsible LLM adoption?
