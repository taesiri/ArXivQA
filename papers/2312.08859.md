# [BVI-Artefact: An Artefact Detection Benchmark Dataset for Streamed   Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08859)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents BVI-Artefact, the first comprehensive benchmark database for detecting visual artefacts commonly encountered in streamed professionally generated content (PGC) videos. It contains 480 videos derived from 60 diverse sources and encompasses ten major artefact types - five arising from capture and production, including motion blur, dark scenes, graininess, banding and aliasing; and another five from post-production and transmission such as blockiness, spatial blur, transmission errors, dropped frames, and black frames. The creation process employs selected source videos containing inherent artefacts, combined with synthesis techniques for artefacts like spatial blur using Gaussian kernels and transmission errors via data corruption. The database is uniquely designed to simulate real-world streaming by allowing multiple co-existing artefacts per video. Each video comes with sequence and frame-level binary labels denoting the presence/absence of individual artefacts, confirmed through manual inspection. Results show that detecting artefacts in such challenging mixed scenarios remains an open problem. By providing the first realistic benchmark, this work facilitates further research towards more robust PGC artefact detection methods for ensuring optimal streaming quality of experience.
