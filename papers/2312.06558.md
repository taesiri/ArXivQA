## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper experimentally investigates deep reservoir computing (DRC) architectures for speech recognition using an optoelectronic setup. DRC stacks multiple reservoir layers to enhance computing performance compared to standard "shallow" reservoir computing. The authors test three architectures: a shallow reservoir, a DRC with random interlayer connections, and a DRC with evolutionary algorithm-optimized interlayer connections. Experiments are conducted on spoken digit recognition and Japanese vowel classification tasks. Results demonstrate that the DRC architectures, especially the optimized version, outperform the shallow reservoir in terms of accuracy. Additional findings show improved noise robustness with DRC and feasibility of real-time speech classification. The simplified design approach of asynchronously linking reservoir delay and clock cycle is also validated. By demonstrating high-performance DRC for speech recognition using time-multiplexed optoelectronic hardware, this work helps enable the development of fast, energy-efficient photonic neuromorphic systems for real-world applications. Further research directions are suggested, including reservoir-specific hyperparameter tuning, more efficient interlayer optimization algorithms, and testing on complex time-series.
