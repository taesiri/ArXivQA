# [QuantAgent: Seeking Holy Grail in Trading by Self-Improving Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03755)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Applying autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) to specialized domains like quantitative finance poses challenges. A key issue is building and integrating a domain-specific knowledge base to enable the agent to tackle complex problems like an expert.  
- Manually creating such knowledge bases is expensive and may be infeasible for certain domains. Existing methods also lack a systematic framework to assess the impact of knowledge integration.

Method:
- Proposes a two-layer loop system for agents to autonomously develop domain knowledge:
   - Inner loop: Agent iteratively refines its responses by interacting with a simulated environment defined by an internal knowledge base.  
   - Outer loop: Agent's responses are evaluated against the real-world, generating feedback to enrich the internal knowledge base.
- Provides a theoretical analysis proving the efficiency of both loops in converging towards an optimal solution, using techniques from reinforcement learning.

Contributions:  
- Presents a principled framework allowing autonomous development of domain-specific knowledge bases for agents with minimal human intervention.
- Framework is provably efficient under certain assumptions and encapsulates existing self-improving agent methods.
- Demonstrates an instantiation called QuantAgent which mines financial signals by iteratively generating and evaluating trading ideas and signal implementations.
- Empirical results validate QuantAgent's ability for self-improvement, successfully uncovering viable financial signals and improving accuracy of financial forecasts.

The paper makes key contributions in formalizing a systematic approach for knowledge accumulation in autonomous agents applied to specialized domains, with both theoretical and empirical backing.
