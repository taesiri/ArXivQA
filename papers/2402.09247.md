# [Momentum Approximation in Asynchronous Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Asynchronous federated learning (AsyncFL) protocols like FedBuff have been shown to improve scalability of federated learning with many clients. However, naively applying momentum methods, which achieve the best model quality in synchronous federated learning, leads to slower convergence and worse model performance in AsyncFL. The reason is that asynchrony introduces implicit bias to momentum updates by weighting more towards stale gradients, removing the intended momentum effect. It remains an open question on how to effectively combine asynchrony and momentum for simultaneous benefits.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new algorithm called "momentum approximation" to address this problem. The key idea is to solve a least squares problem at each iteration to find the optimal coefficients to weight historical model updates such that the weighted updates best approximate the desired momentum updates as in synchronous setting. This retains the acceleration benefits from momentum. The algorithm only requires communicating an extra iteration number in addition to model updates and storing historical updates at server.

Key Contributions:
- Identify fundamental issue of implicit momentum bias caused by staleness in AsyncFL, which diminishes benefits of momentum
- Propose momentum approximation to minimize the bias and integrate asynchrony with momentum effectively 
- Achieve 1.15-4x speedup in convergence compared to AsyncFL optimizers with tuned momentum on StackOverflow and FLAIR datasets
- Compatible with secure aggregation, differential privacy with minor cost
- Resolve need to extensively tune momentum parameter on different tasks under asynchrony

In summary, the paper proposes an elegant algorithm called momentum approximation to enable combining asynchrony and momentum in federated learning, achieving faster convergence and better model quality simultaneously. The algorithm is easy to integrate in existing systems with differential privacy.
