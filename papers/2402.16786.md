# [Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations   for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current approaches for evaluating values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on constrained, multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. These do not resemble how real users interact with LLMs.
- There is a discrepancy between the real-world concerns motivating these evaluations (e.g. biased LLMs influencing society) and their artificial, survey-based nature. 

Methodology: 
- The paper investigates this issue by using the Political Compass Test (PCT) as a case study. The PCT is relevant and typical of current LLM evaluations.  
- Through a series of experiments, the authors demonstrate instabilities when constraints are removed or varied (e.g. forcing models to choose an answer) and when prompts are minimally paraphrased.
- Comparisons are also made between constrained, multiple-choice settings and more realistic, open-ended settings.  

Key Findings:
- Models often refuse to choose an answer when not forced, needing additional prompts to comply with multiple-choice format.
- How models are forced to choose (strength of prompting) substantially impacts responses.  
- Even minimal paraphrasing of prompts leads models to give different answers.
- There are further discrepancies between multiple-choice and open-ended responses.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic analysis showing clear instabilities in current approaches, limiting their informativeness regarding model values/opinions.
- Argument for using evaluations matching likely user behaviors for specific applications, with extensive robustness testing.  
- Recommendation to make local rather than broad claims about values/opinions in LLMs based on evaluations.
- Highlighting the need for more meaningful approaches than current constrained paradigm.
