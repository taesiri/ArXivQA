# [Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations   for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current approaches for evaluating values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on constrained, multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. These do not resemble how real users interact with LLMs.
- There is a discrepancy between the real-world concerns motivating these evaluations (e.g. biased LLMs influencing society) and their artificial, survey-based nature. 

Methodology: 
- The paper investigates this issue by using the Political Compass Test (PCT) as a case study. The PCT is relevant and typical of current LLM evaluations.  
- Through a series of experiments, the authors demonstrate instabilities when constraints are removed or varied (e.g. forcing models to choose an answer) and when prompts are minimally paraphrased.
- Comparisons are also made between constrained, multiple-choice settings and more realistic, open-ended settings.  

Key Findings:
- Models often refuse to choose an answer when not forced, needing additional prompts to comply with multiple-choice format.
- How models are forced to choose (strength of prompting) substantially impacts responses.  
- Even minimal paraphrasing of prompts leads models to give different answers.
- There are further discrepancies between multiple-choice and open-ended responses.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic analysis showing clear instabilities in current approaches, limiting their informativeness regarding model values/opinions.
- Argument for using evaluations matching likely user behaviors for specific applications, with extensive robustness testing.  
- Recommendation to make local rather than broad claims about values/opinions in LLMs based on evaluations.
- Highlighting the need for more meaningful approaches than current constrained paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper challenges constrained evaluations of values and opinions in large language models using the Political Compass Test as a case study, finding that results vary substantially depending on experimental setup and recommending more realistic application-grounded evaluations with extensive robustness testing to make local rather than global claims.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is challenging the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) by showing that constrained evaluations produce very different results than more realistic unconstrained evaluations. Specifically, the authors:

1) Systematically review prior work using the Political Compass Test (PCT) to evaluate LLMs and find that most works force models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. 

2) Demonstrate that models give different answers when not forced to choose, and that answers further change depending on how models are forced.

3) Show that multiple-choice answers lack robustness to minimal prompt paraphrasing.  

4) Find that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended setting compared to the constrained multiple-choice format.

Based on these findings, the authors recommend using evaluations that match likely user behaviors in specific applications, accompanied by extensive robustness testing, in order to make local rather than broad claims about values and opinions manifested in LLMs.

The paper focuses on evaluating values and opinions in large language models using the Political Compass Test as a case study. It examines issues with current constrained evaluation approaches that use multiple-choice formats, and compares results to more unconstrained, open-ended evaluations. Key findings relate to instabilities across different evaluation settings, leading to recommendations around matching likely real-world usage, extensive robustness testing, and making local rather than global claims about models based on evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that current evaluation practices for values and opinions in LLMs resemble "spinning arrows". How could alternative evaluation designs avoid this issue more effectively? What trade-offs might they entail?  

2. The authors advocate for making "local rather than global" claims about LLM values based on evaluations. What are some concrete ways researchers could limit the scope of claims appropriately without falling into the trap of overgeneralization?

3. How might the relative instability of LLM values observed across different evaluations impact arguments around the "alignment" of LLMs via techniques like reinforcement learning? Could alignment still be meaningful despite this?

4. The unconstrained, open-ended evaluation proposed leads to more “disagreement” from models on PCT propositions. Is this likely an artifact of the chosen topic and dataset, or evidence of an inherent bias?

5. The authors use minimal prompt paraphrases for testing robustness. What other semantic/syntactic perturbations could additionally stress test for stability of expressed values and opinions?  

6. For downstream applications, under what conditions should we expect expressed model values to remain stable or vary? How could researchers systematically characterize factors affecting stability?

7. The authors argue evaluations should match likely real-world model usage. How precisely could researchers characterize distribution of "likely" usage to appropriately sample evaluation settings?

8. The agreement classifier for labeling open-ended responses showed high accuracy, but could still have systematic blindspots. How could the limitations of automatic evaluation be addressed?

9. The authors identify conceptual issues around attributing singular “values and opinions” to LLMs. How might alternative theoretical framings better capture the fluid, complex behaviors observed? 

10. The findings caution against overgeneralizing from any specific evaluation to make global claims about models. In that context, what confidence thresholds seem appropriate for making "local" claims?
