# LLaVAR: Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning for Text-Rich Image
  Understanding

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, it seems this paper focuses on enhancing visual instruction tuning models to better understand textual details in images. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- How can visual instruction tuning models like LLaVA be improved to better comprehend and reason about text in images? - Will augmenting the training data with noisy OCR examples and high-quality instruction-following conversations generated from text-only GPT-4 enhance the model's capabilities on text-rich images?- Can these enhancements boost performance on text-based VQA datasets and instruction following evaluations while maintaining or improving skills on natural images?- What resolutions and model architectures work best for encoding fine textual details?The authors collect over 400K noisy OCR examples and 16K high-quality conversations to augment LLaVA's training. They show their LLaVAR model substantially outperforms LLaVA and other baselines on text-based VQA, especially at higher resolutions like 336x336. The instruction following evaluations also demonstrate improved conversational, reasoning, and text reading abilities. Overall, the core hypothesis seems to be that augmenting visual instruction tuning with text-focused data can enhance understanding and reasoning about textual details in images.
