# [Evaluation of Semantic Search and its Role in   Retrieved-Augmented-Generation (RAG) for Arabic Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Semantic search goes beyond keyword matching to understand meaning and relationships between words, improving search quality. It has many applications like Web search, question answering, and personalized content recommendation. But semantic search is still an unsolved challenge especially for a complex language like Arabic due to its morphology, dialects, and lack of datasets.

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval and text generation for contextually relevant responses to queries. Integrating semantic search can significantly improve RAG by enhancing retrieval accuracy for complex or contextual queries. But Arabic RAG lags behind due to language challenges and limited research. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a benchmark for evaluating semantic search on Arabic and studies its impact on Arabic RAG for a question answering use case. 

- Various semantic search encoders are evaluated using a dataset of customer support summaries and associated queries generated by GPT-4. Metrics like nDCG, MRR and mAP quantify ranking effectiveness.

- A RAG pipeline is implemented to test semantic search integration. FAQ variations are generated by GPT-4. Retrieved docs are used by GPT-3.5 to generate answers. GPT-4 evaluates answer quality.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive methodology to evaluate Arabic semantic search using robust metrics and dataset. Encoder #3 (paraphrase-mpnet) performs best.

- Analysis shows integrating semantic search boosts RAG answer generation accuracy by 57-63\% using GPT-3.5, establishing clear viability.

- Study provides framework to advance Arabic semantic search and RAG capabilities to match other languages. Overall work can enable better search and question answering for Arabic users.
