# [Implicit Affordance Acquisition via Causal Action-Effect Modeling in the   Video Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Affordances refer to the potential actions that objects offer, e.g. a chair affords sitting. Learning affordances is challenging due to "multiplicity" - different objects can afford the same action and vice versa.
- Two key principles that help deal with multiplicity are "behavior equivalence" (different actions can produce the same effect on an object) and "entity equivalence" (same action on different objects can produce the same effect).
- Existing supervised methods have limited ability to generalize affordance knowledge to novel objects/scenarios. 

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage large-scale self-supervised pretraining on instructional videos to implicitly acquire affordance knowledge, specifically the two equivalence principles.
- Create a new clip-subtitle dataset called Causal Action-Effect (CAE) from HowTo100M instructional videos.
- Propose two novel pretraining tasks:
    - Masked Action Modeling (MAM): Predict masked action words based on visual effects and context. Helps learn behavior equivalence.
    - Masked Effect Modeling (MEM): Predict masked visual effects given context and actions. Helps learn entity equivalence.
- Also explore joint training on both tasks (Multi-CAE).

Contributions:
- Created the new CAE dataset with 4.1M clip-subtitle pairs for modeling action-effect relationships.
- Designed MAM and MEM, two novel self-supervised pretraining tasks to implicitly learn affordance properties.
- Show models trained on MAM and MEM can adequately acquire the two equivalence principles.
- Demonstrate joint training is beneficial - Multi-CAE outperforms linguistic models on a physical reasoning probing task, indicating improved affordance knowledge.

In summary, the paper explores a video-grounded approach to implicitly learn affordance knowledge at scale through causal action-effect modeling and makes both methodological and empirical contributions towards this goal.
