# [Training Language Models to Generate Text with Citations via   Fine-grained Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT often generate incorrect or unverifiable content, hurting user trust. 
- Retrieval augmented generation methods retrieve knowledge to ground the LLM's responses, but have no guarantee that the knowledge is relevant or that the LM is consistent with it.
- Existing work prompting LLMs to generate citations faces challenges: expensive labeled data, and a complex goal needing fine-grained assessment of citation quality and response correctness.

Method: 
- Use fine-grained reward functions to measure citation quality (recall and precision) and response correctness at a sentence level granularity.
- Train LLaMA-2-7B with reinforcement learning and rejection sampling using these rewards to optimize different aspects of quality.
- Initialize with distillation on weak supervision from ChatGPT before fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- First work proposing to train LLMs with fine-grained rewards for attributable text generation.
- Show training with fine-grained rewards is much more effective than holistic rewards for optimizing quality.
- Demonstrate combining rejection sampling and reinforcement learning leads to best performance, even surpassing ChatGPT.
- Analyze the effect of different reward models and the generalizability to unseen datasets.
- Provide detailed analysis of common citation errors and limitations of the current approach.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in effectively training LLMs to generate high-quality attributable text using fine-grained rewards. The analysis also sheds light on further improving the models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach language models to generate highly supportive and relevant citations in their text while ensuring the correctness of their responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach language models (LLMs) to generate highly supportive and relevant citations in their text, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. Specifically:

- They propose to use fine-grained automatic evaluation functions from prior work as localized, specialized reward signals to train LLMs with reinforcement learning and rejection sampling. This is shown to be much more effective than using holistic rewards.

- They demonstrate that combining rejection sampling and reinforcement learning leads to the best model performance, significantly surpassing ChatGPT on attributable text generation based on evaluations on the ALCE benchmark. 

- They also show the generalizability of their training framework to unseen datasets like EXPERTQA, indicating the robustness and transferability of the model's capabilities for attributable generation when trained with fine-grained rewards.

In summary, the key contribution is using fine-grained rewards to successfully train LLMs for improved performance on attributable text generation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Attributable text generation - Generating text responses that contain in-text citations to provide evidence and improve verifiability. A key task the paper focuses on.

- Fine-grained rewards - Specialized reward signals provided at a localized, sentence level to optimize different aspects of response quality, including information correctness, citation recall, and citation precision. A core technique proposed in the paper. 

- Rejection sampling (RS) - A decoding strategy that generates multiple candidate responses and selects the best one to use as a training signal. One of the training algorithms adapted by the authors.

- Reinforcement learning (RL) - Training paradigm that optimizes a model by providing rewards for actions. Also adapted using fine-grained rewards. 

- In-text citations - Source references inserted within generated text to attribute factual claims to external evidence documents. Enables fact-checking.

- Attribution/Attributability - The ability of a model to provide evidence and enable verification of its responses, improved via fine-grained training in this work.

- Long-form question answering - Answering complex questions that require synthesizing information from multiple documents.

The key focus of the paper is on improving attribution and verifiability of long-form QA by training models to properly cite evidence using fine-grained rewards.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using fine-grained rewards for training language models on attributable text generation. What are some potential challenges or limitations of defining and implementing good fine-grained reward functions? How might the authors address these?

2. The fine-grained rewards in this paper focus on correctness, citation recall, and citation precision. What other potential fine-grained rewards could be useful for improving additional aspects of attributable text generation?

3. This paper compares training with fine-grained vs holistic rewards. What hypotheses might explain why fine-grained rewards are more effective? How could this be tested experimentally?  

4. The authors find that rejection sampling is generally more effective for training than reinforcement learning. What factors might contribute to this difference in performance? How could reinforcement learning be improved?

5. This method requires an initial distillation step using ChatGPT demonstrations. How critical is this step? Could the method work without it, such as by bootstrapping with weaker supervision? 

6. The paper focuses on question answering datasets. How well might this method transfer to other text generation tasks that require citations or attribution, such as summarization or translation? What modifications might be needed?

7. The authors use specific formulae to combine multiple fine-grained reward signals during training. What impact could different reward combination strategies have? Is there an optimal way to balance and prioritize different fine-grained rewards?

8. How robust is this method to errors or limitations of the NLI models used to compute some of the fine-grained rewards? Could improvements to the NLI models lead to better overall performance? 

9. For the ablation studies, was there any correlation observed between optimizing for answer correctness vs optimizing for citation quality rewards? What tradeoffs exist here?

10. The paper demonstrates outperforming ChatGPT on attributable text generation after fine-tuning. Could this method produce even stronger performance if applied to an underlying model larger than LLaMA-2-7B? What results might be possible?
