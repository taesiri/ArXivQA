# [Model-Predictive Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Search and   Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05944)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for search and coverage missions using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The goal is to plan optimal trajectories that maximize the coverage of a utility map describing the priority of different regions, while satisfying dynamic constraints on the UAV. The utility map is represented as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Planning trajectories for this problem is challenging due to the complexity of the objective function and constraints.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a model predictive control (MPC) based algorithm to generate smooth and efficient trajectories. The key idea is to penalize intersections between the visibility circles of the UAV along its trajectory using an exponential penalty function. This promotes exploration by preventing the UAV from revisiting covered areas. The MPC formulation uses a prediction horizon and approximates the non-convex objective function using a relaxed formulation. Computational complexity is analyzed in terms of the number of terms in the objective function. The algorithm is implemented on a quadrotor UAV using a dual-layer control architecture.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the search and coverage problem based on a GMM utility map
- MPC-based algorithm using visibility circle intersections penalty to enable efficient exploration 
- Relaxed formulation to handle non-convex objective function
- Dual-layer control architecture implementation on quadrotor UAV
- Simulation case studies demonstrating performance in MATLAB 
- Experimental validation in Gazebo simulator and outdoor flight tests

The proposed method is shown to generate smooth trajectories that explore the utility map efficiently compared to benchmark methods. Future work includes extensions for time-varying maps and obstacle avoidance.
