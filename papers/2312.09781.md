# [GSQA: An End-to-End Model for Generative Spoken Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing spoken question answering (SQA) models rely on a cascaded pipeline of ASR + text QA + TTS. This suffers from error propagation and is limited to extractive QA where answers are spans in the passages. 
- Recently proposed end-to-end models like DUAL solve the error propagation issue but are still limited to extractive QA.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce GSQA, the first end-to-end textless generative SQA model that can handle both extractive and abstractive QA.
- Uses HuBERT speech encodings and sequence-to-sequence model to generate answers in discrete units. 
- Initialize with a textual QA model (LongT5 fine-tuned on QA datasets) to transfer strong language understanding capabilities.
- Fine-tune on extractive SQA dataset (NMSQA) to adapt to speech.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end textless SQA model capable of both extractive and abstractive QA
- Method to transfer capabilities from textual QA to improve spoken QA performance
- Outperforms previous extractive SQA model DUAL on extractive datasets
- Competitive performance to cascade model on zero-shot spoken abstractive QA without seeing any abstractive SQA data

In summary, the paper introduces an end-to-end generative SQA model GSQA that can handle both extractive and abstractive QA by transferring knowledge from textual QA models and outperforms previous extractive-only SQA models.
