# [RoleInteract: Evaluating the Social Interaction of Role-Playing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work on evaluating role-playing agents has focused mainly on enhancing conversational capability, role knowledge, and stylistic attributes. However, there has been a gap in assessing the social intelligence of these agents.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RoleInteract, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels.

- The benchmark covers 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn utterances across a wide range of dimensions:
    - Individual level: Self-awareness, emotional perception, conversation memory
    - Group level: Social preference towards group dynamics

- Comprehensive human verification and validation ensure difficulty and validity of questions.

Main Contributions:

- First benchmark to assess social abilities of role-playing agents, encompassing both individual and group levels

- Careful dataset construction from diverse sources, ensuring diversity of roles and conversational scenarios

- Rigorous verification methodology involving multiple manual checks, annotations and refinements

- Analysis of over 10 mainstream open-source and commercial LLMs, providing insights into current capabilities and limitations:
    - Models tend to perform well at individual level but deficient at group level 
    - Performance at simple group dynamics doesn't imply proficiency at complex dynamics
    - Individuals susceptible to "preference drift" under influence of varying group polarities

- Highlighted gaps such as long-term memory and complex group interactions to inspire future research
