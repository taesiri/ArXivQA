# [Tuning the activation function to optimize the forecast horizon of a   reservoir computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates how the choice of activation function impacts the performance of reservoir computers (RCs) for chaotic time series prediction. Specifically, it studies how different activation functions affect the forecast horizon (FH) - the length of time the RC can accurately predict the future evolution of a chaotic system. 

Approach: 
The authors compare the FH obtained using 16 different monotonic and non-monotonic activation functions on the benchmark Lorenz chaotic system. They also continuously tune two activation functions (swish and shifted tanh) by modifying their parameters to understand how FH changes. Additionally, they explore how FH correlates with two proposed metrics - the weighted curvature and average state entropy of the activation function.

Key Findings:
- FH varies dramatically (differs by an order of magnitude) across different activation functions, highlighting sensitivity of RC performance to this choice.
- Non-monotonic activation functions generally result in higher FH than monotonic ones.  
- Modifying activation function parameters can significantly boost FH for fixed other hyperparameters.
- FH exhibits a positive correlation with the weighted curvature of the activation function. Very low curvatures degrade performance.  
- FH is maximized at an intermediate average state entropy, not the maximum entropy.

Main Contributions:
- First detailed and systematic study showing extent of FH variability across different activation functions in RCs.
- Demonstration that tuning the activation function alone can give order of magnitude improvements in FH.
- Exploration of weighted curvature and entropy as predictor metrics of activation function performance.
- Results motivate more emphasis on optimizing activation functions in hyperparameter tuning of RCs.

The paper clearly establishes the significant impact activation function choice has on performance of reservoir computers through detailed experiments and analysis.
