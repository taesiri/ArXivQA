# [Visual Correspondence Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09711)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:

1) Can we develop a neural network architecture that is able to learn to hallucinate/predict visual correspondences between images, even for regions that are occluded or outside the field of view? 

2) Is the ability to hallucinate correspondences beneficial for improving the robustness of absolute camera pose estimation?

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- They propose and analyze the novel problem of learning to hallucinate correspondences, distinguishing between "identifying", "inpainting", and "outpainting" tasks. 

- They introduce NeurHal, a network architecture that takes a pair of images and detected keypoints, and outputs probability distributions over possible correspondent locations. The network is trained to identify, inpaint, and outpaint correspondences in a unified manner.

- They demonstrate NeurHal's ability to hallucinate correspondences on unseen indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (MegaDepth) scenes.

- They show that NeurHal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on absolute camera pose estimation, especially in low-overlap cases where outpainting is critical.

So in summary, the main hypotheses are around the feasibility and benefits of correspondence hallucination, which the authors attempt to validate through the proposed NeurHal network and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing the novel task of learning to hallucinate (predict/inpaint/outpaint) visual correspondences between partially overlapping images, including when the correspondent is occluded or outside the field of view. This is in contrast to traditional methods that can only identify correspondences in covisible regions.

- Analyzing the specific challenges of this correspondence hallucination task and proposing appropriate loss functions and network architectures to handle identification, inpainting, and outpainting in a unified manner.

- Demonstrating through experiments that their proposed NeurHal network can successfully hallucinate correspondences on unseen indoor and outdoor image pairs.

- Showing that incorporating correspondence hallucination, especially outpainting, significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of absolute camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods, particularly for image pairs with low overlap.

So in summary, the main novelty seems to be introducing and tackling the new problem of correspondence hallucination, and showing its benefits for robust pose estimation. The proposed NeurHal network architecture and training framework to handle hallucination in a unified manner is also a key contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neural network method for establishing visual correspondences between two partially overlapping images, that can hallucinate the location of occluded or out-of-view correspondences through implicit geometric reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visual correspondence hallucination:

- This paper presents one of the first attempts at learning to hallucinate visual correspondences. Most prior work has focused on identifying correspondences in covisible regions using local feature descriptors and matchers. This paper proposes an approach to predict correspondences in non-covisible regions where they cannot be directly identified. 

- The idea of hallucinating visual content has been explored before in contexts like novel view synthesis or relative pose estimation with limited overlap, but not specifically for correspondences. This paper demonstrates correspondence hallucination on its own is a useful capability.

- The proposed NeurHal network architecture is novel in using a non-siamese, cross-attention-based design to allow communication between source and target features and enable hallucination. This differentiates it from prior learning-based feature matching methods based on siamese networks.

- The use of the Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) as a loss function is an elegant way to unify the identifying, inpainting and outpainting tasks without needing explicit labels. This simplifies the problem formulation.

- Experiments demonstrate NeurHal can hallucinate correspondences for indoor and outdoor scenes it wasn't trained on. Generalization ability is much better than local feature matchers constrained to covisible regions.

- For pose estimation, NeurHal significantly outperforms feature matching baselines in low overlap settings where hallucination is needed. In high overlap settings, NeurHal is comparable but not better.

Overall, this paper presents a novel task formulation and model design for correspondence hallucination. It demonstrates promising generalization ability not achieved by prior feature matching techniques. The application to robust pose estimation also highlights the practical utility of this capability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving the accuracy of the hallucinated correspondences. The authors note that their method produces relatively low-resolution correspondence maps, which limits the accuracy of the predicted correspondences. They suggest exploring architectures and training techniques to produce higher-resolution, more precise correspondence maps.

- Generalizing to more complex scenes. The experiments in the paper focus on indoor and outdoor scenes with fairly straightforward geometry. The authors suggest testing the approach on more complex environments with irregular geometries, repetitive structures, transparent/reflective surfaces, etc.

- Integrating correspondence hallucination into full 3D reconstruction pipelines like Structure-from-Motion (SfM). The authors propose that correspondence hallucination could make SfM more robust in cases with few input images, by allowing estimation of geometric relationships between images even when keypoints are not co-visible.

- Exploring the use of correspondence hallucination for other applications beyond pose estimation, such as novel view synthesis, image editing/manipulation, etc. The ability to hallucinate plausible correspondences between images with limited overlap could be useful for a variety of vision and graphics tasks.

- Investigating network architectures and training techniques to allow accurate hallucination over larger spatial ranges. The current method is limited to a fixed range beyond the image borders. Removing this constraint could expand the applicability.

- Combining correspondence hallucination with more explicit geometric reasoning within the network, to improve generalization. The current approach relies primarily on visual pattern recognition. Adding explicit modelling of scene geometry could make the hallucination more robust.

So in summary, the main directions are: improving accuracy, generalizing to more complex scenes, integrating into 3D pipelines like SfM, exploring new applications, increasing the spatial range, and combining with more structured geometric reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neural network approach called NeurHal for establishing correspondences between two partially overlapping images. Given a pair of source and target images and a set of keypoints in the source image, NeurHal outputs for each keypoint a probability distribution over its correspondent's location in the target image. This allows NeurHal to predict correspondences even when they are occluded or outside the field of view in the target image, which the authors refer to as "hallucinating" correspondences. The authors show that NeurHal is able to hallucinate correspondences on novel scenes not seen during training. They also demonstrate that NeurHal's ability to hallucinate correspondences makes it significantly more robust for absolute camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods, especially for image pairs with low overlap. The main novelty is the idea of learning to hallucinate correspondences, and the design of a network architecture and loss function that enables this.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neural network method called NeurHal for establishing visual correspondences between two partially overlapping images. The key idea is to train a network to output probability distributions over the location of correspondences, even when the correspondence is occluded or outside the field of view in the target image. This allows the network to "hallucinate" or predict the location of correspondences that are not directly visible. 

The authors demonstrate that NeurHal is able to successfully hallucinate correspondences on image pairs from indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (MegaDepth) datasets containing scenes not seen during training. They also show that NeurHal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods for the task of absolute camera pose estimation, especially in cases where the two images have low overlap. The ability to hallucinate occluded and out-of-view correspondences makes NeurHal much more robust for pose estimation than methods relying solely on feature matching. Overall, the paper presents a novel neural approach to establishing correspondences between images with limited overlap, with very promising results on correspondence hallucination and pose estimation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a neural network called NeurHal that takes as input a pair of partially overlapping source and target images along with a set of keypoints detected in the source image. NeurHal outputs for each keypoint a probability distribution (correspondence map) over its correspondent's location in the target image, regardless of whether the correspondent is visible, occluded, or outside the field of view. This allows NeurHal to identify visible correspondents as well as hallucinate/predict correspondences when the correspondent is not visible (either occluded or outside the field of view). NeurHal uses a siamese CNN backbone to extract dense descriptors from the two input images, which are then fed to a cross-attention module to allow communication between descriptors. The correspondence maps are computed by filtering the target dense descriptors using the interpolated source descriptors. NeurHal is trained end-to-end using the Neural Reprojection Error as the loss function. Experiments show NeurHal can successfully hallucinate correspondences on novel indoor and outdoor scenes. When applied to camera pose estimation, NeurHal significantly outperforms previous methods, especially in cases of low image overlap where hallucination becomes important.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is how to establish correspondences between two partially overlapping images when the corresponding point in one image may be occluded or outside the field of view. 

The key questions they seem to be trying to answer are:

1) Can we design a neural network architecture that is able to "hallucinate" or predict the locations of corresponding points between two images, even when the point is occluded or outside the field of view in one of the images? 

2) Is being able to hallucinate correspondences in this way beneficial for tasks like absolute camera pose estimation that rely on matching points between images?

To address these questions, the authors propose a network called NeurHal that takes as input two partially overlapping images along with a set of keypoints in one image, and outputs a probability distribution over where each keypoint's corresponding point is located in the other image. The network is trained to predict these probability distributions for corresponding points whether they are visible, occluded, or outside the field of view in the second image.

The authors demonstrate experimentally that NeurHal is able to hallucinate correspondences for images from new scenes not seen during training. They also show that incorporating the ability to hallucinate correspondences improves the robustness of camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods, especially for image pairs with low overlap where many points are occluded or outside the field of view.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing an approach to learn to hallucinate or predict correspondences in non-visible regions, and showing that this ability improves performance on downstream tasks relying on image matching like pose estimation.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper presents Visual Correspondence Hallucination (NeurHal), a neural network approach for establishing correspondences between two partially overlapping images. Given a pair of source and target images and a set of keypoints in the source image, NeurHal outputs a probability distribution over the location of each keypoint's correspondent in the target image. The key novelty is that NeurHal can not only identify visible correspondents, but also hallucinate probable locations for occluded or out-of-view correspondents. The authors provide an analysis of the identifying, inpainting, and outpainting tasks involved, and design NeurHal with a non-siamese architecture and Neural Reprojection Error loss to handle them in a unified manner. Experiments demonstrate NeurHal's ability to hallucinate reasonable correspondences on novel indoor and outdoor scenes. When applied to absolute camera pose estimation, incorporating hallucinated correspondences significantly improves NeurHal's robustness to low overlap image pairs compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods like SuperGlue and LoFTR. The results affirm the value of correspondence hallucination, and point to directions like integrating it into Structure-from-Motion pipelines.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called NeurHal for visual correspondence hallucination. Given a pair of partially overlapping source and target images and a set of keypoints in the source image, NeurHal outputs a probability distribution over the location of each keypoint's correspondent in the target image. It is trained to identify correspondences when they are visible, and hallucinate (predict) correspondences when they are occluded or outside the field of view. The authors propose an analysis of this novel task which guides the design of the loss function and network architecture. The network takes a non-siamese transformer-based approach to link information between the two images in order to hallucinate correspondences. Experiments demonstrate NeurHal's ability to hallucinate on unseen image pairs from ScanNet and MegaDepth. When applied to camera pose estimation, NeurHal significantly outperforms feature matching methods, especially in cases of low overlap where correspondences must be hallucinated. This shows the usefulness of correspondence hallucination for obtaining robust pose estimates.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the visual correspondence hallucination method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that learning to hallucinate correspondences is a "virgin territory". Why do you think correspondence hallucination has not been explored before in computer vision? What are the key challenges in designing a method to hallucinate correspondences?

2. The loss function used in this work is based on the Neural Reprojection Error (NRE). How does the NRE provide a unified framework for learning to identify, inpaint and outpaint correspondences? What are the advantages of using the NRE over a simple L2 loss between predicted and ground truth correspondences?

3. The network architecture uses a cross-attention mechanism between source and target descriptors. How does this allow the network to communicate and adapt the descriptors for hallucination? Why is a siamese architecture not suitable for this task?

4. The paper demonstrates correspondence hallucination on both indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (MegaDepth) datasets. What are the key differences in training the network and evaluation protocol between these two settings? How does the network generalize well to new scenes?

5. For the application to camera pose estimation, the paper combines the proposed method with the pose estimator from NeuralReprojection. Why is this combination important? How do traditional pose estimators like LO-RANSAC fail when hallucination is needed?

6. One limitation mentioned is that the network produces low-resolution correspondence maps. How could the architecture be modified to output higher resolution maps? What are the memory and computational bottlenecks? 

7. The quantitative evaluation uses metrics like NRE at ground truth locations and distance between argmax and ground truth. What are the pros and cons of these metrics? Can you suggest better evaluation protocols to measure hallucination performance?

8. The paper demonstrates results on indoor (ScanNet, NYU) and outdoor (MegaDepth, ETH3D) datasets. How well do you expect the method to generalize to other settings like street scenes or aerial imagery? What domain gaps need to be addressed?

9. For training, the paper uses a simple classification into identified, occluded and out-of-view keypoints. Can a probabilistic or continuous labeling provide more supervision? How can the labeling be made more robust?

10. The method relies on reference keypoints with depth values. How can correspondence hallucination be achieved in a completely unsupervised manner without reference keypoint annotations?
