# [Visual Correspondence Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09711)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:1) Can we develop a neural network architecture that is able to learn to hallucinate/predict visual correspondences between images, even for regions that are occluded or outside the field of view? 2) Is the ability to hallucinate correspondences beneficial for improving the robustness of absolute camera pose estimation?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- They propose and analyze the novel problem of learning to hallucinate correspondences, distinguishing between "identifying", "inpainting", and "outpainting" tasks. - They introduce NeurHal, a network architecture that takes a pair of images and detected keypoints, and outputs probability distributions over possible correspondent locations. The network is trained to identify, inpaint, and outpaint correspondences in a unified manner.- They demonstrate NeurHal's ability to hallucinate correspondences on unseen indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (MegaDepth) scenes.- They show that NeurHal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on absolute camera pose estimation, especially in low-overlap cases where outpainting is critical.So in summary, the main hypotheses are around the feasibility and benefits of correspondence hallucination, which the authors attempt to validate through the proposed NeurHal network and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Proposing the novel task of learning to hallucinate (predict/inpaint/outpaint) visual correspondences between partially overlapping images, including when the correspondent is occluded or outside the field of view. This is in contrast to traditional methods that can only identify correspondences in covisible regions.- Analyzing the specific challenges of this correspondence hallucination task and proposing appropriate loss functions and network architectures to handle identification, inpainting, and outpainting in a unified manner.- Demonstrating through experiments that their proposed NeurHal network can successfully hallucinate correspondences on unseen indoor and outdoor image pairs.- Showing that incorporating correspondence hallucination, especially outpainting, significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of absolute camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods, particularly for image pairs with low overlap.So in summary, the main novelty seems to be introducing and tackling the new problem of correspondence hallucination, and showing its benefits for robust pose estimation. The proposed NeurHal network architecture and training framework to handle hallucination in a unified manner is also a key contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a neural network method for establishing visual correspondences between two partially overlapping images, that can hallucinate the location of occluded or out-of-view correspondences through implicit geometric reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visual correspondence hallucination:- This paper presents one of the first attempts at learning to hallucinate visual correspondences. Most prior work has focused on identifying correspondences in covisible regions using local feature descriptors and matchers. This paper proposes an approach to predict correspondences in non-covisible regions where they cannot be directly identified. - The idea of hallucinating visual content has been explored before in contexts like novel view synthesis or relative pose estimation with limited overlap, but not specifically for correspondences. This paper demonstrates correspondence hallucination on its own is a useful capability.- The proposed NeurHal network architecture is novel in using a non-siamese, cross-attention-based design to allow communication between source and target features and enable hallucination. This differentiates it from prior learning-based feature matching methods based on siamese networks.- The use of the Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) as a loss function is an elegant way to unify the identifying, inpainting and outpainting tasks without needing explicit labels. This simplifies the problem formulation.- Experiments demonstrate NeurHal can hallucinate correspondences for indoor and outdoor scenes it wasn't trained on. Generalization ability is much better than local feature matchers constrained to covisible regions.- For pose estimation, NeurHal significantly outperforms feature matching baselines in low overlap settings where hallucination is needed. In high overlap settings, NeurHal is comparable but not better.Overall, this paper presents a novel task formulation and model design for correspondence hallucination. It demonstrates promising generalization ability not achieved by prior feature matching techniques. The application to robust pose estimation also highlights the practical utility of this capability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the accuracy of the hallucinated correspondences. The authors note that their method produces relatively low-resolution correspondence maps, which limits the accuracy of the predicted correspondences. They suggest exploring architectures and training techniques to produce higher-resolution, more precise correspondence maps.- Generalizing to more complex scenes. The experiments in the paper focus on indoor and outdoor scenes with fairly straightforward geometry. The authors suggest testing the approach on more complex environments with irregular geometries, repetitive structures, transparent/reflective surfaces, etc.- Integrating correspondence hallucination into full 3D reconstruction pipelines like Structure-from-Motion (SfM). The authors propose that correspondence hallucination could make SfM more robust in cases with few input images, by allowing estimation of geometric relationships between images even when keypoints are not co-visible.- Exploring the use of correspondence hallucination for other applications beyond pose estimation, such as novel view synthesis, image editing/manipulation, etc. The ability to hallucinate plausible correspondences between images with limited overlap could be useful for a variety of vision and graphics tasks.- Investigating network architectures and training techniques to allow accurate hallucination over larger spatial ranges. The current method is limited to a fixed range beyond the image borders. Removing this constraint could expand the applicability.- Combining correspondence hallucination with more explicit geometric reasoning within the network, to improve generalization. The current approach relies primarily on visual pattern recognition. Adding explicit modelling of scene geometry could make the hallucination more robust.So in summary, the main directions are: improving accuracy, generalizing to more complex scenes, integrating into 3D pipelines like SfM, exploring new applications, increasing the spatial range, and combining with more structured geometric reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a neural network approach called NeurHal for establishing correspondences between two partially overlapping images. Given a pair of source and target images and a set of keypoints in the source image, NeurHal outputs for each keypoint a probability distribution over its correspondent's location in the target image. This allows NeurHal to predict correspondences even when they are occluded or outside the field of view in the target image, which the authors refer to as "hallucinating" correspondences. The authors show that NeurHal is able to hallucinate correspondences on novel scenes not seen during training. They also demonstrate that NeurHal's ability to hallucinate correspondences makes it significantly more robust for absolute camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods, especially for image pairs with low overlap. The main novelty is the idea of learning to hallucinate correspondences, and the design of a network architecture and loss function that enables this.
