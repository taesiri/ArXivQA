# [Visual Correspondence Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09711)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:1) Can we develop a neural network architecture that is able to learn to hallucinate/predict visual correspondences between images, even for regions that are occluded or outside the field of view? 2) Is the ability to hallucinate correspondences beneficial for improving the robustness of absolute camera pose estimation?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- They propose and analyze the novel problem of learning to hallucinate correspondences, distinguishing between "identifying", "inpainting", and "outpainting" tasks. - They introduce NeurHal, a network architecture that takes a pair of images and detected keypoints, and outputs probability distributions over possible correspondent locations. The network is trained to identify, inpaint, and outpaint correspondences in a unified manner.- They demonstrate NeurHal's ability to hallucinate correspondences on unseen indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (MegaDepth) scenes.- They show that NeurHal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on absolute camera pose estimation, especially in low-overlap cases where outpainting is critical.So in summary, the main hypotheses are around the feasibility and benefits of correspondence hallucination, which the authors attempt to validate through the proposed NeurHal network and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Proposing the novel task of learning to hallucinate (predict/inpaint/outpaint) visual correspondences between partially overlapping images, including when the correspondent is occluded or outside the field of view. This is in contrast to traditional methods that can only identify correspondences in covisible regions.- Analyzing the specific challenges of this correspondence hallucination task and proposing appropriate loss functions and network architectures to handle identification, inpainting, and outpainting in a unified manner.- Demonstrating through experiments that their proposed NeurHal network can successfully hallucinate correspondences on unseen indoor and outdoor image pairs.- Showing that incorporating correspondence hallucination, especially outpainting, significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of absolute camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods, particularly for image pairs with low overlap.So in summary, the main novelty seems to be introducing and tackling the new problem of correspondence hallucination, and showing its benefits for robust pose estimation. The proposed NeurHal network architecture and training framework to handle hallucination in a unified manner is also a key contribution.
