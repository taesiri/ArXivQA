# [Unsupervised Learning of Graph from Recipes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cooking recipes consist of natural language instructions that can be challenging for machines to interpret. The key challenges are: (i) identifying all relevant entities like actions, ingredients, locations; (ii) understanding the temporal flow and logical connections between steps; (iii) handling implicit entities that are not explicitly mentioned.
- Existing methods rely on named entity recognition which fails when entities are implicit or alternate names are used. Also, they don't model the dynamics and causal effects between steps. 
- There is a lack of labelled graph structured data paired with recipes to supervise models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an unsupervised model to transform cooking recipe text into graph representations capturing: (i) key entities like actions, ingredients, locations; (ii) relationships between them reflecting the flow logic.
- The model has two main components:
   1. Entity Identifier: Parses each sentence to identify cooking action, ingredients and locations using a BERT-based classifier. Handles coreference by tracking previously seen entities.
   2. Graph Structure Encoder: Iteratively constructs a graph adjacency matrix and node representations using a GCN, by encoding recipe sentences one-by-one. Learns via a pretext task of node type prediction.
- Additionally has a transformer decoder to reconstruct the recipe text from the graph (graph2text) to provide supervision, by comparing to original recipe.
- Trained using bi-level optimization on cooking action prediction and graph2text reconstruction losses.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a scalable unsupervised approach to transform procedural text to graphical representations capturing key entities, relationships and flow logic.
- Introduces a method to jointly learn graph structure and GNN parameters from scratch using only recipe texts as supervision. 
- Evaluates entity prediction quality against baselines. Also evaluates graph generation quality indirectly via text reconstruction and directly by graph edit distance against human created graphs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised approach to transform cooking recipes into graphs that capture actions, ingredients, locations, and their relationships, using a model that iteratively learns the graph structure and parameters while providing supervision through decoding the graph back into text and comparing it to the original input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a scalable approach to transform procedural texts into graphs while learning discrete and sparse dependencies among the entities using cooking recipes as a case study.

2) Presenting a new method for jointly learning the edge connectivity of a graph in the absence of explicit supervision at the graph level. 

In other words, the paper proposes an unsupervised approach to generate graphs from cooking recipe texts that captures the key actions, ingredients, and their relationships without having access to graph-level supervision. The model learns to identify relevant information from the recipes and generate graph representations in an iterative fashion.

The paper proposes an unsupervised approach to transform cooking recipe texts into graph representations that capture the key actions, ingredients, and their relationships. It uses an entity identifier module to extract relevant entities from the text, a graph structure encoder to iteratively learn the graph connectivity and node representations, and a cooking instruction decoder that decodes the graph back into text as a supervisory signal. The model is trained without explicit graph-level supervision, using techniques like self-supervised pretext tasks. The overall goal is to produce meaningful graph representations of procedures that can facilitate reasoning and inference.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an unsupervised approach to transform procedural text into graphs. What are the main challenges in learning graph structure and parameters without explicit supervision at the graph level? How does the paper address these challenges?

2. The paper uses a pre-trained model to encode instructions and identify relevant entities. What considerations need to be made in entity selection for procedural text compared to factoid-based reading comprehension? How does the model account for these?  

3. The graph structure encoder module jointly learns the adjacency matrix and node representations. Explain the approach taken, including the use of a pretext task, to enable unsupervised training. What are the advantages of this method?

4. The paper generates a sequence of partial graphs as it processes the procedural text sequentially. How does the use of a GRU help in this iterative graph construction process? What capabilities does it add?

5. The cooking instruction decoder generates text from the learned graph representations. Explain how the decoder architecture works and how teacher forcing is utilized during training. What purpose does the decoder serve?  

6. What is the intuition behind using a cycle consistency-based approach of encoding text to graphs and decoding graphs back to text? How does this provide a supervisory signal? What are the limitations?

7. The model is evaluated indirectly using text generation metrics and directly by graph edit distance. Explain these evaluation approaches, including the baselines used. What are the pros and cons?

8. How does the graph representation learned in this paper differ from existing approaches to generate flow graphs from procedural text? What effect does this have on human interpretability versus utility for automated systems?

9. The paper focuses on the cooking domain. What considerations would be necessary if applying this approach to other procedural domains like science experiments or assembly manuals?

10. What ethical concerns need to be considered when generating graphs automatically from textual recipes or other procedural corpora? How might the limitations mentioned in the paper lead to issues?
