# [Multimodal Misinformation Detection in a South African Social Media   Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04052)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a multimodal misinformation detection model called MMiC that is designed to detect fake news and misinformation in the South African social media context. MMiC uses both textual and visual components of social media posts, employing pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders to extract semantic features. The model is evaluated on the benchmark Fakeddit dataset where it matches current state-of-the-art performance, as well as on a new Real411 South African misinformation dataset introduced in this paper. Results demonstrate that incorporating local samples into model training significantly boosts performance on local test data, highlighting the influence of concept drift. Overall, the paper introduces the first South African misinformation dataset, proposes an effective multimodal network that adapts well to local contexts through training, and provides evidence that utilizing both text and images improves model robustness for fine-grained misinformation classification - validating the importance of multimodality for misinformation detection on social platforms.
