# [Temporal True and Surrogate Fitness Landscape Analysis for Expensive   Bi-Objective Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world optimization problems often have computationally expensive fitness functions and multiple conflicting objectives. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SA-EAs) are commonly used to tackle such problems by substituting parts of the optimization process with cheaper-to-evaluate surrogate models. 
- However, there is limited research analyzing the induced "fitness landscapes" of surrogate models and comparing them to the true fitness landscapes, especially for multi-objective problems. Understanding these landscapes is important for designing effective SA-EAs.

Methodology:
- The authors compare true and surrogate landscape features on the BBOB bi-objective benchmark, using a SA-EA with different surrogates like KNN, IDW, IDWR and linear regression.
- Both static (one-time Latin hypercube sampling) and temporal/dynamic (sampling around the population over time) fitness landscape analysis is conducted to extract features like distances, correlations, proportions of local/Pareto optima etc.
- Dimensionality reduction and statistical tests are used to compare true and surrogate landscape features over the course of evolution.
- Random forest regression models are built to predict algorithm performance using temporal landscape features.

Key Findings:
- Static vs temporal analysis showed divergent feature distributions, emphasizing the need for temporal analysis in SA-EAs.
- Surrogate and true landscape features significantly differed but were often correlated. Fitness-based features played an key role.
- Models using both surrogate and true temporal features could effectively predict algorithm performance. This demonstrates the usefulness of analyzing both landscapes.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing and comparing multi-objective surrogate landscapes to the true landscape.
- Demonstrates the utility of temporal landscape analysis in understanding SA-EA behavior.
- Shows promise for using landscape features to predict and improve SA-EA performance.
- Opens up further research directions into online surrogate selection/management in expensive multi-objective optimization.

In summary, this is a comprehensive study analyzing fitness landscapes to gain insights into surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization. The temporal analysis and performance prediction results are novel and impactful.
