# [Prototypical Residual Networks for Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve anomaly detection and localization performance by learning from limited anomalous data. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called Prototypical Residual Network (PRN) to address the key challenges of imbalanced learning, identifying anomalous regions, and handling appearance variations in anomaly detection and localization.

The main hypothesis is that by constructing multi-scale prototypes to represent normal patterns, introducing a multi-size self-attention mechanism to enable variable-sized anomalous feature learning, and generating diverse anomalies for training, the PRN model can accurately detect anomalies and localize anomalous regions of various sizes, shapes and numbers.

The experiments on multiple datasets aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of PRN over state-of-the-art methods in both anomaly detection and localization tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework called Prototypical Residual Network (PRN) for anomaly detection and localization. The key components of PRN include:

- Multi-scale prototypes to explicitly represent the residual features between anomalies and normal patterns at different scales. 

- Multi-scale fusion blocks to enable information exchange across different scales.

- A multi-size self-attention mechanism to detect local inconsistencies within variable-sized receptive fields.

2. It presents anomaly generation strategies to enlarge and diversify the anomalies by considering both seen and unseen anomaly appearance variations.

3. It demonstrates through extensive experiments that PRN achieves state-of-the-art performance on anomaly detection and significantly outperforms previous methods on anomaly localization on four datasets - MVTec AD, DAGM, BTAD and KolektorSDD2.

In summary, the main contribution is a new supervised anomaly detection and localization framework PRN, which incorporates multi-scale residual learning and anomaly generation strategies to address the key challenges of subtle and diverse anomaly appearance, as well as scarcity of abnormal samples. The effectiveness of PRN is validated through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR for the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Prototypical Residual Network (PRN) for more accurate anomaly detection and localization by learning feature residuals of varying scales and sizes between anomalous and normal patterns to reconstruct segmentation maps of anomalous regions.
