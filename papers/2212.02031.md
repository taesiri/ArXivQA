# [Prototypical Residual Networks for Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve anomaly detection and localization performance by learning from limited anomalous data. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called Prototypical Residual Network (PRN) to address the key challenges of imbalanced learning, identifying anomalous regions, and handling appearance variations in anomaly detection and localization.

The main hypothesis is that by constructing multi-scale prototypes to represent normal patterns, introducing a multi-size self-attention mechanism to enable variable-sized anomalous feature learning, and generating diverse anomalies for training, the PRN model can accurately detect anomalies and localize anomalous regions of various sizes, shapes and numbers.

The experiments on multiple datasets aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of PRN over state-of-the-art methods in both anomaly detection and localization tasks.
