# [LLMs in Political Science: Heralding a New Era of Visual Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Political scientists want to analyze images to study political contexts, campaigns, conflicts etc. But image analysis requires expertise in computer vision and machine learning which most political scientists lack. 
- Existing techniques also require specialized hardware like GPUs which limits accessibility. 
- As a result, image analysis has been confined to a small subgroup within political science and progress has been slow.

Proposed Solution:
- Use the large language model (LLM) Gemini for common image understanding tasks like object detection, face recognition, captioning, sentiment analysis etc.
- Gemini delivers highly accurate image annotations without needing computer vision expertise or specialized hardware.
- It only requires a natural language prompt describing what information is needed from the image.

Main Contributions:
- Tested Gemini on a dataset of 688 images related to Central American migrants from 33 diverse news outlets.
- Showed Gemini can detect objects with 86% images rated as excellent, 7% good, 2% average and 5% poor - averaging 3.8 out of 4.
- Illustrated capabilities beyond object detection like face recognition, sentiment analysis and captioning.
- Noted advantages of high accuracy, low latency of 5.5 secs per image, no hardware constraints and ease of use through natural language.
- Concluded Gemini can enable wider image analysis access to political scientists given accuracy, cost and usability.

In summary, the paper demonstrates Gemini can facilitate extensive image research in political science which has so far been restricted to experts with specialized skills and resources. Its natural language interface and zero hardware constraints can make image understanding accessible to most political science researchers.
