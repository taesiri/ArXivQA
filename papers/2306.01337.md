# [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: What is the most effective way to use GPT-4 to solve challenging math problems? The authors evaluate and compare various methods of using GPT-4, including adapting existing techniques like Program of Thoughts (PoT) prompts and Program Synthesis prompts as well as proposing a new conversational framework called \MathChat. The goal is to assess the performance of GPT-4 on difficult high school competition math problems when using these different techniques.Specifically, some key aspects the paper explores regarding using GPT-4 for advanced math problem solving include:- How well does GPT-4 perform on challenging math problems when using vanilla prompting versus techniques like PoT and Program Synthesis? - Does the proposed conversational \MathChat framework provide any benefits over these other methods in terms of problem-solving accuracy?- What are the limitations and failure modes when using GPT-4 for complex math problems? How do these vary across techniques?- What is the extensibility of the \MathChat framework for incorporating different prompts and tools?So in summary, the central research question is focused on evaluating and comparing techniques to effectively apply GPT-4 to difficult, advanced mathematical problem solving. The key hypothesis seems to be that the conversational \MathChat approach will provide advantages over other methods for this application. The paper aims to test this hypothesis through empirical experiments on high school competition math problems.
