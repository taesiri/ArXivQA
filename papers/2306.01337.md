# [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: What is the most effective way to use GPT-4 to solve challenging math problems? The authors evaluate and compare various methods of using GPT-4, including adapting existing techniques like Program of Thoughts (PoT) prompts and Program Synthesis prompts as well as proposing a new conversational framework called \MathChat. The goal is to assess the performance of GPT-4 on difficult high school competition math problems when using these different techniques.Specifically, some key aspects the paper explores regarding using GPT-4 for advanced math problem solving include:- How well does GPT-4 perform on challenging math problems when using vanilla prompting versus techniques like PoT and Program Synthesis? - Does the proposed conversational \MathChat framework provide any benefits over these other methods in terms of problem-solving accuracy?- What are the limitations and failure modes when using GPT-4 for complex math problems? How do these vary across techniques?- What is the extensibility of the \MathChat framework for incorporating different prompts and tools?So in summary, the central research question is focused on evaluating and comparing techniques to effectively apply GPT-4 to difficult, advanced mathematical problem solving. The key hypothesis seems to be that the conversational \MathChat approach will provide advantages over other methods for this application. The paper aims to test this hypothesis through empirical experiments on high school competition math problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The paper proposes MathChat, a conversational framework for mathematical problem solving based on large language models like GPT-4. MathChat allows the model to interact with a user proxy agent in a mock conversation to collaboratively solve math problems. 2. The paper adapts and evaluates several existing methods of using LLMs for math problem solving (like vanilla prompting, Program of Thoughts, Program Synthesis prompting) on GPT-4. 3. The paper performs an empirical evaluation of these methods including MathChat on challenging high school competition math problems from the MATH dataset. The results demonstrate MathChat's effectiveness in improving upon previous methods, reaching 60% accuracy on half of the categories.4. The paper provides an analysis of the failure cases to gain insights into the limitations of GPT-4 on advanced math problem solving. Three main types of failures are identified.5. The paper shows the extensibility of MathChat by testing it with alternative prompts and tools with minimal effort.In summary, the main contributions are proposing the conversational MathChat framework tailored to chat-based LLMs like GPT-4, the empirical evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness on challenging math problems compared to previous methods, and the insights gained through failure analysis. The results showcase the potential of using advanced LLMs like GPT-4 for complex math problem solving.
