# [Long Horizon Temperature Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03686)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research goals seem to be:

- To develop a novel and general approach called Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS) for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions of generative models. 

- To address limitations of existing techniques like myopic temperature scaling for autoregressive models, which greedily scales the next token instead of the full sequence. And to provide a unified scaling mechanism for other models like VAEs/normalizing flows that lack natural notions of temperature scaling.

- To make temperature scaling of joint distributions tractable through techniques like tailored baselines and limiting the suffix horizon length in the variance-reduced LHTS objective.

- To show that LHTS can achieve better likelihood-diversity tradeoffs compared to myopic or pseudo-temperature scaling baselines. And that an LHTS-finetuned model improves performance on a downstream analogy task compared to myopic scaling.

In summary, the main research goals seem to be developing a tractable approach to temperature scale joint distributions rather than myopic scalars, making it compatible across likelihood-based generative models, and demonstrating its advantages over existing temperature scaling techniques. The core hypothesis appears to be that explicit long-horizon temperature scaling can better bias generations towards high joint likelihood regions without sacrificing diversity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method called Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS) for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions of generative models. 

In particular, the key ideas and contributions are:

- LHTS provides a way to do non-myopic temperature scaling that considers the entire joint distribution instead of greedily scaling token-by-token like current approaches. This allows optimizing for high likelihood sequences instead of tokens.

- LHTS is model-agnostic and works for any likelihood-based generative model, not just autoregressive ones. The paper shows examples with diffusion models and transformers.

- The paper introduces techniques like fitting per-sample baselines and limiting suffix horizons to reduce the variance of the LHTS training objective.

- For autoregressive models, a variance-reduced LHTS objective is derived that is amenable to causal architectures.

- The approach involves finetuning models with a temperature-dependent objective, after which sampling from the joint temperature-scaled distribution is tractable.

- Experiments across image and language domains demonstrate LHTS achieves better likelihood-diversity tradeoffs compared to pseudo/myopic temperature scaling baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing LHTS as a general, non-myopic method for temperature scaling of joint distributions in likelihood-based generative models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel method for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions of generative models. LHTS allows for non-myopic and model-agnostic temperature scaling by finetuning likelihood-based models on a temperature-dependent objective. Experiments on diffusion image models and autoregressive language models show LHTS can achieve better tradeoffs between likelihood and diversity compared to existing temperature scaling techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a comparison of some key aspects of this paper to other related work:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel method for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions in generative models. This differs from previous work on temperature scaling, which has focused on myopic approaches for autoregressive models or pseudo-temperature methods for other models. The idea of optimizing for long-horizon likelihoods is novel.

- Most prior work on temperature scaling has focused solely on autoregressive models like GPT. By formulating an objective compatible with any likelihood-based model, this paper generalizes temperature scaling. The experiments on diffusion models demonstrate this.

- For autoregressive models, this paper identifies the myopic nature of standard temperature scaling as an issue, and proposes a principled non-myopic alternative. The derivations for variance reduction are also technically novel.

- The proposed method requires some model finetuning, unlike pure post-hoc approaches like myopic scaling. But the benefit is properly scaling joint likelihoods. This tradeoff between quality and cost is aligned with other work on amortized inference.

- Experimentally, the paper shows consistent improvements in likelihood-diversity tradeoffs compared to baselines. The application to multiple choice QA is also compelling. The simplicity and generality of LHTS suggests it could be widely adopted.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in formalizing temperature scaling objectives for generative models, proposing both efficient and general methods, and demonstrating advantages over prevailing techniques. The principle of optimizing long-horizon likelihoods could inspire new research directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring multi-temperature finetuning further to improve performance. The authors mention that training a single model on a set of discrete temperatures helped balance performance across different temperatures. Further exploring this technique could lead to additional improvements.

- Trying other divergences besides forward KL for the LHTS objective function. The authors used forward KL divergence in their experiments, but other divergences may work better. 

- Applying LHTS to other types of likelihood-based generative models besides the ones tested in the paper. The authors show LHTS works for diffusion and autoregressive models, but it may also be beneficial for things like VAEs, normalizing flows, etc.

- Improving the variance reduction techniques for LHTS, such as better baselines or horizon limits. The paper introduces some techniques to reduce variance, but there may be room for improvement here.

- Developing better evaluation metrics and datasets for measuring the effects of joint temperature scaling. The diversity metrics used in the paper provide some signal, but more targeted metrics could better evaluate the benefits of LHTS.

- Exploring whether LHTS could enable extrapolation to more extreme temperatures beyond what was shown for the character model. The smooth extrapolation observed is promising, but it's unclear how far it can be pushed.

So in summary, some key future directions are exploring multi-temperature finetuning, new divergence objectives, applying LHTS to more models, improving variance reduction, developing better evaluation, and pushing the temperature extrapolation even further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel approach for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions of generative models. LHTS addresses two issues with existing temperature scaling methods: (1) autoregressive models rely on myopic temperature scaling that greedily optimizes the next token, rather than the full sequence; (2) many other generative models like VAEs and normalizing flows rely on pseudo-temperatures instead of proper joint scaling. LHTS provides a unified approach compatible with all likelihood-based generative models. It requires finetuning the model on a temperature-dependent objective to learn a model that can directly sample long-horizon temperature-scaled outputs. Experiments on diffusion image models and transformer language models show LHTS achieves better likelihood and diversity compared to baseline temperature scaling methods. On an analogy task, LHTS improves GPT-2's accuracy by 10% over myopic scaling. Overall, LHTS enables proper joint temperature scaling for generative models in a tractable and unified manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel approach for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions of generative models. Temperature scaling is commonly used to bias generative models towards high-likelihood outputs. However, existing methods like myopic scaling for autoregressive models or pseudo-temperatures for latent variable models are approximations. LHTS aims to perform true joint temperature scaling by directly learning a model to match the scaled distribution. The method involves finetuning a generative model on a temperature-dependent objective, after which the finetuned model can sample from the scaled distribution. For autoregressive models, the paper derives a variance-reduced LHTS objective. Experiments on diffusion image models, character models, and language models show LHTS achieves better likelihood-diversity tradeoffs compared to baseline temperature scaling methods. An analogy task shows LHTS also improves accuracy by 10% over myopic scaling.

In summary, the key ideas proposed are 1) LHTS as a novel approach to joint temperature scaling by finetuning, which is non-myopic and model-agnostic unlike prior methods 2) A variance-reduced formulation of LHTS for autoregressive models 3) Experiments demonstrating improved likelihood-diversity tradeoff and downstream performance compared to myopic or pseudo-temperature scaling baselines. The method contributes a general and principled approach to temperature scaling in generative models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel approach for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions. LHTS aims to address limitations of existing temperature scaling techniques like myopic scaling for autoregressive models, which optimize for next token likelihood instead of full sequence likelihood. The key idea of LHTS is to directly learn a model q_T to match the desired temperature-scaled distribution p_T. Since p_T is intractable, importance sampling is used to rewrite the objective in terms of the original tractable model p. The loss involves reweighting the log-likelihood of each data example by an importance weight based on its likelihood under p and the temperature T. For autoregressive models specifically, the authors derive a lower variance objective that reweights based on suffix likelihood rather than full sequence likelihood. The overall approach allows joint temperature scaling for any likelihood-based generative model. Experiments on diffusion image models, character models, and language models demonstrate improved likelihood and diversity over existing temperature scaling baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem being addressed is the challenge of performing proper temperature scaling for generative models. The paper identifies two main issues:

A) Current temperature scaling for autoregressive models like GPT is a myopic approximation to proper joint temperature scaling. It optimizes greedily for the next token rather than the full sequence.

B) Many non-autoregressive generative models like VAEs and normalizing flows rely on pseudo-temperatures or don't support temperature scaling at all.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel method called Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS). The key ideas behind LHTS are:

- It aims to sample from the true temperature-scaled joint distribution in a non-myopic way, optimizing for the long-horizon likelihood of samples.

- It is compatible with all likelihood-based generative models, not just autoregressive ones.

So in summary, the paper is tackling the problem of how to do principled and general temperature scaling for joint distributions generated by likelihood-based models. LHTS is proposed as a tractable solution that improves upon myopic and pseudo-temperature scaling methods.
