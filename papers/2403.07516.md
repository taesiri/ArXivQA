# [D4D: An RGBD diffusion model to boost monocular depth estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Lack of large-scale labeled data is a key bottleneck for many computer vision tasks like depth estimation, where corresponding RGB images and depth maps are needed for training. Such data is difficult and time-consuming to collect in real-world.  
- Using synthetic data from graphical engines often fails to provide realistic samples. When models trained on synthetic data are deployed in real-world, they tend to perform poorly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Diffusion4D (D4D), a novel training pipeline incorporating a customized 4-channel diffusion model to generate realistic RGBD (RGB+depth) training samples from real-world datasets.

- D4D is based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). It's trained to learn feature distributions from real RGBD datasets through a forward diffusion process which perturbs data to noise over time. The reverse generative process then combines these learned features to output realistic RGBD variations of the real data.

- Two DDPM configurations are used focused on: (1) Gradually increasing depth, (2) Rich detail and depth variations. These complement each other to encompass diverse data distributions in generated samples.

- D4D generated RGBD data is combined with real data to train depth estimation models. This improves model generalization and depth prediction accuracy.

Key Contributions:

1) A new training pipeline using a custom 4-channel diffusion model to generate realistic supplementary RGBD training data.

2) Demonstrates effectiveness of this pipeline to boost performance of depth estimation models (8.2% lower RMSE) over using just real or synthetic data.

3) Analysis provides insights on optimal D4D image resolutions and amount of generated samples for improved depth prediction.

4) New augmented RGBD datasets generated by D4D at varying resolutions to aid future research.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to create realistic synthetic RGBD training data using diffusion models to help overcome lack of labeled real-world data for depth estimation tasks.
