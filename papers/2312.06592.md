# [Flexible visual prompts for in-context learning in computer vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06592)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores adapting recent Video Object Segmentation (VOS) methods to in-context learning (ICL) for the task of binary image segmentation. Unlike existing ICL techniques that merge support images into a grid, VOS methods process images individually, allowing flexible support set sizes and no resolution constraints. The authors propose using the state-of-the-art XMem VOS approach for ICL, additionally training it on diverse image datasets (XMem+T). Through extensive experiments, their method is shown to excel at generalizing to unseen classes compared to previous ICL techniques. Further, a support set selection strategy is introduced that chooses the most relevant support images using visual similarity. This selection substantially boosts performance across all tested ICL methods, without needing additional training. By combining VOS, image training, and support set selection, the proposed approach delivers superior overall binary segmentation capability. Notably, it achieves top performance on five diverse out-of-distribution datasets containing unseen classes. The adaptations enable a single model to flexibly segment various objects using tailored support sets, offering versatility for practical applications.
