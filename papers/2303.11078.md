# [Model Barrier: A Compact Un-Transferable Isolation Domain for Model   Intellectual Property Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11078)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to protect the intellectual property of well-trained deep learning models. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a method to prevent illegal transfer or unauthorized use of models by limiting their performance to authorized domains specified by the model owner.

The key hypothesis is that constructing an "isolation domain" with similar private features to the authorized domain can act as a barrier to block illegal cross-domain transfer and lead to failure of the model on unauthorized domains.

In summary, the main research question is how to protect model IP by constraining model generalization, and the core hypothesis is that a compact un-transferable isolation domain can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel approach called Compact Un-Transferable Isolation Domain (CUTI-domain) to protect model intellectual property (IP) by preventing illegal transfers from authorized to unauthorized domains. 

2. It provides two solutions for using CUTI-domain depending on whether the unauthorized domain is known or not: target-specified CUTI-domain and target-free CUTI-domain.

3. It demonstrates through comprehensive experiments on various datasets that CUTI-domain can effectively reduce model recognition ability on unauthorized domains while maintaining strong performance on authorized domains. The proposed method works as a plug-and-play module with different backbone networks.

In summary, this paper makes the key contribution of developing CUTI-domain as an efficient barrier for model IP protection against illegal transfers. The proposed approach is shown to be effective and flexible through evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets.
