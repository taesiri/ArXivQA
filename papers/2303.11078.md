# [Model Barrier: A Compact Un-Transferable Isolation Domain for Model   Intellectual Property Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11078)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to protect the intellectual property of well-trained deep learning models. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a method to prevent illegal transfer or unauthorized use of models by limiting their performance to authorized domains specified by the model owner.

The key hypothesis is that constructing an "isolation domain" with similar private features to the authorized domain can act as a barrier to block illegal cross-domain transfer and lead to failure of the model on unauthorized domains.

In summary, the main research question is how to protect model IP by constraining model generalization, and the core hypothesis is that a compact un-transferable isolation domain can achieve this goal.
