# [Simple is Better and Large is Not Enough: Towards Ensembling of   Foundational Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12272)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that ensembling smaller foundational language models (FLMs) like BERT can achieve comparable or better performance compared to larger individual FLMs. 

The key points are:

- Larger FLMs like XLNet and T5 have advanced NLP, but can still exhibit issues like hallucination and uncertainty. 

- Larger FLMs are built on the same foundations as smaller FLMs like BERT. So smaller FLMs have potential that can be realized through ensembling.

- The authors propose and evaluate three ensemble strategies to combine knowledge from both small and large BERT models: Shallow, Semi, and Deep Ensembles. 

- The Deep Ensemble introduces a knowledge-guided reinforcement learning approach.

- Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show their ensembles of smaller BERT models can outperform or match larger individual BERT models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that ensembling smaller FLMs like BERT can unlock their potential and achieve comparable or better performance than relying solely on scaling up to larger individual models. The experiments aim to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Empirically investigating the performance of BERT models of different sizes (tiny, mini, base, large) on benchmark and real-world NLP datasets. 

- Proposing three ensemble methods to combine BERT models:
   - Shallow Ensemble: Weighted averaging of model probabilities
   - Semi Ensemble: Combining model embeddings and training a smaller model
   - Deep Ensemble: Using knowledge graphs to generate rewards for reinforcement learning

- Evaluating the proposed ensembles on 4 datasets: GoEmotions, SNLI, PRIMATE, Twitter COVID-19

- Showing that the proposed ensembles, especially Deep Ensemble, outperform individual BERT models in many cases, demonstrating the value of ensembling smaller BERT models.

- Highlighting issues like spuriousness and brittleness in large standalone language models, which can be mitigated through ensembling.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating simple but effective ensembling techniques to improve BERT model performance, showing that ensembles of smaller models can approach or exceed larger individual models. The proposed Deep Ensemble with knowledge graph rewards is a particularly novel technique in this context.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates ensembling techniques for Foundational Language Models (FLMs) like BERT to improve their performance on natural language classification tasks. The authors hypothesize that ensembling smaller BERT models can offset issues like hallucination and uncertainty that arise with larger single BERT models. They propose three ensemble strategies: Shallow Ensemble which averages probability outputs, Semi Ensemble which combines sentence embeddings before a classifier, and Deep Ensemble which uses knowledge graphs to generate rewards within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show the ensemble methods consistently improve over individual BERT models, with Deep Ensemble achieving the best performance overall. The key takeaway is that ensembling smaller BERT models can match or exceed the accuracy of large individual BERT models while being more efficient and robust.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates ensembling methods for foundational language models (FLMs) like BERT to improve their performance on natural language processing tasks. The authors hypothesize that ensembling smaller FLMs can provide comparable or better performance compared to larger individual FLMs. This is because larger FLMs built on the same foundations can exhibit issues like hallucination and predictive uncertainty. The authors propose three ensembling strategies: 1) Shallow ensembling that averages model predictions, 2) Semi ensembling that combines model embeddings before prediction, and 3) Deep ensembling that incorporates knowledge graph embeddings and reinforcement learning. The ensembling methods are evaluated on benchmark datasets like GoEmotions and SNLI as well as real-world datasets. Results show the ensemble models often outperform individual large BERT models and achieve competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models like XLNet and T5. Specifically, the deep ensemble method performs the best by leveraging external knowledge. 

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that ensembling smaller BERT models provides comparable or superior performance to large individual BERT models for NLP tasks. The deep ensemble method that incorporates knowledge graphs and reinforcement learning is especially effective. The results suggest that effective ensembling strategies can allow smaller FLMs to match larger models, providing efficiency benefits.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes using ensembles of BERT models for natural language classification tasks. The key ideas are:

1. They create 3 ensemble methods - Shallow Ensemble (ShE), Semi Ensemble (SE), and Deep Ensemble (DE). 

2. ShE averages the predicted probabilities from different BERT models. 

3. SE combines the embeddings from different BERT models and feeds to a classifier.

4. DE uses knowledge graph embeddings from Wikipedia and ConceptNet along with BERT embeddings, and tunes the classifier loss using a reinforcement learning policy gradient method.

5. They evaluate the ensembles on benchmark datasets like GoEmotions and SNLI as well as real-world datasets like PRIMATE and Twitter. 

6. The ensembles, especially DE, outperform the individual BERT models as well as larger models like XLNet and T5 in most cases, showing the benefits of ensembling smaller BERT models. 

In summary, the paper demonstrates simple but effective ensembling techniques to improve BERT model performance for text classification tasks, without requiring much larger BERT variants. The DE method leverages external knowledge to further boost accuracy.
