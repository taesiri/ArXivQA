# [PDETime: Rethinking Long-Term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting from   the perspective of partial differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Long-term multivariate time series forecasting (LMTSF) is challenging because the temporal relationships and dynamic trends are complex to model over long horizons. Existing methods either rely purely on the historical values or treat time as an additional input feature. These approaches have limitations in capturing the complex temporal dependencies. 

Method:
The paper proposes a new framework PDETime that formulates LMTSF as an initial value problem of partial differential equations (PDE). Specifically, PDETime models the dynamic evolution of a time series by a PDE parameterized by implicit neural representations (INR). It includes two modules - an Estimator module that estimates the PDE parameters and a Forecaster module that forecasts by solving the resulting PDE with predicted parameters. 

The key idea is to model the derivative of hidden states over time instead of modeling the states directly. This allows capturing complex temporal relationships and long-term dependencies. The INR allows representing arbitrary functions and provides flexibility to model diverse time series dynamics.

Contributions:
- Novel formulation of LMTSF as a PDE parameterized by INRs. This is the first work to model time series forecasting using PDEs.
- An end-to-end differentiable framework PDETime to estimate the PDE and forecast in a unified manner.
- State-of-the-art performance on 7 real-world datasets beating Transformer-based and other models. The method shows better long-term robustness.
- Ablation studies validating the modeling choices and detailed analysis of hyperparameters.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative PDE perspective for time series forecasting and develops an effective framework achieving new state-of-the-art. The PDE formulation and INR modeling provide new opportunities to capture complex temporal dynamics.
