# [NeRFiller: Completing Scenes via Generative 3D Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04560)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes NeRFiller, a novel approach for completing missing portions of 3D scenes or objects using an off-the-shelf 2D image generative model. The key idea is to leverage diffusion models like Stable Diffusion in a way that encourages multi-view consistency when inpainting multiple images depicting a 3D scene. The authors first identify a "grid prior" phenomenon where tiling images in a grid configuration produces more consistent inpaints. They extend this to multiple images with a joint multi-view inpainting method that shares information across images. To distill these 2D inpaints into a full 3D scene, they propose an optimization framework called Inpaint Iterative Dataset Update that alternates between rendering the current NeRF model, inpainting the rendered images, and updating the NeRF with the new inpaints as supervision. Experiments across diverse scene completion tasks demonstrate NeRFiller's ability to plausibly complete missing regions in more 3D consistent ways compared to state-of-the-art methods. The approach also allows conditioning the inpainting on reference images to guide the completion. Limitations include difficulty recovering high-frequency details and handling large missing regions from casual captures. Overall, NeRFiller presents an effective way to leverage 2D generative models to complete 3D scenes in a controllable manner.
