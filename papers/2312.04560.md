# [NeRFiller: Completing Scenes via Generative 3D Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04560)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes NeRFiller, a novel approach for completing missing portions of 3D scenes or objects using an off-the-shelf 2D image generative model. The key idea is to leverage diffusion models like Stable Diffusion in a way that encourages multi-view consistency when inpainting multiple images depicting a 3D scene. The authors first identify a "grid prior" phenomenon where tiling images in a grid configuration produces more consistent inpaints. They extend this to multiple images with a joint multi-view inpainting method that shares information across images. To distill these 2D inpaints into a full 3D scene, they propose an optimization framework called Inpaint Iterative Dataset Update that alternates between rendering the current NeRF model, inpainting the rendered images, and updating the NeRF with the new inpaints as supervision. Experiments across diverse scene completion tasks demonstrate NeRFiller's ability to plausibly complete missing regions in more 3D consistent ways compared to state-of-the-art methods. The approach also allows conditioning the inpainting on reference images to guide the completion. Limitations include difficulty recovering high-frequency details and handling large missing regions from casual captures. Overall, NeRFiller presents an effective way to leverage 2D generative models to complete 3D scenes in a controllable manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NeRFiller, a generative 3D inpainting method that completes missing portions of 3D scenes by leveraging an off-the-shelf 2D image inpainting model in a way that encourages multi-view consistency, enabling the synthesis of complete 3D scenes from incomplete observations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing NeRFiller, a generative 3D inpainting approach for completing missing regions in 3D scenes or objects. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Identifying a "Grid Prior" phenomenon where inpainting a 2x2 grid of images with a diffusion model encourages more consistent outputs across views compared to inpainting images individually. 

2) Proposing "Joint Multi-View Inpainting", which extends the Grid Prior to inpaint batches of images larger than 4 while maintaining improved multi-view consistency. This involves tiling images into grids, getting diffusion model predictions, and averaging predictions before each denoising step.

3) Presenting an iterative framework called "Inpaint DU" to consolidate the 2D inpaints from Joint Multi-View Inpainting into a single globally consistent 3D NeRF scene representation. This distills the 2D inpaint details into the 3D scene in a robust way.

4) Demonstrating qualitatively and quantitatively that NeRFiller can plausibly complete missing regions in a variety of 3D scenes and objects, outperforming existing methods adapted to the task of scene completion rather than just foreground object removal.

In summary, the main contribution is the NeRFiller framework and its components that enable generative 3D scene completion from an off-the-shelf 2D generative model in a multi-view consistent way.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "Grid Prior" approach where images are tiled in a 2x2 grid during inpainting to encourage consistency. Why do you think this simple technique is effective at improving consistency compared to inpainting images independently? What are some ways this grid prior idea could be extended or improved?

2. The Joint Multi-View Inpainting method generalizes the Grid Prior idea to work with more than 4 images. Explain the averaging procedure used across random grid combinations and why averaging the noise predictions helps improve consistency. How else could information be shared across views during inpainting?

3. The paper uses an iterative optimization procedure called Inpaint DU to consolidate the 2D inpaints into a 3D scene. Explain the differences between this approach and using Score Distillation Sampling. What are the tradeoffs?

4. How exactly does the depth regularization loss used during Inpaint DU help improve the geometry? Why use a relative depth ranking loss instead of direct supervision? What implications does this have? 

5. The paper evaluates consistency by measuring similarity of the latest inpaints to final rendered images. Discuss the limitations of this approach and how ground truth data could better quantify performance if available.

6. Look at Figure 8 in the paper. Analyze and critique the visual results of each method. Which aspects work well and which could be improved for each one? What visual artifacts are still present in the proposed method?

7. The paper mentions casual captures as an application of their approach but points out mask distribution differences that cause issues. Elaborate on this problem and discuss potential solutions if one wanted to enable inpainting on this type of data.

8. How do you think NeRFiller would perform if applied to video data instead of still images? What changes would need to be made to handle video frames?

9. The paper uses an off-the-shelf diffusion model and does not require purpose-trained networks. Discuss the pros and cons of this approach compared to using a model specially fine-tuned for inpainting tasks.

10. The problem formulation focuses on completing arbitrarily missing regions instead of tightly masked foreground objects. Compare and contrast these two settings. How does it affect the methodology and results? What unique challenges does scene completion introduce?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NeRFiller: Completing Scenes via Generative 3D Inpainting":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of completing missing or undesirable parts in 3D scene captures. For example, in scanned 3D objects there may be unobserved regions like the bottom side of objects that were not captured. Or there may be unwanted artifacts like price tags that one may want to remove. The goal is to fill in these missing or unwanted parts in a seamless way while maintaining 3D consistency across views.

Method:
The paper proposes a new method called NeRFiller that leverages 2D image inpainting models to generate missing content, and "distills" these 2D inpaints into a full 3D scene completion using neural radiance fields (NeRFs). The key ideas are:

1) Identify a "Grid Prior" phenomenon where a 2x2 grid of images inpainted together leads to more 3D consistent image completions than inpainting images independently. 

2) Generalize this to larger sets of images with a new technique called "Joint Multi-View Inpainting", which shares context across images during diffusion model sampling.

3) Iteratively optimize a NeRF scene representation to consolidate the 2D image completions into a single 3D completed result. This uses a new training procedure called "Inpaint Dataset Update".

4) Optionally incorporate depth maps to improve geometry.

Contributions:
- The novel discovery and application of the Grid Prior idea for 3D consistent image inpainting.

- A new Joint Multi-View Inpainting technique to share context across images during diffusion sampling.

- A framework (NeRFiller) to iteratively distill 2D image completions into a full 3D scene completion.

- Comparisons to prior work adapted to their setting showing NeRFiller produces more 3D consistent and realistic scene completions.

The method allows completing challenging cases like large missing regions in scenes, without tight foreground masks or text prompts that prior work depends on. Limitations include lower resolution results and difficulty handling extreme casual capture artifacts.
