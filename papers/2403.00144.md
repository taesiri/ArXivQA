# [EBBS: An Ensemble with Bi-Level Beam Search for Zero-Shot Machine   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00144)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Zero-shot machine translation requires translating between language pairs not seen during training. This is important for low-resource languages but is challenging. 
- Existing methods like direct translation by multilingual models or pivoting through English produce noisy, low-quality outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multi-pivot ensemble approach that aggregates outputs from direct translation and pivoting through different languages.
- Design a novel bi-level beam search algorithm (EBBS) for decoding the ensemble:
   - Lower level: Each ensemble component explores its own prediction space using beam search
   - Upper level: Beams are synchronized across components through a soft voting method  
- EBBS allows components to correct each other's mistakes by voting out spurious candidates

Main Contributions:
- Propose EBBS, a first-of-its-kind beam search algorithm for ensembles by coordinating multiple weak models
- EBBS gives better performance than direct translation, pivoting and other ensemble methods like word-level averaging and minimum Bayes risk  
- Show EBBS works well to combine both strong and weak individual components 
- Demonstrate EBBS outputs can be used to distill knowledge back into the base model, improving efficiency 2-3x while retaining (and sometimes improving) performance

Overall, the paper addresses an important NLP problem via a novel bi-level beam search algorithm that enables an ensemble to generate high-quality translations for zero-shot language pairs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes EBBS, a novel ensemble method with bi-level beam search for zero-shot machine translation, which allows ensemble components to explore independently while synchronizing through a soft voting mechanism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing EBBS, a novel ensemble method with bi-level beam search for zero-shot machine translation. Specifically:

- They propose a bi-level beam search algorithm (EBBS) that allows different ensemble components (direct translation, pivot translation through different languages) to explore their own predictions at the lower level but synchronizes them through a soft voting mechanism at the upper level. This allows the ensemble to generate high-quality translations.

- They evaluate EBBS on two popular zero-shot translation datasets IWSLT and Europarl. Results show that EBBS consistently outperforms existing ensemble techniques as well as direct and pivot translations.

- They further use the high-quality EBBS outputs to distill knowledge back into the multilingual model. This distillation approach improves inference efficiency significantly while retaining (sometimes even improving) translation quality.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel EBBS algorithm for zero-shot machine translation and demonstrating its effectiveness over strong baselines. The additional contribution is showing EBBS outputs can be used to improve efficiency via distillation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Zero-shot machine translation - Translating between language pairs not seen explicitly during training. A key focus of the paper.

- Multilingual translation model - A single model trained on multiple languages that can translate between language pairs, including zero-shot directions. The base model used in the paper.

- Direct translation - Translating directly between a source and target language using a multilingual model, without an intermediate pivot language. One of the ensemble components.

- Pivot translation - Translating between a language pair by first translating to/from a third pivot language like English. Another ensemble component.  

- Ensemble learning - Combining multiple models or components to produce better performance than individually. A key technique explored in the paper.

- EBBS - Ensemble with Bi-Level Beam Search, the proposed novel ensemble decoding algorithm. Allows components to explore separately while synchronizing via a voting mechanism.

- Knowledge distillation - Using the EBBS ensemble outputs to teach the multilingual model, improving efficiency while maintaining quality.

- Beam search - A search algorithm that maintains the most promising candidates at each step. EBBS extends this with a bi-level structure.

Some other terms include BLEU score, sequence generation, prediction entropy, IWSLT and Europarl datasets for machine translation. But the terms above seem to be the most essential for summarizing this paper's key contributions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an ensemble method with bi-level beam search (EBBS) for zero-shot machine translation. Can you explain in detail how the bi-level beam search algorithm works? What are the key differences compared to standard beam search?

2. The lower-level and upper-level beams in EBBS may use different sizes. Have the authors analyzed how the choice of beam sizes impacts performance? What beam sizes work the best? 

3. The paper compares EBBS against several alternative ensembles, including word-level and sequence-level techniques. Can you analyze the pros and cons of these different ensembles and explain why EBBS outperforms them?

4. EBBS performs a soft voting to synchronize lower-level beams. The paper implements a sum-voting scheme. What other voting schemes are possible and how do they compare? Provide a detailed analysis.  

5. The authors claim EBBS mitigates the over-smoothing problem in ensembles. Can you explain what the over-smoothing problem is and how the bi-level search in EBBS helps address it?

6. For the ensemble components, the paper uses direct translation and pivoting through different languages. What are the challenges when choosing ensemble components for zero-shot translation? How does EBBS overcome some of these challenges?

7. The authors apply EBBS to two datasets, IWSLT and Europarl, with different characteristics. Analyze the results and discuss when EBBS is most effective and why.

8. The paper further proposes an EBBS-based knowledge distillation technique. Explain how this distillation process works and why it outperforms alternative distillation methods.

9. From analyzing the inference efficiency (Figure 5), estimate how the running time of EBBS would increase if 10 ensemble components were used instead of 3. Explain your analysis.  

10. The authors claim EBBS is widely applicable to text generation tasks. Can you think of other generation tasks where EBBS could be readily applied? What modifications might be needed? Discuss the feasibility.
