# [LLaMA Pro: Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to lose their general capabilities when adapted to specific domains through post-pretraining, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. There is a need for methods to inject domain knowledge into LLMs while preserving general abilities.

Method - Block Expansion:
- The authors propose a block expansion technique to expand an existing LLM by adding new transformer blocks that are tuned on domain-specific data, while freezing original blocks to retain general capabilities.

- Specifically, they initialize new blocks to identity mappings so output is preserved initially. The added blocks are then tuned on domain corpus like code or math, adapting model to that domain.

- After tuning expanded blocks, the model excels on both general NLP and specialized domain tasks, balancing capabilities.

Models & Results:
- The authors use block expansion on LLaMA2-7B base model, adding 8 blocks & tuning on code/math data to create LLaMA-Pro (8.3B parameters).

- Further instruction tuning creates LLaMA-Pro Instruct model. Experiments show SOTA results on general NLP, code tasks (HumanEval, MBPP) and math tasks (GSM8K), superior to other LLaMA models.

- Evaluations on agent benchmarks like MINT and MT-Bench also demonstrate LLaMA-Pro Instruct's effectiveness on multi-turn interactions and as a conversational assistant.

Contributions:
- A novel block expansion method that adapts LLMs to domains while retaining general skills. Shows one can balance specialized and general abilities.

- Introduction of LLaMA-Pro models that integrate natural language, code & math capabilities at a low compute cost.

- Extensive evaluations demonstrating LLaMA-Pro models' versatility and state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a progressive training method called block expansion that expands transformer blocks in a pre-trained language model using copied identity blocks tuned on domain-specific data, enhancing domain knowledge while preserving general capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It proposes a novel post-pretraining method for large language models called block expansion. This method enables injecting new knowledge into LLMs while preserving their original capabilities by expanding the model with copied Transformer blocks and tuning only the new blocks. 

2. It introduces LLaMA Pro and LLaMA Pro - Instruct, versatile LLMs that integrate natural and programming languages well, excelling in general tasks, programming, and mathematics.

3. It benchmarks the LLaMA Pro family of models on extensive datasets, including both traditional benchmarks and agent-oriented tasks, demonstrating the model's superiority and potential for broader complex applications.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed block expansion methodology that enables enhancing LLMs' domain-specific abilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of their general knowledge. The paper also showcases strong empirical results from models trained with this approach.
