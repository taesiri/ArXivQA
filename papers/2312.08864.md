# [RankDVQA-mini: Knowledge Distillation-Driven Deep Video Quality   Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08864)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a compact deep video quality assessment model called RankDVQA-mini that achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring substantially lower complexity compared to existing deep VQA methods. Specifically, the authors employ a two-phase framework that first prunes the parameters of RankDVQA, one of the latest and top-performing learning-based quality metrics, using sparsity-inducing optimization and channel pruning to retain only 10% of parameters. The resulting compact model is then trained via a multi-level knowledge distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from the original unpruned teacher RankDVQA model to the pruned student at instance, batch, and class levels. The final RankDVQA-mini model reduces FLOPs by 86% and parameters by 90% compared to RankDVQA, while still achieving competitive correlation performance that surpasses most existing deep VQA approaches on eight benchmark datasets. For example, RankDVQA-mini attains similar overall performance as the leading conventional metric VMAF but with substantially lower complexity. The work represents an important step towards developing efficient deep VQA models for practical deployment.
