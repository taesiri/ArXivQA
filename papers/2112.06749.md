# [Step-unrolled Denoising Autoencoders for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06749)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop an effective non-autoregressive text generation model that can generate high-quality and coherent text without relying on autoregressive models. Specifically, the paper proposes a new generative model called Step-unrolled Denoising Autoencoder (SUNDAE) that operates as a time-homogeneous Markov chain to iteratively denoise and improve random text inputs until they converge to coherent samples. The key hypothesis is that "unrolling" the denoising process during training by feeding generated samples back into the model will allow SUNDAE to outperform standard denoising autoencoders and generation methods like diffusion models.The researchers test this hypothesis by evaluating SUNDAE on unconditional text generation using the C4 and GitHub Python datasets as well as on English-German machine translation using the WMT 2014 dataset. Their goal is to show that SUNDAE can achieve strong results on these tasks compared to other non-autoregressive baselines without relying on distillation from a pretrained autoregressive model.In summary, the central research question is whether the proposed unrolled denoising training approach can enable a non-autoregressive model like SUNDAE to generate high-quality text while overcoming issues like multimodality. The results on various datasets aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method compared to other non-autoregressive techniques.
