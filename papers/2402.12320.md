# [Landmark Stereo Dataset for Landmark Recognition and Moving Node   Localization in a Non-GPS Battlefield Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12320)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Establishing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for tracking and guiding troops in battlefield environments is challenging due to lack of GPS connectivity and difficulties in deploying physical anchor nodes. 

- Existing solutions like range-free DV-Hop localization have drawbacks like reliance on anchor nodes, errors in hop distance estimation, vulnerability to attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- Use landmarks (buildings, towers etc) in the battlefield area as anchor nodes to obtain virtual coordinates of mobile nodes (troops).

- A mobile node captures stereo images of landmarks using a stereo camera and sends them to a control server.

- Server runs YOLOv5 model to detect and recognize landmarks in images.

- Improved SGM algorithm generates depth map from stereo images to estimate distance between node and landmarks.

- Landmark ID and estimated distance stored as virtual coordinates of mobile node.

- Later trilateration done using virtual coordinates for node localization.

Key Contributions:

- Creation of two datasets - MSTLandmarkv1 for model training and MSTLandmarkStereov1 for algorithm validation

- Eliminates reliance on GPS and deployment of fragile physical anchors in harsh battlefield environments

- Landmark recognition using YOLOv5 model with 0.95 mAP accuracy

- Distance estimation to landmarks integrated with recognition using stereo vision and improved SGM algorithm 

- Concept of landmark-based virtual coordinates for mobile nodes to enable tracking and path optimization

In summary, the paper presents a reliable landmark-based framework using stereo vision and deep learning for mobile node localization in GPS-denied battlefield environments.
