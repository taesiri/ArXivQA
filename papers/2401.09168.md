# [Fine-tuning Strategies for Domain Specific Question Answering under Low   Annotation Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard fine-tuning strategy (PLM → SQuAD → TargetQA) for question answering (QA) models is suboptimal when there is a low annotation budget for the target QA dataset. Low budgets are common in practice due to high cost of extractive QA annotation.

- Need to determine best fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific QA under low annotation budget constraints.

Methods:
- Compared 18 fine-tuning strategies over 4 domain datasets (COVID-QA, CUAD-QA, MovieQA, KG-QA) with varying similarity to SQuAD dataset.

- Tested 6 budget sizes from 100 to 1600 examples to simulate low to higher budget scenarios.

- Evaluated if additional pretraining with Masked LM helps in low budget cases. 

- Analyzed impact of different strategies for merging SQuAD and target QA data during fine-tuning.

Key Findings:
- Standard QA fine-tuning strategy significantly underperforms compared to best approach, especially in very low budget scenarios (by up to 12.5% difference).

- Fine-tuning on a mix of partial SQuAD and oversampled target QA data works best across budgets and domains.

- Masked LM provides no benefits for domain QA in low budget settings.

- Low annotation budgets (200 samples) are highly efficient if right fine-tuning approach is used.  

- Budget increase only yields minor gains up until 1600+ samples are used.

Main Contributions:
- First exhaustive comparison of QA fine-tuning strategies under low annotation budgets
- Demonstration that standard QA fine-tuning pipeline is suboptimal 
- Guidelines for best practices for training domain-specific QA systems on a budget
- Analysis of expected model improvement vs annotation budget


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that the standard sequential fine-tuning strategy for question answering is sub-optimal under low annotation budget constraints, and proposes merge fine-tuning as a more effective approach, especially with oversampling of the target domain data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A study comparing different fine-tuning strategies for extractive question answering under low annotation budget constraints. The paper examines 108 different strategies on 4 datasets totaling over 1900 fine-tuned models.

2) Demonstrating that the standard sequential fine-tuning strategy commonly used for question answering is sub-optimal under low budgets. 

3) Showing that a merging strategy, specifically fine-tuning on a mix of SQuAD and target domain data, works best for low budgets. The best overall strategy is fine-tuning on a mix of oversampled target data and full SQuAD. 

4) Analysis of performance gains from increasing annotation budget. The paper concludes it's best to either go with a small ($200$) or large ($1600+$) budget, as budgets in between have diminishing returns for the annotation effort.

5) Showing pre-training with masked language modeling on small domain corpora does not improve performance, contrary to its usefulness on other tasks.

So in summary, the main contribution is an exhaustive study of QA fine-tuning strategies under low budgets, yielding practical advice for real-world model development.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares different fine-tuning strategies for extractive question answering under low annotation budgets. Can you explain in more detail the rationale behind using annotation budget as a key experimental variable? Why is a low annotation budget a common real-world constraint?

2. The standard fine-tuning strategy for QA involves pre-training on SQuAD before fine-tuning on the target dataset. Can you explain why this strategy performs suboptimally under low annotation budgets? What issues does it run into? 

3. The paper explores merging SQuAD data with the target dataset during fine-tuning. What is the motivation behind this merging approach? How does it help mitigate issues with the standard fine-tuning strategy?

4. What were the different strategies explored for merging SQuAD and the target dataset? Can you explain in detail the MP, MPO, MW, and MWO merging approaches? 

5. Why does the paper conclude that knowledge-alignment pre-training via masked language modeling is not beneficial under low annotation budgets? What explanation is provided for this result?

6. Can you analyze the results in Table 3 more deeply? Why does performance improve more significantly from zero-shot to low annotation budget compared to from low to high budget?

7. Figure 2 shows the relative performance gain as annotation budget increases. What trend is shown and what practical advice does the paper give based on this result? Explain.  

8. How does the paper analyze the similarity between the SQuAD dataset and each target dataset? What metrics are used and what is concluded from this analysis?

9. The paper explores curriculum learning for introducing training examples. Why was this approach ultimately unsuccessful? What potential reasons are given?

10. If you were to extend this work, what are some ways you might modify or improve upon the fine-tuning strategies explored? What other techniques could be beneficial to try?
