# [Becoming self-instruct: introducing early stopping criteria for minimal   instruct tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03692)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a metric to measure a language model's ability to follow instructions, and use this to better understand and control the instruction tuning process?

More specifically, some key goals and hypotheses appear to be:

- Introducing the Instruction Following Score (IFS) as a metric to detect language models' ability to respond to instructions in a conversational, "answer-like" way. The hypothesis is that IFS can distinguish between base and instruct models.

- Using IFS to analyze the instruction tuning process over the course of training, with the goal of finding an early stopping point or "minimal" instruct tuning that achieves good performance without unnecessary semantic drift from the base model. 

- Proposing the auxiliary ObjecQA metric to contrast IFS with acquisition of semantic knowledge during instruct tuning. The hypothesis is that IFS plateaus while ObjecQA continues increasing, indicating disjoint phases of "format-infusion" and "knowledge-infusion."

- Demonstrating the feasibility of using IFS and ObjecQA to decompose instruct tuning and identify minimal tuning conditions. The broader goal is enabling better control over instruct tuning to balance performance and preservation of base model capabilities.

In summary, the key research question is how to develop metrics like IFS that provide insight into the instruction tuning process, in order to achieve better controllable and minimal instruct tuning. The hypotheses focus on using IFS and ObjecQA to distinguish training phases and identify minimal tuning criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the Instruction Following Score (IFS), a metric that measures a language model's ability to follow instructions. The metric calculates the ratio of "answer-like" vs "continuation-like" responses when prompted with instructions.

2. Using IFS to benchmark different base and instruct-tuned language models. The results show IFS can effectively distinguish between base and instruct models. 

3. Applying IFS to track the training process of 7B and 13B LLaMA models during supervised fine-tuning. This reveals instruction following ability is learned early on, while further training leads to semantic/knowledge changes. 

4. Proposing the supplementary ObjecQA metric to contrast tone changes (measured by IFS) with semantic shifts during instruct tuning. For the inspected models, format infusion and knowledge infusion occur in disjoint phases.

5. Suggesting the metrics could help design minimal instruct interfaces that align models with conversational tone while minimizing unintended semantic side effects from prolonged instruct tuning.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing IFS to quantify instruction following, using it to analyze instruct tuning, and proposing the metrics could help build better controlled instruct interfaces. The key insight is instruction tone alignment can be decoupled from semantic/knowledge gains during tuning.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the study to include more base LLMs and datasets to see if the observed disjoint format-infusion and knowledge-infusion phases generalize. The authors suggest this could lead to more robust heuristics for controlling instruct tuning phases.

- Investigating other auxiliary metrics beyond ObjecQA that could reveal insights into model semantics and knowledge acquisition during instruct tuning. The authors propose composable feature blocks could help achieve desired alignment aspects without unexpected semantic shifts.

- Exploring early stopping criteria and minimal tuning techniques to create "tone-instruct" models - models with enough instruct ability to have conversational tone but minimized impact on base model semantics.

- Looking at other instruct tuning methods like reinforcement learning and human feedback beyond supervised finetuning.

- Developing more sophisticated response classifiers that go beyond binary tone detection and can disentangle factors like helpfulness, formality, strict formats.

- Generalizing the idea of designing minimal interfaces for querying foundation models instead of doing full instruct tuning.

Overall, the authors aim to spur research into more controllable and interpretable instruct tuning to create interfaces for foundation models that achieve conversational abilities without sacrificing desirable base model qualities. Key suggestions focus on new metrics, stopping criteria, composable modules, and querying interfaces.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper introduces the Instruction Following Score (IFS), a metric to evaluate whether language models follow instructions by classifying their responses as either "answer-like" or "continuation-like". IFS ratios effectively distinguish between base and instruct models. The paper calculates IFS during supervised finetuning of 7B and 13B LLaMA models, finding instruct capabilities plateau early around 8k examples. To contrast tone and semantic changes, an auxiliary metric ObjecQA measures model objectivity. Results show format-infusion happens first when IFS peaks, while knowledge-infusion causing semantic shifts continues after.  IFS enables minimal tuning for instruct tone without semantic drift. Overall, the work proposes decomposing instruct tuning into orthogonal tone alignment and knowledge acquisition to better control model training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Instruction Following Score (IFS), a metric to evaluate a language model's ability to follow instructions rather than just continue generating text. The IFS measures the ratio of "answer-like" responses to "continuation-like" responses when prompted with a set of instructions. A binary classifier is trained to categorize model responses as either following the instruction or not. 

The authors benchmark publicly available language models using IFS, showing a clear gap between base and instruct-tuned models. They also compute IFS during finetuning of LLaMA models, finding instruction following ability plateaus early in training. They propose an additional metric, ObjecQA, to contrast tone learning with acquisition of semantic knowledge. They find the main semantic shifts occur after models reach high IFS scores, implying format and knowledge infusion are separate stages. The work lays ground for better controlled and minimal impact instruct tuning to create interfaces querying foundation models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces the Instruction Following Score (IFS), a metric that detects language models' ability to follow instructions. The IFS is defined as the ratio of "answer-like" responses to "continuation-like" responses on a set of predefined instructions, as classified by a binary response tone classifier. 

To generate data to train the classifier, the authors split chat dataset pairs of (instruction, response) into different fragments representing complete instructions, partial instructions, continuations, and responses. The classifier is then trained to distinguish between "answer-like" and "continuation-like" responses.

The authors benchmark publicly available base and instruct models using IFS, showing it effectively distinguishes between the two classes. They also compute IFS during supervised finetuning of LLaMA models, finding instruction following ability plateaus early in training. To contrast this with semantic changes, they propose an auxiliary metric ObjecQA that measures model objectivity. They find the main semantic shifts occur after IFS plateaus, indicating format and content learning happen in distinct phases for the inspected models and features.

In summary, the main method is using the proposed IFS metric based on a binary response tone classifier to detect and analyze instruction following capabilities in language models. This enables insights into model tuning dynamics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on a quick skim of the paper, here is a one sentence summary: 

The paper introduces an Instruction Following Score (IFS) metric to evaluate language models' ability to respond conversationally to instructions, and uses it to analyze the learning dynamics during supervised finetuning of LLaMA models, finding distinct phases of formatting acquisition and semantic shifts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to evaluate whether a language model has been successfully "instruct-tuned" to behave more like a conversational agent that can follow instructions, rather than just predictively generating text. 

Some key questions they are exploring:

- How can you quantitatively measure a model's "instruction following" abilities, to distinguish base models from instruct models? They introduce a new metric called the Instruction Following Score (IFS) for this purpose.

- Can you use IFS as an early stopping criterion for minimal instruct tuning, to avoid excessive fine-tuning that could negatively impact the underlying semantics of the base model? 

- How do changes in tone/formatting (measured by IFS) compare to acquisition of knowledge (measured by a proposed auxiliary metric ObjecQA) over the course of instruct tuning? Are there distinct phases for "format infusion" vs "knowledge infusion"?

- Can you achieve good instruction following with simple prompt engineering, without extensive fine-tuning?

Overall, the authors aim to better understand and control the instruct tuning process, to balance gaining conversational abilities while minimizing negative semantic impacts on the foundation model. Their introduction of metrics like IFS represents an initial step towards this goal.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The Instruction Following Score (IFS) is introduced as a metric to determine a model's ability to follow instructions. How was the binary classifier for distinguishing "answer-like" vs "continuation-like" responses trained? What data was used and what metrics were optimized during training? How robust and generalizable is this classifier?

2. Fragmented instructions seem critical for distinguishing between base and instruct models using the IFS. What percentage of the instruction dataset consisted of fragmented vs complete instructions? Could the fragmentation algorithm potentially generate false positives by creating complete sentences labeled as fragments? How would this impact the IFS split and model evaluation?

3. The authors generate an instruction dataset and response dataset from the same source chat data. How are the datasets created - what defines the different inference inputs and outputs? How are the response tone labels (0 vs 1) assigned? Are there any caveats to this labeling approach? 

4. Prompt engineering with Alpaca and other wrappers is shown to significantly improve IFS. Was any multi-shot prompting attempted to further enhance the impact? Are certain models more "prompt-able" than others for instruction following? How close can prompting get base models to dedicated instruct models?

5. The ObjecQA metric is introduced to contrast tone learning and semantic/knowledge acquisition during SFT. What motivated the choice of objectivity as the semantic feature to track? Would other semantic factors exhibit the same disjoint learning phases with IFS plateau?

6. The instruction tuning capabilities of the inspected LMs plateau rapidly, enabling potential early stopping. Is minimal tuning sufficient for a chat interface queriable for pretraining knowledge? How can optimal stoppage criteria balance usability and retaining original capabilities?

7. The authors recommend future work on composable feature blocks for desired alignment without sacrifices. What are some hypothesized modular components that could achieve helpfulness, formality etc? How can interfaces be designed to leverage these for foundation model querying?

8. Only two model sizes were evaluated on a single dataset for SFT analysis. How would metrics evolve for larger models? Different data sources? Are findings expected to generalize? How could model and data variations reveal better insights?

9. All analysis relies on a subjective binary classifier for conversational tone. Could an unsupervised or self-supervised approach identify stylistic phases in SFT? Would such methods enable more standardized early stopping criteria?

10. Beyond SFT, how could techniques like reinforcement learning and human feedback also be evaluated to understand impact on model capabilities? The paper sets a direction, but many training paradigms warrant deeper investigation through a multifaceted lens.
