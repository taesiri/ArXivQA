# [LiDAR: Sensing Linear Probing Performance in Joint Embedding SSL   Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04000)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces LiDAR, a new metric to evaluate the quality of learned representations from joint embedding self-supervised learning methods without relying on downstream evaluation. LiDAR builds on the RankMe metric by modifying the feature covariance matrix used to calculate the rank. Specifically, LiDAR uses linear discriminant analysis between "clean" samples treated as surrogate classes to calculate a covariance matrix that focuses only on semantically meaningful and discriminative features. Through extensive experiments on multiple SSL methods like I-JEPA, data2vec, VICReg, SimCLR, and DINO, the authors demonstrate LiDAR has better correlation with downstream performance than RankMe. LiDAR also shows superior performance in selecting optimal hyperparameters and checkpoints. The method does have some limitations like higher computational cost compared to RankMe and possibility of negative correlation in some cases between LiDAR and downstream performance. Overall, LiDAR presents a promising approach to assess representation quality in SSL methods which can facilitate better model selection and design without requiring extensive downstream evaluation.
