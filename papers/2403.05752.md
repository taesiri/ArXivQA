## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides the updated LaTeX style files for 2021 for IEEE publications such as journals, conferences, letters and transactions. The style files define the structure and formatting of elements in the LaTeX documents such as sections, figures, theorems, citations and references to meet the requirements of IEEE publications.

Some of the key updates in this version include:

- Additional options for journal papers such as \texttt{review} option for double blind review and \texttt{preprint} option for preprints.

- Better support for special paper notices using the \texttt{IEEEspecialpapernotice} command.

- Additional column types for IEEEeqnarray environments.

- Improved spacing for theorems when in conference mode. 

- Support for arXiv notation for references.

- Many bug fixes.

The style files provide a convenient way for authors to prepare IEEE compliant manuscripts in LaTeX by defining logical markup for various elements of the document. By handling the visual styling and structure, the style files allow authors to focus on the content. These updated style files will make it easier for authors to submit and publish in IEEE publications.

The main contribution of this paper is the updated style files with bug fixes and additional features mentioned above to help authors, particularly the additional options related journal papers and support for new features like arXiv notation will be useful for many authors.
