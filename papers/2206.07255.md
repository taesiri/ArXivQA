# [GRAM-HD: 3D-Consistent Image Generation at High Resolution with   Generative Radiance Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07255)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-resolution, 3D-consistent images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained on unstructured 2D image collections? 

Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitation of previous 3D-aware GAN methods that cannot generate high-resolution images (e.g. 1024x1024) with strong 3D consistency when varying the viewpoint. This is due to either the high computational cost of volumetric rendering with neural radiance fields, or the use of 2D CNNs for image upsampling which breaks 3D consistency. 

To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a novel GAN approach called GRAM-HD that can achieve high-resolution, multiview consistent image generation. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage the generative radiance manifold (GRAM) representation to define a set of surface manifolds for efficient 3D scene representation and rendering. 

2) Apply 2D convolutions to upsample the radiance and features on these manifolds to super-resolve them while retaining 3D consistency.

3) Use dedicated adversarial and consistency losses to enable effective GAN training at high resolution.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining the GRAM representation with 2D super-resolution of radiance manifolds, the proposed GRAM-HD approach can achieve the new capability of high-resolution, 3D-consistent generative modeling from unstructured image collections. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability and compare to previous state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents GRAM-HD, a generative adversarial network (GAN) method for high-resolution 3D-consistent image generation. The main contributions are:

- It proposes a novel approach to achieve high-resolution image generation (up to 1024x1024) with strict 3D consistency using GANs trained on unstructured 2D image collections. 

- It introduces a manifold super-resolution module that leverages 2D CNNs to efficiently upsample radiance manifolds in 3D space. This allows super-resolution while preserving multiview consistency.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on FFHQ and AFHQ datasets, significantly outperforming recent 3D-aware GANs in terms of both image quality and consistency across views.

In summary, the key innovation is the radiance manifold super-resolution technique that enables GAN-based 3D-consistent high-resolution image synthesis. This opens the door for novel applications like high-quality 3D video generation and animation using generative models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel generative adversarial network called GRAM-HD that can generate high-resolution (up to 1024x1024), photorealistic, and 3D-consistent images of objects like faces by learning and upsampling radiance manifolds, outperforming prior work in image quality while retaining strong multiview consistency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work in 3D-aware image generation:

- The paper builds on the previous GRAM method that uses radiance manifolds for 3D-consistent image generation. Compared to vanilla NeRF-based GANs like Pi-GAN, GRAF, and HoloGAN, GRAM achieves better quality by focusing radiance field learning on surfaces. This paper inherits the manifold representation. 

- A main limitation of GRAM is that it can only generate low resolution images (up to 256x256) due to the cost of volumetric rendering. Many recent works use 2D CNNs to achieve higher resolution, including StyleNeRF, EG3D, StyleSDF, MVCGAN, etc. However, image-space upsampling with 2D CNNs sacrifices 3D consistency.

- This paper proposes to do super-resolution in object space by applying 2D convolutions on the radiance manifolds. This allows efficient high-res generation while maintaining consistency. The idea of object-space processing is novel compared to previous works.

- Experiments show the proposed method, GRAM-HD, achieves equal or higher image quality compared to StyleNeRF and StyleSDF, while having significantly better multiview consistency. It also outperforms GRAM at the same resolution.

- Limitations include difficulty in handling complex geometry, limited view extrapolation ability compared to dense 3D representations, and still lower quality than 2D GANs.

In summary, the key novelty of this paper is to perform super-resolution on radiance manifolds, which distinguishes it from other works and allows 3D-consistent high-res generation. The results demonstrate advantages over other recent methods in the same field.
