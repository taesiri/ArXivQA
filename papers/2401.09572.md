# [Handling Large-scale Cardinality in building recommendation systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recommendation systems need to capture user preferences and item features to provide accurate recommendations. This requires incorporating high-cardinality features like universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). 
- However, the exceptionally high cardinality of UUIDs causes issues like model degradation and increased model size due to sparsity.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a bag-of-words (BoW) approach to represent the user's behavior based on their previously ordered items. This acts as a proxy for the user's UUID.
- Share embedding table layers between the query and item towers of the two-tower embedding (TTE) model. This allows towers to exchange information about high cardinality features.

Key Contributions:
- BoW approach reduces model size by 25x and speeds up training. It is an efficient proxy for user behavior.
- Layer sharing further decreases model size and complexity. It also allows capturing of subtle relationships between queries and items.
- Combining BoW and layer sharing with other optimization techniques leads to 10% lift in Recall@500 and 30% increase at lower recall values.
- Faster convergence is achieved with 2000 steps to hit rate threshold compared to 20k for baseline BoW model.

In summary, the paper introduces innovative techniques like BoW and layer sharing that build on state-of-the-art methods to effectively handle high cardinality features in recommendation systems. This leads to gains in performance, efficiency and model size.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using a bag-of-words approach and layer sharing in two-tower embedding models to effectively handle high cardinality features like UUIDs in building more efficient large-scale recommendation systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing two innovative techniques - a bag-of-words approach and layer sharing - to address the challenge of high cardinality features like UUIDs in building recommendation systems. Specifically:

- The bag-of-words approach replaces the user UUID with a bag of the user's previously ordered stores. This serves as a proxy for the user and reduces dimensionality from hundreds of millions of users to millions of stores.

- Layer sharing involves enforcing embedding table-layer sharing for UUID features between the query and item towers of a two-tower embedding model. This allows the towers to share information and capture more nuanced relationships while also reducing parameters and model size. 

The paper shows through experiments that these techniques, used together, substantially improve performance metrics like hit rate and convergence speed compared to a baseline matrix factorization model. The methods also decrease model size by 25x. Overall, the techniques help optimize recommendation systems, particularly in the retrieval phase, to be more efficient and effective.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating innovative adaptations of existing techniques to handle high cardinality in recommendation systems. The proposed methods demonstrate the potential to inspire further research towards more performant recommendation systems.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a bag-of-words (BoW) approach to reduce the high cardinality of the eater_uuid feature. Can you explain in more detail how this BoW approach works and why it is effective at reducing cardinality? 

2. The layer sharing technique is introduced as an innovative approach in this paper. Can you explain the motivation behind using layer sharing and how it helps improve the model performance?

3. The paper compares the performance of the BoW model with and without layer sharing. What were the key differences noticed in terms of metrics like convergence speed and recall? Can you analyze the potential reasons behind these differences?

4. What modifications need to be made to the traditional two-tower embedding (TTE) models to enable sharing of embedding tables between the towers? What are the implementation challenges?

6. What were the key challenges faced with the baseline Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) model? How did the proposed techniques help mitigate those challenges?

7. The evaluation uses metrics like Hit Rate, NDCG and MAP. Can you explain what each of these metrics captures and why using multiple metrics provides a more comprehensive view? 

8. What could be the potential shortcomings of using a bag-of-words approach? In what cases might it fail to be an effective technique?

9. How can the ideas proposed in this paper be adapted and applied to other recommendation system use cases beyond Uber Eats? What components are most transferable?
