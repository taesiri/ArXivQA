## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Medical images like MRI scans are susceptible to noise and artifacts which greatly affect image quality and downstream analysis. Most existing methods are 2D-based which process MRI slices separately, losing important 3D anatomical information. Also, current pipelines treat image denoising and artifact correction as separate tasks without considering their potential relationships, leading to suboptimal results especially when severe noise and motion artifacts occur together.

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a Joint image Denoising and motion Artifact Correction (JDAC) framework that iteratively handles noisy MRIs with motion artifacts in 3D. JDAC has two key components - an adaptive denoising model and an anti-artifact model. 

The adaptive denoising model first estimates noise level using variance of gradient maps. It then uses a conditional UNet to reduce noise based on the estimated level. The anti-artifact model employs another UNet to remove motion artifacts, with a novel gradient-based loss to retain anatomical details.  

These two models are utilized iteratively through an early-stopping strategy, implicitly exploring relationships between the two tasks to progressively enhance image quality.

Main Contributions:

1) A joint denoising and artifact correction framework that iteratively processes 3D MRIs using two UNet-based models.

2) A noise level estimation method using variance of gradient maps to enable adaptive denoising.

3) A gradient-based loss function to preserve anatomical structures during motion correction.

4) Progressive quality improvement by implicitly relating the two tasks, especially for MRIs with both severe noise and artifacts.

5) Extensive validation on public datasets and a clinical study, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.
