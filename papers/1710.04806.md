# [Deep Learning for Case-Based Reasoning through Prototypes: A Neural   Network that Explains Its Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04806)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we create a deep neural network architecture that provides inherent interpretability and explanations for its predictions, while still maintaining high accuracy?The key points are:- Existing deep neural networks are often treated as "black boxes" and lack interpretability. This is problematic for trust and accountability.- The authors propose a new network architecture that contains an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a prototype layer that performs case-based reasoning. - The distance to learned prototypes provides explanations for predictions. The prototypes themselves are visualized through the decoder, providing inherent interpretability.- The training objective balances accuracy and interpretability through classification error, reconstruction error, and terms that connect prototypes to real observations.- Case studies on MNIST, cars, and Fashion MNIST show the model can provide interpretability while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard networks.In summary, the main hypothesis is that this architecture can provide inherent interpretability for deep networks through case-based reasoning with learned prototypes, without sacrificing much predictive accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel neural network architecture that provides inherent interpretability for its predictions. Specifically:- It introduces a prototype layer that computes distances between an input and a set of learned prototype vectors. These prototypes are encouraged to resemble real observations through additional regularization terms in the cost function. - By visualizing the prototypes and analyzing the learned weights connecting the prototype layer to the output layer, the model provides explanations for its predictions based on similarity of the input to prototypes of each class.- The autoencoder structure allows the model to learn useful features for comparing inputs and prototypes in a latent space, while also enabling visualization of the prototypes by decoding them.- Case studies on MNIST, a cars dataset, and Fashion MNIST demonstrate that the interpretable model can achieve competitive accuracy compared to non-interpretable networks, while also providing visualization and reasoning for its predictions.In summary, the key contribution is designing a network architecture that inherently provides model interpretability and explanations during the course of normal training, instead of needing post-hoc analysis or modification. The prototype-based reasoning process allows the model to explain predictions based on similarity to prototypical examples from the training set.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates prototype-based reasoning to provide natural interpretability and explainability for the model's predictions, without sacrificing much accuracy compared to non-interpretable models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on interpretable deep learning:- The main contribution of this paper is a novel neural network architecture that incorporates prototype-based reasoning to provide inherent interpretability. This is different from many other approaches that try to create post-hoc explanations for black-box neural networks. - The prototype layer and distance computation allows the model to provide natural case-based explanations about which examples it is similar to and different from. This aligns with research on prototype classification and case-based reasoning.- The autoencoder and decoder allow visualization of the learned prototypes, providing insight into what the model has learned. This is related to work using autoencoders for interpretability, but focused on the prototypes.- The cost function includes terms to encourage meaningful and faithful prototypes, unlike typical training objectives that just optimize accuracy. This builds interpretability into training.- Experiments show the architecture can achieve good accuracy without sacrificing much performance compared to non-interpretable models. So it balances accuracy and interpretability.- The approach is model-agnostic and could incorporate recent advances like attention or convolutional networks, unlike some model-specific interpretation methods.Overall, this paper provides a new way to make neural networks more interpretable by intrinsically incorporating prototype-based reasoning and visualization during training. The biggest differentiation is building interpretability directly into the model itself rather than trying to explain a black box after the fact.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests the following future research directions:- Exploring the extent to which interpretability reduces overfitting in deep learning models. The addition of the interpretability terms R1 and R2 act as regularizers and help prevent overfitting, but the authors suggest further analysis into this phenomenon. - Combining the interpretability approach in this paper with methods that identify relevant parts or segments of an input. The authors mention it may be possible to combine their method with approaches like LIME or activation maximization that focus on parts of images to get fine-grained interpretations.- Improving the classification accuracy further using more advanced techniques while retaining interpretability. The authors aimed for reasonable accuracy to demonstrate the architecture, but suggest more complex models may improve accuracy if needed.- Analyzing the decision boundaries induced by the prototypes and how they compare to other interpretable models like decision trees. The prototypes intuitively divide up the latent space, but formal analysis could provide more insight.- Extending the approach to other data types beyond images, such as text, audio, and time series data. The general framework should apply but may require some architecture modifications.- Exploring how faithfulness of explanations could be quantitatively evaluated, rather than just qualitatively.- Investigating how user trust changes when provided explanations from this interpretable architecture versus post-hoc methods.In summary, the main directions are improving classification accuracy, extending the approach to other data types and tasks, quantitatively evaluating the explanations, and comparing user trust with other interpretable methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture that provides built-in interpretability and explanation capability for its predictions. The network contains an autoencoder to learn a latent feature space and a prototype layer that stores prototype weight vectors resembling encoded training inputs. Distances to these learned prototypes in the latent space are used for classification. Two regularization terms encourage the prototypes to be close to actual training examples and spread out over the latent space. The autoencoder allows prototype vectors to be visualized as realistic inputs, providing interpretability. Without sacrificing accuracy, this architecture can trace the reasoning process for each prediction by identifying the most similar prototypes, demonstrating the predicted class relationships learned by the network through the prototype visualizations and connections. Case studies on image datasets MNIST, cars, and Fashion MNIST show the model achieves reasonable accuracy while providing interpretation of its predictions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture that provides interpretability by incorporating prototype-based reasoning into the model. The network contains an autoencoder, which maps the input data into a latent feature space, and a prototype layer that stores prototype weight vectors. Distances to these learned prototypes in the latent space are used for classification. Two regularization terms are added to the cost function to encourage the prototypes to resemble actual training examples, and to spread out to represent the whole latent space. The model is demonstrated on MNIST handwritten digits, a car angle dataset, and Fashion MNIST. For MNIST, the network learns meaningful prototypes that capture variations within and similarities between classes. The autoencoder provides good reconstructions, allowing visualization of prototypes. On cars, the model ignores color and identifies angle as the key feature, learning distinct prototypes for each angle class. Without the regularization terms, decoded prototypes become uninterpretable. The approach achieves accuracy comparable to standard convolutional networks, while providing interpretability. The prototypes give insight into the reasoning behind predictions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture for image classification that provides interpretability and explains its own reasoning process. The network contains an autoencoder to create a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images, and a prototype layer that stores prototype vectors corresponding to typical examples from each class. Distances between the encoded input and prototypes are used to make the classification. The network is trained to minimize a cost function with four terms: a classification error term, an autoencoder reconstruction error term, and two new terms that encourage each prototype to be close to a training example (for interpretability) and each training example to be close to some prototype (for faithfulness of explanations). The autoencoder allows visualizing the learned prototypes, and the prototype layer provides a natural way to explain predictions based on similarity to cases in the training set. This interpretable deep network achieves comparable accuracy to non-interpretable convolutional networks on image datasets.
