# [LLM can Achieve Self-Regulation via Hyperparameter Aware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 allow users to control the generated text by adjusting decoding strategies and hyperparameters. However, this is a manual and cumbersome process that requires extensive tuning based on task requirements. The key research questions explored are: Can LLMs realize the existence of decoding strategies and hyperparameters? And can LLMs regulate these decoding hyperparameters themselves?

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a novel framework called Hyperparameter Aware Generation (HAG) that allows LLMs to autonomously determine suitable decoding strategies and hyperparameters based on the input. It has two stages - first the model generates hyperparameters conditioned on the input, then it generates the response using the generated hyperparameters. This enables self-regulation without manual tuning.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce the HAG framework that enables LLMs to automatically adjust hyperparameters for varied inputs, eliminating extensive manual tuning.
- Construct a dataset to support supervised learning for self-regulation capability. 
- Comprehensive experiments on reasoning, creativity, translation and math tasks indicate LLMs can perceive decoding strategies and regulate hyperparameters. 
- HAG extends current paradigms for text generation, enabling more autonomous model behavior through self-regulation of decoding strategies.

In summary, this paper explores self-regulation capabilities of LLMs regarding decoding strategies through the proposed HAG framework. Experiments demonstrate enhanced performance and flexibility of LLMs to automatically modulate their own hyperparameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel text generation framework called Hyperparameter Aware Generation (HAG) that enables large language models to autonomously determine suitable decoding strategies and hyperparameters based on the input text, allowing for more self-regulated model behavior.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel text generation paradigm called Hyperparameter Aware Generation (HAG). This approach enables large language models (LLMs) to autonomously determine and adjust their own decoding hyperparameters based on the input, allowing for self-regulation of the decoding strategy and hyperparameters. 

2. It constructs a dataset to support supervised fine-tuning of the model to learn self-regulation, since no available training data exists with pairs of user queries and optimal model hyperparameters.

3. It conducts comprehensive experiments across reasoning, creativity, translation, and mathematics tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of HAG in empowering LLMs with self-regulation capabilities for improved text generation.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling LLMs to self-regulate their decoding process instead of relying solely on manual hyperparameter tuning. This paves the way for more autonomous and adaptive model behaviors.
