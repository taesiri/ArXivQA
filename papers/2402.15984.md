# [A unified Fourier slice method to derive ridgelet transform for a   variety of depth-2 neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The ridgelet transform is an integral transform that characterizes how parameters are distributed in a neural network. It provides valuable insights into understanding neural network parameters.
- However, closed-form expressions for the ridgelet transform are only known for a limited set of neural network architectures like fully-connected networks. For modern networks like convolutional, pooling layers etc the ridgelet transform is unknown.

Main Contribution:  
- This paper proposes a systematic "Fourier slice" method to derive ridgelet transforms for a variety of modern neural network architectures in a unified manner.

Proposed Method:
- Express the neural network architecture using Fourier basis/expressions instead of standard basis of neurons. 
- Introduce suitable change of variables to separate the Fourier expression into product of two factors - one containing the target function (to be approximated by network) and another factor that leads to the ridgelet transform solution.
- Obtain ridgelet transform by comparing Fourier coefficients.

Architectures Analyzed:
- Fully-connected networks on finite fields, group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert spaces, fully-connected networks on non-compact symmetric spaces, pooling layers

Outcomes:
- Closed-form ridgelet transforms derived for all the above modern NN architectures.  
- Provides constructive proof of universal approximation capabilities of these networks.
- Ridgelet analysis now expanded to much wider range of neural network architectures besides fully-connected networks.

To summarize, the paper develops a principled Fourier-slice method to derive closed-form ridgelet transforms for a variety of modern neural network architectures. This significantly expands the applicability of ridgelet analysis for providing valuable insights into properties of neural network parameters.
