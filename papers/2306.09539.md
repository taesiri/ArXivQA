# [Block-State Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09539)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we combine the complementary strengths of transformers and state space models into a single architecture for improved performance on long-range language modeling tasks?Specifically, the paper proposes a hybrid "Block-State Transformer" architecture that integrates:- A state space model (SSM) sublayer to provide efficient long-range context modeling and representation over very long sequences.- A local self-attention transformer sublayer (Block Transformer) to model short-term dependencies and relationships within blocks/windows of the sequence.The key hypothesis is that by integrating SSMs, which excel at long-range sequence processing, with transformers, which are strong at local context modeling, the resulting architecture can outperform pure transformers on long-range language modeling benchmarks. The Block-State Transformer aims to get the best of both approaches - leveraging SSMs to summarize long-range context and provide this to the Block Transformer's attention mechanism when modeling each local block. This hybrid approach is designed to be more efficient and scale better to longer sequences than pure transformers while retaining strong language modeling performance.In summary, the central question is whether combining the complementary strengths of SSMs and transformers can lead to improved performance on long-range language modeling tasks over using either approach alone. The paper proposes and evaluates the Block-State Transformer architecture to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems like the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new hybrid layer called Block-State Transformer (BST) that combines State Space Models (SSMs) and Block Transformers. Some key points on the contribution:- SSMs are good at modeling long-range dependencies efficiently but struggle on language modeling tasks. Transformers are the opposite - great on language modeling but don't scale well to long sequences.- The BST layer combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization with a Block Transformer sublayer for local representation.- This allows the model to handle long input sequences efficiently while still using attention for language modeling. - They propose and evaluate 3 variants (Single-Head, Multi-Head, Multi-Filter) for integrating the SSM states into the Block Transformer's attention.- Experiments show BST outperforms comparable baselines on perplexity while being over 10x faster due to parallelization.- BST also generalizes better to longer sequences than it was trained on compared to baselines.So in summary, the key contribution is proposing BST, a novel and efficient layer that combines the strengths of SSMs and Transformers for improved language modeling on long sequences. The variants and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
