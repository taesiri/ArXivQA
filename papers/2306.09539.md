# [Block-State Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09539)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we combine the complementary strengths of transformers and state space models into a single architecture for improved performance on long-range language modeling tasks?Specifically, the paper proposes a hybrid "Block-State Transformer" architecture that integrates:- A state space model (SSM) sublayer to provide efficient long-range context modeling and representation over very long sequences.- A local self-attention transformer sublayer (Block Transformer) to model short-term dependencies and relationships within blocks/windows of the sequence.The key hypothesis is that by integrating SSMs, which excel at long-range sequence processing, with transformers, which are strong at local context modeling, the resulting architecture can outperform pure transformers on long-range language modeling benchmarks. The Block-State Transformer aims to get the best of both approaches - leveraging SSMs to summarize long-range context and provide this to the Block Transformer's attention mechanism when modeling each local block. This hybrid approach is designed to be more efficient and scale better to longer sequences than pure transformers while retaining strong language modeling performance.In summary, the central question is whether combining the complementary strengths of SSMs and transformers can lead to improved performance on long-range language modeling tasks over using either approach alone. The paper proposes and evaluates the Block-State Transformer architecture to test this hypothesis.
