# [Multiple Disciplinary Data Work Practices in Artificial Intelligence   Research: a Healthcare Case Study in the UK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18424)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed one-paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper explores how multiple disciplinarity (defined as bringing a variety of disciplines together to work on a complex issue) can lead to complex collaborative dynamics and impacts on work practices in the context of the development of AI tools in healthcare. It discusses findings from 13 semi-structured interviews with members of research consortia in the UK focused on applying machine learning to electronic health records (EHRs) to help treat people with multiple long term conditions. The consortia involve collaborations between data scientists, clinicians, epidemiologists, and patient representatives. The results reveal four key themes: (1) Meetings act as a central platform for exchanges between disciplines, allowing the blending and creation of new cross-disciplinary knowledge. (2) Restrictions on accessing sensitive EHR datasets impact all collaborative activity from analysis to communication. (3) Traditional data science tools like Jupyter notebooks are insufficient for diverse teams. (4) Involving patients brings an important but challenging real-world perspective, requiring researchers to adapt communication and data sharing. Overall, the paper highlights key tensions in collaborative AI development for healthcare. It suggests design improvements for analysis and communication tools to better support multiple disciplinary teams working with sensitive data, including facilitating real-time data exploration, using synthetic datasets, and improving automated reporting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper explores how multiple disciplinary collaboration impacts artificial intelligence development practices in healthcare, finding that data restrictions, communication channels like meetings, and perspectives from patients shape workflows and tool choices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper explores how multiple disciplinarity (bringing together researchers from different academic disciplines as well as clinicians and patients) impacts work practices and collaboration in the context of developing AI tools for healthcare. Through interviews with members of large UK research consortia working on AI and health, the authors identify key themes around how the need to communicate and share knowledge across disciplines shapes practices related to data analysis, tool use, meeting structures, and more. 

Specific key findings highlighted in the paper include:

- Meetings are a vital platform for exchange and blending of knowledge between disciplines
- Restrictions around health data sets significantly impact collaboration activities
- Traditional data science tools like Jupyter Notebooks are not sufficient for highly diverse collaborative teams
- Involving patient voices/perspectives introduces distinct challenges compared to including other disciplines

Overall, the paper provides an in-depth look at the collaborative dynamics and tensions that arise in large, multi-disciplinary teams working on AI in the healthcare setting. It offers implications for better supporting this type of research through adapted tools and practices.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses using semi-structured interviews to explore the dynamics of multiple disciplinary work. What considerations went into designing the interview guide and what steps were taken to validate it before use?

2. What specific sampling techniques were used to recruit the 13 participants across the 7 research consortia? Why was purposive sampling chosen for this study?

3. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview transcripts. Can you walk through the specific stages of the analysis? What steps were taken to promote validity and rigor? 

4. Why was the term "multiple disciplinarity" chosen as the lens for this research instead of more common terms like "interdisciplinary" or "multidisciplinary"? What are the key differences between these terms?

5. What role did the researchers play during the interviews? How might their backgrounds, perspectives, or positions have influenced the responses? 

6. What ethical considerations existed in this study beyond informed consent? How were issues around privacy, data management, and other ethical issues addressed?

7. The paper identifies meetings as a key platform for exchange between disciplines. What specific meeting structures facilitated this exchange? What other factors promote effective exchange?

8. Data restrictions posed challenges throughout the workflow in these projects. Beyond using synthetic datasets, what other potential solutions could address these data restrictions?

9. The paper discusses discipline-specific languages and communication barriers. What steps could researchers take to build a shared vocabulary across disciplines over time?

10. This research explores multiple disciplinarity in large consortia focused on AI development in healthcare. How might the findings differ in other collaborative settings or projects with different aims?
