# [HumanBench: Towards General Human-centric Perception with Projector   Assisted Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05675)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is: whether a general human-centric pretraining model can be developed that can benefit diverse human-centric downstream tasks and be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes building a general pretraining model that can handle a variety of human-centric vision tasks like person re-identification, pose estimation, human parsing, etc. 

- Most prior work focuses on task-specific models which can be inefficient. The goal is to develop a general model that can work across tasks.

- The paper introduces a benchmark called HumanBench to evaluate pretraining methods on diverse human-centric tasks. 

- It also proposes a pretraining method called PATH that uses a projector-assisted hierarchical weight sharing approach to handle the diversity of tasks and annotation granularities.

- Experiments on HumanBench show PATH achieves SOTA results on most tasks, demonstrating its ability to learn transferable representations for human-centric perception.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a general human-centric pretraining model can be developed using the proposed methods to efficiently handle diverse downstream tasks, which is evaluated via the HumanBench benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new benchmark called HumanBench for evaluating pretraining methods on human-centric computer vision tasks. HumanBench contains a diverse set of images and comprehensive evaluations on 19 datasets across 6 tasks: person re-identification, pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian attribute recognition, pedestrian detection, and crowd counting. 

2. Proposing a novel pretraining method called PATH (Projector AssisTed Hierarchical pretraining) to learn both coarse and fine-grained features of human bodies from diverse datasets and annotation granularities. PATH uses a hierarchical weight sharing strategy with task-specific projectors to reduce conflicts when pretraining on diverse datasets and tasks.

3. Achieving state-of-the-art results on most datasets in HumanBench using PATH pretraining, showing the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark and pretraining method. For example, PATH improves human parsing by 2.5-3.6% mIoU, person re-identification by 4.9-8.1% mAP, and pose estimation by 1.2-3.0% AP over previous state-of-the-art methods.

4. Demonstrating that pretraining on human-centric datasets is more effective than pretraining on natural images for downstream human-centric tasks. The proposed PATH also outperforms generic self-supervised methods like MAE and MOCOv3 when pretrained and evaluated on HumanBench.

In summary, the key contributions are the new HumanBench benchmark for human-centric vision, the PATH pretraining method to handle diverse human-centric data, and superior results on HumanBench showing the effectiveness of the approach. The work sheds light on pretraining representations tailored for human perception tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called HumanBench for evaluating human-centric visual perception models, and a supervised pretraining method called PATH that uses task-specific projectors and hierarchical weight sharing to learn multi-scale features from diverse human-centric datasets and annotations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in human-centric perception:

- The key contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new benchmark called HumanBench for evaluating human-centric perception models across multiple tasks. Other recent benchmarks like OmniBench focus more broadly on general vision tasks, while HumanBench specifically targets human-centric tasks. 

- The paper also proposes a new pretraining method called PATH that is tailored for human-centric perception. This differentiates it from more general pretraining methods like MAE and CLIP which are not designed specifically for human understanding.

- The variety of human-centric tasks covered by HumanBench is quite comprehensive, including ReID, pose, parsing, attributes, detection and counting. Many prior works focus on 1-2 tasks, while this provides a unified benchmark for evaluating across diverse tasks.

- By reporting systematic comparisons using HumanBench, the paper shows the limitations of existing general methods like MAE and CLIP for human tasks. It also demonstrates the benefits of using human-centric data and objectives during pretraining.

- The proposed PATH method follows recent trends on improving supervised pretraining by using task-specific projectors and hierarchical weight sharing. The novelty is in the application of these techniques for diverse human tasks.

- The results show PATH achieves new SOTA on the majority of HumanBench tasks, demonstrating the usefulness of human-centric pretraining. The gains are especially significant on newer datasets not used during pretraining.

Overall, the paper makes nice contributions in terms of benchmarking methodology and introducing pretraining techniques tailored for human understanding. The comprehensive empirical study on HumanBench is a valuable resource for future research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing unified network structures for human-centric pretraining. The current approach uses separate components like the backbone, projectors, and heads, but exploring end-to-end unified architectures could be beneficial. 

- Incorporating 3D human modeling tasks into the pretraining. The current HumanBench focuses on 2D image tasks, but expanding to 3D modeling tasks like human mesh reconstruction could enrich the learned representations.

- Exploring different pretraining approaches beyond supervised pretraining. While PATH uses supervised pretraining, self-supervised and semi-supervised approaches could also be promising directions.

- Scaling up the model size. The paper shows promising results when scaling up from ViT-Base to ViT-Large, suggesting further gains could be achieved with even larger models.

- Expanding the diversity of data for pretraining. Adding more datasets, tasks, domains, and modalities could continue to improve the generalization of the pretraining.

- Studying what knowledge is gained during pretraining. Analyzing what is specifically learned by the model could provide insights for further improving human-centric pretraining.

- Applications to embodied AI tasks like human-robot interaction. The human-centric representations could potentially transfer to tasks involving perceiving and interacting with humans.

So in summary, some of the key future directions are developing unified architectures, incorporating 3D/multimodal data, scaling up, expanding pretraining data diversity, analyzing learned knowledge, and applying to embodied AI problems. The paper lays a solid foundation for general human-centric pretraining, but there are still many interesting avenues for extending this work further.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new benchmark called HumanBench for evaluating general human-centric pretraining models on diverse human-centric perception tasks. HumanBench contains 11 million images across 37 datasets spanning tasks like person re-identification, pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian attribute recognition, and pedestrian detection. It evaluates models on 12 seen datasets from pretraining, 5 unseen datasets, and 2 unseen tasks to comprehensively measure generalization ability. 

The paper also proposes a supervised pretraining method called PATH (Projector Assisted Hierarchical Pretraining) to learn from the diverse HumanBench datasets. PATH uses a hierarchical weight sharing strategy with a shared backbone, task-specific projectors, and dataset-specific heads to reduce conflicts between different tasks and datasets. Experiments show PATH achieves state-of-the-art results on most HumanBench tasks, outperforming prior self-supervised and multi-modal pretraining methods. The benchmark and pretraining method aim to advance research on learning general human-centric visual representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new pretraining method called PATH (Projector Assisted Hierarchical pretraining) to learn general human-centric representations that can transfer to various downstream tasks. PATH uses a hierarchical weight sharing strategy where the backbone parameters are shared across all datasets, the projector parameters are shared only across datasets of the same task, and the head parameters are not shared. A lightweight projector module composed of attention and gating modules is inserted between the backbone and heads to attend to task-specific features. This hierarchical sharing enforces the backbone to learn general features, the projector to focus on task-specific features, and the heads to specialize for each dataset. The projectors are discarded after pretraining, and only the backbone is used for downstream tasks to evaluate its transferability. Experiments on the proposed HumanBench benchmark with 19 datasets across 6 tasks show PATH achieves state-of-the-art results on most datasets, demonstrating its ability to learn generalized human-centric representations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 According to my understanding, this paper addresses the problem of lacking a general pretraining model and benchmark for human-centric perception tasks. The key issues it tries to tackle are:

1. The lack of a benchmark to fairly compare various pretraining methods for a broad range of human-centric tasks, data distributions, and application scenarios. 

2. The difficulty of pretraining a general human-centric model that can learn both global (e.g. person ReID) and fine-grained local (e.g. pose estimation) features simultaneously from diverse annotation granularities.

To address these issues, the paper proposes:

1. A benchmark called HumanBench for pretraining and evaluating generalization ability of models on human-centric tasks. It contains diverse images and comprehensive evaluations on 19 datasets across 6 tasks.

2. A pretraining method called PATH that uses projectors and hierarchical weight sharing to learn multi-granularity features from diverse annotations. It achieves SOTA results on most datasets in HumanBench.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a benchmark and pretraining method to advance research on general human-centric perception models that can benefit diverse downstream applications. The proposed solutions aim to address the lack of unified platforms for comparison and the challenges in pretraining models that handle diversity in human-centric tasks.
