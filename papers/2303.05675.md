# [HumanBench: Towards General Human-centric Perception with Projector   Assisted Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05675)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is: whether a general human-centric pretraining model can be developed that can benefit diverse human-centric downstream tasks and be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes building a general pretraining model that can handle a variety of human-centric vision tasks like person re-identification, pose estimation, human parsing, etc. 

- Most prior work focuses on task-specific models which can be inefficient. The goal is to develop a general model that can work across tasks.

- The paper introduces a benchmark called HumanBench to evaluate pretraining methods on diverse human-centric tasks. 

- It also proposes a pretraining method called PATH that uses a projector-assisted hierarchical weight sharing approach to handle the diversity of tasks and annotation granularities.

- Experiments on HumanBench show PATH achieves SOTA results on most tasks, demonstrating its ability to learn transferable representations for human-centric perception.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a general human-centric pretraining model can be developed using the proposed methods to efficiently handle diverse downstream tasks, which is evaluated via the HumanBench benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new benchmark called HumanBench for evaluating pretraining methods on human-centric computer vision tasks. HumanBench contains a diverse set of images and comprehensive evaluations on 19 datasets across 6 tasks: person re-identification, pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian attribute recognition, pedestrian detection, and crowd counting. 

2. Proposing a novel pretraining method called PATH (Projector AssisTed Hierarchical pretraining) to learn both coarse and fine-grained features of human bodies from diverse datasets and annotation granularities. PATH uses a hierarchical weight sharing strategy with task-specific projectors to reduce conflicts when pretraining on diverse datasets and tasks.

3. Achieving state-of-the-art results on most datasets in HumanBench using PATH pretraining, showing the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark and pretraining method. For example, PATH improves human parsing by 2.5-3.6% mIoU, person re-identification by 4.9-8.1% mAP, and pose estimation by 1.2-3.0% AP over previous state-of-the-art methods.

4. Demonstrating that pretraining on human-centric datasets is more effective than pretraining on natural images for downstream human-centric tasks. The proposed PATH also outperforms generic self-supervised methods like MAE and MOCOv3 when pretrained and evaluated on HumanBench.

In summary, the key contributions are the new HumanBench benchmark for human-centric vision, the PATH pretraining method to handle diverse human-centric data, and superior results on HumanBench showing the effectiveness of the approach. The work sheds light on pretraining representations tailored for human perception tasks.
