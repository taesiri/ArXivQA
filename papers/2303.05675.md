# [HumanBench: Towards General Human-centric Perception with Projector   Assisted Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05675)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is: whether a general human-centric pretraining model can be developed that can benefit diverse human-centric downstream tasks and be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes building a general pretraining model that can handle a variety of human-centric vision tasks like person re-identification, pose estimation, human parsing, etc. 

- Most prior work focuses on task-specific models which can be inefficient. The goal is to develop a general model that can work across tasks.

- The paper introduces a benchmark called HumanBench to evaluate pretraining methods on diverse human-centric tasks. 

- It also proposes a pretraining method called PATH that uses a projector-assisted hierarchical weight sharing approach to handle the diversity of tasks and annotation granularities.

- Experiments on HumanBench show PATH achieves SOTA results on most tasks, demonstrating its ability to learn transferable representations for human-centric perception.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a general human-centric pretraining model can be developed using the proposed methods to efficiently handle diverse downstream tasks, which is evaluated via the HumanBench benchmark.
