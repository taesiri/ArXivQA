# [Autonomous Intersection Management for Non-Communicative Autonomous   Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17681)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel decentralized framework for autonomous intersection management of non-communicating vehicles. The key goal is to maximize intersection throughput at unsignalized intersections with low to medium traffic density, without relying on any infrastructure or inter-vehicle communication. The core idea involves utilizing a harmony matrix to model permissible vehicle movement combinations and formulating a maximum clique problem to identify the optimal set of non-conflicting vehicles to traverse the intersection simultaneously. Extensive simulations compare the algorithmâ€™s performance against fixed-time signals, adaptive signals, and a communicative approach, evaluating waiting times and travel times. Results demonstrate superior performance over non-communicative methods and comparable outcomes to communicative techniques for balanced and unbalanced traffic conditions across 3-way, 4-way and 5-way junctions. The decentralized approach provides a cost-effective, infrastructure-less solution to optimize intersection traversal. Key assumptions include vehicle intent communication, lane priorities and color codes. Future work involves accommodating human-driven vehicles through rule-based methods and intent prediction. Overall, this paper makes notable contributions in efficient unsignalized intersection management for autonomous vehicles.

The paper proposes a decentralized intersection management algorithm for autonomous vehicles to navigate unsignalized intersections without relying on infrastructure or inter-vehicle communication by constructing a harmony matrix graph and finding the maximal clique that maximizes intersection throughput.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel decentralized intersection management algorithm for autonomous vehicles to navigate unsignalized intersections with low to medium traffic density. The key aspects of the algorithm are:

- It enables autonomous vehicles to coordinate and maximize throughput at intersections without relying on any infrastructure like traffic signals or dedicated communication protocols like V2V/V2I. 

- It formulates the problem as a maximal clique problem on a graph constructed using a harmony matrix, which encodes conflicting and non-conflicting vehicle movements. Solving the maximal clique provides the optimal combination of vehicles that can cross simultaneously.

- It incorporates mechanisms like speed reduction zones and lane priorities to ensure deadlock-free and safe navigation across intersections. 

- Extensive simulations demonstrate that the algorithm performs better than fixed-time and adaptive traffic signals and provides comparable results to a communicative method, especially under unbalanced traffic conditions.

- The algorithm is versatile and can be extended to intersections with any number of roads by modifying the harmony matrix. Results are presented for 3-way, 4-way and 5-way intersections.

In summary, the key contribution is a decentralized, infrastructure-less algorithm for autonomous intersection management that attempts to maximize throughput while ensuring safety.
