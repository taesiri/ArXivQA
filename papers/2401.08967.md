# [ReFT: Reasoning with Reinforced Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08967)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models on math problem solving tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations shows limited generalization ability. This is because usually there is only one annotated reasoning path per question in the training data.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance generalization ability.

- ReFT first warms up the model using standard SFT for one or two epochs.

- Then, ReFT uses the PPO reinforcement learning algorithm to further fine-tune the model. During this stage, multiple reasoning paths are sampled from the model policy for each question. The rewards are naturally derived from comparing the extracted answers to the ground truth answers.

Main Contributions:

- ReFT significantly outperforms SFT across three math datasets (GSM8K, MathQA, SVAMP), using two foundation models (CodeLLAMA, Galactica). The improved performance demonstrates superior generalization ability of ReFT over SFT.

- Experiments show combining ReFT with inference-time techniques like majority voting and reward model reranking can further boost performance.

- ReFT achieves the improved performance by better exploiting the existing training data, without relying on extra annotated data.

- Analysis reveals ReFT surpasses SFT after around 30 epochs of training, indicating the benefits of reinforcement learning based exploration.

In summary, the paper introduces a simple yet effective reinforced fine-tuning approach for math problem solving. By adopting reinforcement learning to sample multiple reasoning paths, ReFT greatly enhances generalization over standard supervised fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) that combines supervised pre-training and reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning and generalization abilities of large language models for solving math problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It introduces a novel fine-tuning approach called reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT) which utilizes reinforcement learning to solve math problems. ReFT shows better performance and generalization ability compared to conventional supervised fine-tuning.

2. It conducts extensive experiments on three datasets using two foundation models. The experiments demonstrate that ReFT significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning and other self-training baselines in terms of accuracy.

3. It shows that models trained with ReFT can further benefit from techniques like majority voting and reward model reranking, achieving state-of-the-art results on the GSM8K dataset among comparable model sizes.

4. The approach does not rely on extra training data and manages to improve performance by better exploiting the potential of existing training data. This highlights the effectiveness of using reinforcement learning for fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing ReFT as a new way to fine-tune language models for math problem solving, which is shown to be superior to supervised fine-tuning through comprehensive experimentation. The key ideas are using reinforcement learning to explore multiple reasoning paths and better utilize the available training data.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) - The proposed method to enhance model generalization for reasoning tasks by combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) - Annotations that outline intermediate reasoning steps for solving problems like math word problems. 

- Math problem solving - The paper focuses on using ReFT to improve performance on math problem datasets like GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP.

- Generalization ability - A key capability ReFT aims to improve over standard supervised fine-tuning. ReFT explores multiple reasoning paths to learn more robustly. 

- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - The reinforcement learning algorithm specifically used to implement ReFT.

- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - The conventional fine-tuning approach that relies on annotated training data. ReFT starts with SFT before the RL stage.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the warm-up stage in ReFT help initialize the policy network before reinforcement learning? What would happen if you skipped the warm-up stage?

2) Explain the difference between the supervised loss function used in warm-up (Eq. 1) versus the reinforcement learning loss function (Eq. 2). Why can't you just use the supervised loss for the whole training?  

3) What is the motivation behind using PPO specifically as the reinforcement learning algorithm? How does PPO help prevent instability during policy exploration?

4) Explain the formulation of the advantage estimate (A_t) and justify the use of the generalized advantage estimate. How does this connect to the policy and value loss functions?

5) What is the effect of using a partial reward for non-terminal states during RL training? How does this reward shaping technique alleviate challenges around sparse rewards? 

6) How does the added KL divergence term in the reward function constrain policy updates to prevent diverging too far from the initial policy? What were the results when you removed the KL regularization?

7) Compare and contrast between the explored state space under supervised fine-tuning versus reinforced fine-tuning. How does RL enable visiting more state-action trajectories? 

8) Why does the ReFT method exhibit better generalization performance compared to supervised approaches when evaluated on the test set? Connect this observation to the theory of generalization in RL.

9) Discuss the limitations around efficiency and sample complexity for reinforcement learning techniques compared to supervised learning. Are there any methods to help mitigate these downsides?

10) Beyond math problem solving, what other application domains could benefit from using a ReFT approach? What considerations around reward formulation would come into play?
