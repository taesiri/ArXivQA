# [Enhancing Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models   through Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13339)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can principles from symbolic logic be leveraged to enhance the zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning capability of large language models?The key points are:- Large language models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities but still struggle with coherent, multi-step reasoning. Their reasoning processes are often unconstrained and can lead to hallucinations or logical inconsistencies. - The authors propose incorporating concepts from symbolic logic to help construct a more systematic, "causal" reasoning framework for LLMs. This involves verifying each step of reasoning using the principle of "reductio ad absurdum" to check for contradictions.- They introduce Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT), which guides the LLM to "think-verify-revise" when generating a reasoning chain. Steps that fail verification are revised before proceeding.- Experiments across diverse language tasks demonstrate that LogiCoT enhances the zero-shot reasoning performance of LLMs compared to just using chain-of-thought prompting alone.In summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating logic-based verification and revision techniques will improve the coherence and validity of LLM reasoning in a zero-shot setting. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed LogiCoT framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal and evaluation of LogiCoT, a neurosymbolic framework that aims to improve the zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning ability of large language models. Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution seem to be:- Motivated by principles from symbolic logic, LogiCoT incorporates a "think-verify-revise" framework to guide the reasoning process of LLMs. This involves generating an initial chain of thoughts, verifying each step through comparison of opposing explanations, and revising any steps that fail verification before adapting the remaining chain. - The verification procedure is inspired by the logic technique of "reductio ad absurdum", where an initial assumption is made and then a contradiction is derived to disprove it. Here, they prompt the LLM to generate positive and negative explanations for each reasoning step, and identify contradictions.- The overall framework integrates concepts from neurosymbolic AI to take advantage of both the reasoning capacity of neural networks and the structure/transparency of symbolic logic representations.- Experiments across diverse language reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, causal, etc.) demonstrate improved performance of LLMs enhanced with LogiCoT compared to a baseline CoT approach. Benefits are shown with different model sizes, with higher gains for larger models like GPT-4.- Analysis explores the impact of the verification and revision stages, showing the transition from "composing" to "adopting" explanations improves error detection, and highlighting cases where reasoning chains are successfully corrected.In summary, the key contribution is presenting LogiCoT to logically enhance chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs through a neurosymbolic framework of guided verification and revision. The approach is evaluated across language domains and models to demonstrate its benefits.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes LogiCoT, a neurosymbolic framework that leverages principles from symbolic logic to verify and revise the reasoning processes of large language models in order to enhance their zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning ability across diverse domains like arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic, causal, and social reasoning.
