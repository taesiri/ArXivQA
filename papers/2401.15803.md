## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Comprehensive testing is essential for developing autonomous vehicles, but conducting real-world testing can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Simulation provides a viable alternative, but availability of open-source simulators is limited. Existing simulators also have shortcomings in terms of realism, customizability, and ease of use. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors present GarchingSim, a new open-source autonomous driving simulator built on the Unity game engine. The simulator features photorealistic 3D urban environments modeled after real cities. It incorporates precise vehicle dynamics and sensor models (cameras, radar, IMU, GNSS) for an authentic driving experience. The traffic system includes traffic lights, signs, and waypoint-based agents. 

GarchingSim enables communication with external algorithms via ROS2 or Socket.IO interfaces. This allows integration with existing software stacks. It supports generating synthetic data and testing algorithms based on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

The authors emphasize ease of deployment, providing executable simplified and customizable developer versions. The simulator is compatible with Windows and Linux.

Main Contributions:
- Photorealistic urban driving environments for high simulation fidelity
