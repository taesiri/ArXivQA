# [Path Planning based on 2D Object Bounding-box](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement: 
Implementing autonomous driving in complex urban environments presents major challenges for perception systems and motion planning algorithms. While end-to-end methods using LiDAR sensors have shown promise, they have drawbacks related to cost, safety, and robustness that may hinder widespread deployment. The paper argues that vision-centric autonomous driving using cameras offers a promising alternative.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a lightweight vision-centric autonomous driving system using:
1) YOLOv8 for bounding box object detection and tracking from surround-view cameras. This handles the perception task.
2) An attention-based graph neural network (GNN) that ingests perception outputs, HD maps, and ego vehicle sensor data and predicts a safe trajectory represented as future waypoints. This handles the planning task.  

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a streamlined vision-centric model for urban autonomous driving that balances performance and simplicity.
- Models the interplay between visual perception, HD semantic maps, and dynamic vehicular data for enhanced environmental context.  
- Implements local and global feature embedding via GNN to aggregate spatial-temporal information for trajectory prediction.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the nuPlan challenge benchmark, setting a new bar for vision-centric autonomy.

In summary, the paper puts forth a lightweight vision-based system for challenging urban driving scenarios. By fusing multi-modal sensory data and leveraging deep neural networks for end-to-end decision making, their approach aims to effectively mimic human driving behaviors for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.
