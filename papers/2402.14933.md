# [Path Planning based on 2D Object Bounding-box](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement: 
Implementing autonomous driving in complex urban environments presents major challenges for perception systems and motion planning algorithms. While end-to-end methods using LiDAR sensors have shown promise, they have drawbacks related to cost, safety, and robustness that may hinder widespread deployment. The paper argues that vision-centric autonomous driving using cameras offers a promising alternative.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a lightweight vision-centric autonomous driving system using:
1) YOLOv8 for bounding box object detection and tracking from surround-view cameras. This handles the perception task.
2) An attention-based graph neural network (GNN) that ingests perception outputs, HD maps, and ego vehicle sensor data and predicts a safe trajectory represented as future waypoints. This handles the planning task.  

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a streamlined vision-centric model for urban autonomous driving that balances performance and simplicity.
- Models the interplay between visual perception, HD semantic maps, and dynamic vehicular data for enhanced environmental context.  
- Implements local and global feature embedding via GNN to aggregate spatial-temporal information for trajectory prediction.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the nuPlan challenge benchmark, setting a new bar for vision-centric autonomy.

In summary, the paper puts forth a lightweight vision-based system for challenging urban driving scenarios. By fusing multi-modal sensory data and leveraging deep neural networks for end-to-end decision making, their approach aims to effectively mimic human driving behaviors for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.

In summary, the paper puts forth a streamlined autonomous driving system that can leverage spatial and temporal information from cameras, maps, and sensors to generate trajectories and waypoints for navigation in complex urban settings. The main innovation seems to be the dual embedding strategy combined with the attention-based graph neural network to enable responsive and human-like driving behavior.
