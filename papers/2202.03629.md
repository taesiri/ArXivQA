## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Development of more fine-grained hallucination metrics that can distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations, and identify the specific hallucinated substrings within a generated text. They suggest incorporating more cognitive and human perspective into metrics to better align with human judgments. 

- More research into detecting and mitigating extrinsic hallucinations by incorporating external world knowledge and fact checking methods. This is more challenging than intrinsic hallucination but important for improving faithfulness.

- Exploring controllable generation methods that can balance between faithfulness and diversity/engagement based on different real-world application needs. More annotated datasets may be needed for this.

- Development of more generalizable data preprocessing techniques to reduce hallucination that can work across different NLG tasks and data types. Current techniques are still quite task-specific.

- Addition of reasoning abilities, especially numerical reasoning, to models to improve logical fact understanding and inference, reducing hallucinations from misunderstandings.

- Handling long input/output sequences better to reduce self-contradictions and improve memorization, especially for tasks like dialogue and question answering. Architectures like the Longformer could help.

- More analysis and mitigation methods for emerging NLG areas like generative question answering and vision-language tasks where hallucination research is still in early stages.

- Exploration of ground-truth free evaluation metrics that do not require reference texts, since one input can have multiple valid outputs in NLG.

- Improving efficiency, robustness and interpretability of existing hallucination detection algorithms.

In summary, the key directions are developing better evaluation metrics, mitigation methods generalized across tasks, and tackling new NLG frontiers like vision-language and open-ended generation.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper presents an abstractive summarization approach based on a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. The authors propose a dual-stage attention mechanism that incorporates both word- and sentence-level attention. In the first stage, a word-level attention distribution is calculated to attend to the words in the source document. This helps the model focus on the relevant words when generating each word in the summary. In the second stage, a sentence-level attention distribution is calculated to determine the sentences in the source document that are most relevant to generating the current summary sentence. This two-stage attention allows the model to dynamically combine both fine-grained word-level and high-level sentence-level attention when generating the summary. The authors show that this dual attention mechanism improves summarization performance over standard sequence-to-sequence models with only word-level attention.
