## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Development of more fine-grained hallucination metrics that can distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations, and identify the specific hallucinated substrings within a generated text. They suggest incorporating more cognitive and human perspective into metrics to better align with human judgments. - More research into detecting and mitigating extrinsic hallucinations by incorporating external world knowledge and fact checking methods. This is more challenging than intrinsic hallucination but important for improving faithfulness.- Exploring controllable generation methods that can balance between faithfulness and diversity/engagement based on different real-world application needs. More annotated datasets may be needed for this.- Development of more generalizable data preprocessing techniques to reduce hallucination that can work across different NLG tasks and data types. Current techniques are still quite task-specific.- Addition of reasoning abilities, especially numerical reasoning, to models to improve logical fact understanding and inference, reducing hallucinations from misunderstandings.- Handling long input/output sequences better to reduce self-contradictions and improve memorization, especially for tasks like dialogue and question answering. Architectures like the Longformer could help.- More analysis and mitigation methods for emerging NLG areas like generative question answering and vision-language tasks where hallucination research is still in early stages.- Exploration of ground-truth free evaluation metrics that do not require reference texts, since one input can have multiple valid outputs in NLG.- Improving efficiency, robustness and interpretability of existing hallucination detection algorithms.In summary, the key directions are developing better evaluation metrics, mitigation methods generalized across tasks, and tackling new NLG frontiers like vision-language and open-ended generation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a survey of research on hallucination in natural language generation (NLG). The first paragraph summarizes the key points as follows. Recent advances in deep learning have led to great improvements in NLG tasks like summarization and translation. However, neural NLG models tend to hallucinate content that is unfaithful or contradictory to the source input. This is concerning as hallucinated text can mislead users and cause harm in real-world applications. The survey provides a broad overview of progress and challenges regarding detecting and mitigating hallucinations across major NLG tasks. The second paragraph highlights the structure and key topics covered. The survey first discusses definitions, categorizations, contributors, metrics, and mitigation methods for hallucinations from a general NLG perspective. It then provides a task-specific analysis of hallucinations in summarization, dialogue, question answering, data-to-text, machine translation, and vision-language tasks. For each task, it reviews the problem definition, metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions. The survey concludes by summarizing the current challenges and potential research directions to address hallucinations in NLG. Overall, the paper serves as a useful resource for understanding and tackling the pressing issue of hallucinations in neural natural language generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper presents an abstractive summarization approach based on a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. The authors propose a dual-stage attention mechanism that incorporates both word- and sentence-level attention. In the first stage, a word-level attention distribution is calculated to attend to the words in the source document. This helps the model focus on the relevant words when generating each word in the summary. In the second stage, a sentence-level attention distribution is calculated to determine the sentences in the source document that are most relevant to generating the current summary sentence. This two-stage attention allows the model to dynamically combine both fine-grained word-level and high-level sentence-level attention when generating the summary. The authors show that this dual attention mechanism improves summarization performance over standard sequence-to-sequence models with only word-level attention.

Based on my reading, this paper appears to be a survey paper that provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the hallucination problem in natural language generation (NLG). The key questions and problems it addresses are:- Hallucination is an emerging issue in NLG where models generate content that is unfaithful or meaningless given the input source. This is problematic as it degrades performance and raises safety concerns for real-world applications. However, there has been no prior comprehensive survey reviewing the progress and challenges around detecting and mitigating hallucinations across major NLG tasks. - The definitions, categorization, evaluation metrics, and mitigation methods for hallucination vary across different NLG tasks like summarization, dialogue, QA, data-to-text, translation, and vision-language tasks. There is a need to analyze the relationships between approaches across tasks to encourage collaborative efforts.- There are open challenges around developing more fine-grained and generalized evaluation metrics for hallucination, as well as exploring methods tailored for intrinsic vs extrinsic hallucination mitigation. Additional future directions are outlined for each specific NLG task.In summary, this survey provides the first unified overview of the hallucination problem across NLG, analyzing the progress made and consolidating insights from various communities to advance hallucination research as a whole. The synthesis of knowledge and future outlook is intended to promote more collaborative efforts between researchers working on different NLG tasks.
