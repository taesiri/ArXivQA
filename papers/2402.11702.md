# [Can ChatGPT Support Developers? An Empirical Evaluation of Large   Language Models for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise for code generation, but prior evaluations are limited to research settings. It's unclear how useful LLM-generated code is in real-world software development. 

- This paper aims to evaluate how developers interact with ChatGPT for code generation in practice and how helpful the generated code is in assisting them.

Methodology:
- The authors utilize the DevGPT dataset containing developer-ChatGPT conversations from GitHub to analyze interactions and code usage.

- For RQ1 on interaction, they categorize conversations by GitHub source and analyze length and strategies for improving code. 

- For RQ2 on code usage, they manually label 138 conversations linked in merged pull requests as exact match, modified, documentation, or supplementary information.

Key Findings:
- 98.5% of commit conversations involve code generation, while only 52.3% in code files. Commits require fewer prompt rounds (2.4) than code files (10.4).

- Developers primarily use ChatGPT to request improvements rather than additional generations from the same context.

- Only 16.8% of code is used verbatim. 26% is modified before use. 24.4% is used in documentation. 32.8% is not used.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of real-world developer-ChatGPT conversations for code generation
- Empirical examination of the usage of generated code 
- Publicly available labeled dataset of conversations

Conclusions:
- More work needed to improve LLMs before they can be integral to software development. Findings provide considerations for improving AI-assisted tools.
