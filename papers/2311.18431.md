# [On the convergence of adaptive first order methods: proximal gradient   and alternating minimization algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18431)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a general adaptive framework for proximal gradient (PG) methods to solve constrained nonsmooth optimization problems. The framework employs a novel backward-looking approach to estimate the local Lipschitz constant of the smooth component using only past information. This allows the algorithm to yield aggressive yet provably convergent stepsize policies without any linesearch. A key result is AdaPG, a simple two-parameter instance of this framework that unifies and strengthens existing adaptive PG methods in the literature. Convergence is established for AdaPG under mild conditions, notably allowing the stepsize sequence to be separated from zero. An adaptive variant of the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA) is also introduced by exploring the dual setting. This not only adds further adaptivity but also expands applicability beyond standard strong convexity assumptions. Overall, the proposed methods effectively exploit problem structure through adaptivity, possessing theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a general adaptive framework for proximal gradient methods that unifies and extends existing adaptive stepsize rules, provides larger stepsize policies, improved lower bounds on the stepsize, and explores an adaptive alternating minimization algorithm based on the dual setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a general adaptive framework for proximal gradient (PG) methods. The main contributions are:

1) It provides a unified analysis that bridges together and improves upon existing adaptive PG methods by enabling larger step sizes and, in some cases, tighter lower bounds.

2) It proposes AdaPG, a simple adaptive PG method with two parameters pi and r that can embrace and extend some existing algorithms through different parameter choices. Convergence is established and nonlinear rate results are provided.

3) An adaptive variant of the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA) is presented that incorporates additional adaptivity and expands applicability beyond standard strongly convex settings.

4) Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of AdaPG with different parameter options on several problems.

In summary, the paper advances the theory and algorithms for adaptive first-order methods through the proposed PG and AMA frameworks, analysis, and experimental results.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- Convex minimization
- Proximal gradient method
- Alternating minimization algorithm (AMA) 
- Locally Lipschitz gradient
- Adaptive stepsizes
- Linesearch-free methods
- Convergence analysis
- Worst-case convergence rates

The paper proposes an adaptive framework for proximal gradient methods that enables larger stepsize choices and provides improved lower bounds compared to previous works. It also develops an adaptive variant of the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA) that expands its applicability and incorporates additional adaptivity. The analysis focuses on establishing convergence and worst-case sublinear rates for the proposed algorithms.

Key features include the use of past iterate information to estimate local Lipschitz constants and set adaptive stepsizes in a "look backward" manner, relaxation of strong convexity assumptions in the AMA setting, nonvanishing stepsize guarantees to ensure convergence, and worst-case convergence rates that depend on the aggregate stepsize sequence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the adaptive proximal gradient method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a general framework involving time-varying parameters πk, ξk, νk. What is the motivation behind allowing these parameters to vary over time instead of keeping them fixed? How does this added flexibility potentially help improve performance?

2. The paper introduces two curvature estimates ck and lk in addition to the standard Lipschitz estimate Lk. What is the intuition behind using ck and lk? What are the benefits of having these separate estimates? 

3. The update rules for γk* involve parameters π and r. How does the choice of these parameters affect the tradeoff between aggressive step-size increases and more conservative steps? What guidelines are provided in the paper for good choices of π and r?

4. The lower bound γmin on the step-size involves the quantity m(ε) which captures the potential temporary decrease in step-size. Analyze the expression for m(ε) and discuss how it depends on the key parameters. 

5. The proof of convergence relies on showing that the function Uk(x) is non-increasing. What is the intuition behind this Uk function? How do the estimates ck, lk and the parameter ξk play a role in the descent property?

6. The adaptive framework allows the parameters πk, ξk, νk to vary over iterations. What conditions need to be satisfied by these parameters to ensure convergence as per Theorem 3?

7. The simplified AdaPG method is shown to generalize and improve upon prior arts. Compare and contrast the step-size update rule with those in the referenced papers. What are the key improvements?

8. The dual view of the alternating minimization algorithm is insightful. Discuss how the curvature estimates lk and Lk manifest themselves in the primal-dual setting. How does this view enable the adaptive step-size selection?

9. The local strong convexity assumption on ψ1 is weaker than standard assumptions. How does this expanded applicability arise? What modifications are needed in the analysis to handle this case?

10. The numerical experiments demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems. Analyze the results and discuss the relative strengths of the different parameter configurations of the proposed method.
