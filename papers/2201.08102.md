# [Safe Deep RL in 3D Environments using Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08102)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Is the ReQueST approach feasible for safe deep reinforcement learning in complex 3D environments using only human feedback (no simulator or procedural reward function)?

Specifically, the authors aim to determine:

1) If a high-quality pixel-based dynamics model can be learned from human trajectories to enable meaningful feedback. 

2) If the data requirements for the human trajectories and feedback are viable in terms of quantity and quality.

The overall goal is to show that ReQueST can enable training an RL agent with close to zero instances of unsafe behavior, using only human data. The paper tests this approach on a 3D first-person object collection task and compares it to standard RL algorithms.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that ReQueST is a viable approach for safe RL in complex 3D environments relying solely on human feedback, and the paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on a 3D object collection task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that the ReQueST method for safe reinforcement learning is feasible in complex 3D environments using real human data. Specifically:

- They show that a high-quality pixel-based dynamics model can be learned from human demonstrator trajectories in a 3D first-person environment, and this model can be used to generate simulated rollouts for human feedback. 

- They collect reward sketches from humans on simulated trajectories and use these to train a reward model.

- They show that using the learned dynamics and reward models, they can deploy an agent with model predictive control that achieves competent performance on an apple collection task with 10-20x fewer instances of unsafe behavior compared to a standard RL algorithm.

- They analyze the data requirements and show performance degrades gracefully with less data. They also examine failure modes when the models are imperfect.

Overall, this paper demonstrates that the ReQueST framework can scale to complex 3D environments and real human data, enabling learning from human feedback with reduced unsafe behavior during training. The key technical contributions are showing this is possible with high-dimensional pixel observations and analyzing the data needs and failure modes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that the ReQueST algorithm for safe deep reinforcement learning is feasible in complex 3D environments, enabling training of competent agents with orders of magnitude fewer instances of unsafe behavior compared to standard RL, using only safe human demonstrations and reward feedback.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on safe deep reinforcement learning in 3D environments:

- Data Sources: This paper uses entirely human-provided data to train the dynamics and reward models, unlike much prior work that relies more heavily on simulated data. Collecting sufficient real human data at scale is a key contribution.

- Environment Complexity: The 3D environment used here appears more visually complex than environments in most prior safe RL papers, with photorealistic rendering. This tests whether pixel-based models can scale.

- Feedback Mechanism: The paper uses reward sketches as the primary feedback signal, rather than more common choices like rankings/comparisons or binary safe/unsafe labels. This demonstrates the viability of high-bandwidth human feedback.

- Performance Metrics: Safety violations are evaluated rigorously, both during training and deployment. Many papers focus only on deployment performance. Evaluating safety during training is critical for safe exploration techniques.

- Agent Training: The paper uses model predictive control at deployment time rather than full end-to-end RL training. This simplifies training but limits the final performance level.

- Key Limitations: The environment complexity is still limited compared to real-world settings. And the agent relies heavily on human data collection, which may not always be feasible.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on testing whether human-in-the-loop approaches like ReQueST can scale to complex 3D environments. But many open challenges remain for real-world application of these ideas. The paper offers an exciting proof-of-concept rather than an end-to-end solution ready for deployment.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Applying ReQueST in real-world environments using real robots, to evaluate how well the approach scales beyond simulated 3D environments. The authors acknowledge that real-world evaluation is an important next step.

- Improving the quality and efficiency of the learned neural simulator models. The authors note there is room for progress on the video prediction quality and data requirements of the dynamics models. Architectural improvements could help.

- Comparing ReQueST to other safe exploration methods like constrained RL. The authors suggest this could be an informative comparison.

- Evaluating the human data requirements and scaling behavior more thoroughly across a wider range of environments and tasks. While the authors did some analysis of this, more work is needed to fully understand the practical data needs.

- Exploring whether unsupervised pretraining of dynamics models could help mitigate the reliance on large human datasets. The authors propose this as a potential way to reduce human data needs for some tasks.

- Developing better ways to evaluate when the models and data are "good enough" for safe deployment. The authors faced challenges in model validation.

- Using more sophisticated forms of human oversight during training, like debates between humans, to help scalability. The authors suggest this could address limitations around human ability to recognize unsafe behavior.

- Exploring whether incentives to tamper exist during the trajectory optimization process while training reward models. The authors outline a hypothetical failure case around this.

In summary, key directions are real-world tests, improving simulators, comparisons to other methods, better understanding of scaling, reducing human data needs, validation techniques, oversight mechanisms, and analyzing incentives.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called ReQueST (reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization) for safe deep reinforcement learning in complex 3D environments. The key idea is to first learn a neural simulator of the environment from safe human trajectories. This learned simulator is then used to efficiently learn a reward model by asking humans for feedback on hypothesized trajectories, avoiding the need to actually execute unsafe trajectories in the real environment during training. The method is demonstrated in a 3D first-person object collection task, where it enables training an agent with much lower instances of unsafe behavior compared to standard RL. The neural simulator and reward model are trained using only human data, showing the approach can work with imperfect real-world data. Overall, the paper shows that the ReQueST framework is feasible for safe exploration in complex 3D environments using data sourced entirely from human contractors.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using the ReQueST framework for safe deep reinforcement learning in complex 3D environments, using only human-provided data. ReQueST allows training a neural dynamics model and reward model from human demonstrations and feedback, then using these models to train agents with minimal unsafe behavior. The authors apply ReQueST to a 3D first-person object collection task, where the agent must gather apples while avoiding hazards like falling off edges or bumping into blocks. They show that agents trained with ReQueST exhibit much less unsafe behavior compared to a standard RL algorithm. 

The key contributions are showing that in complex 3D scenes, sufficient pixel-based neural simulator quality for human feedback can be achieved, and that the data requirements in terms of quantity and quality are viable using crowdsourcing. The dynamics and reward models are trained using only 160 person-hours of safe human trajectories and 10 person-hours of reward sketches. The resulting ReQueST agent demonstrates competent task performance with 3-20x fewer instances of unsafe behavior compared to traditional RL. This demonstrates that ReQueST is a promising approach for enabling safe exploration and training for real world tasks using only human input.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called ReQueST (reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization) for safe deep reinforcement learning in 3D environments using human feedback. The key idea is to first collect a large set of safe exploratory trajectories from human contractors in the real environment. These trajectories are used to train a neural dynamics model that can simulate the environment. The dynamics model is then used to generate hypothetical trajectory videos, on which humans provide reward feedback (specifically, reward sketches indicating good and bad events over time). This feedback is used to train a neural reward model. With the learned dynamics and reward models, the agent can then safely explore and learn in the simulated environment using model predictive control, avoiding unsafe states, before being deployed in the real environment. The main contribution is showing this process can work in visually complex 3D environments using imperfect real-world human data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to train reinforcement learning agents to avoid unsafe behavior, without relying on a simulator or procedural specification of safety constraints. 

The paper points out that standard online RL algorithms learn about safety constraints by experiencing unsafe states, which can have unacceptable consequences in the real world. Specifying safety constraints procedurally can also be difficult for many real-world tasks. 

The paper focuses on an approach called ReQueST, which aims to solve this problem by:

1) Learning a neural simulator (dynamics model) of the environment from safe human demonstrations.

2) Using this simulator to efficiently learn a reward model from human feedback on hypothetical trajectories. 

3) Using the learned models to train the agent with close to zero real-world safety violations.

The key questions examined are:

- Is this approach feasible in complex 3D environments, using pixel-based models trained on real human data? 

- Can neural simulator quality and coherence be high enough for meaningful human feedback?

- Are the data requirements viable in terms of quantity and quality of human demonstrations and feedback?

So in summary, the paper is investigating whether the ReQueST approach can enable safe RL in complex environments by learning neural simulators and reward models from human data, instead of relying on procedural specifications or real unsafe experiences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper relies on having a sufficient quantity of safe exploratory trajectories from human contractors to train the dynamics model. What are the limitations on the scalability of this approach if acquiring more trajectories becomes increasingly difficult or expensive? How could the method be adapted to work with fewer trajectories?

2. The method assumes that unsafe states or near-unsafe states can be recognized by humans providing the trajectories and reward sketches. However, for some tasks this may not be a reasonable assumption - for example if the unsafe states are imperceptible or abstract. How could the approach be modified to handle tasks where humans cannot reliably identify unsafe states?

3. The paper uses a relatively simple feedforward neural network architecture for the reward model. Could more sophisticated architectures like recurrent networks help improve the quality and robustness of the learned reward model? What challenges might arise in training more complex reward models?

4. The procedural reward bonus used in the paper led to some "reward hacking" behaviors from the agent. How could the reward modeling approach be improved to avoid the need for hand-designed reward bonuses? For example, using more advanced techniques for multi-stage tasks.

5. The model-based approach enabled evaluating the agent in simulation before deployment. However, the fidelity of the neural simulation was limited. What advances would be needed in generative modeling or simulation quality to enable robust evaluation of safety entirely in simulation?

6. How suitable would this technique be for real-world robotics tasks compared to simulated environments? What additional validation would be needed before deployment on physical robots?

7. The approach relies on model predictive control at deployment time. How well would it combine with more sophisticated modern RL algorithms like PPO or SAC instead? What challenges would arise?

8. How does the sample efficiency of this technique compare to other approaches for safe exploration like constrained RL or reward learning from demonstrations? Under what conditions is each approach likely to be more suitable?

9. Were there other forms of human feedback that could substitute or augment the reward sketches, like comparisons of trajectory pairs? How might they impact the quantity and quality of data needed?

10. The paper focuses on avoiding unsafe states, but does not consider more nuanced constraints like efficiency, precision, etc. How could the approach handle optimizing for additional objectives beyond safety?
