# [UCxn: Typologically Informed Annotation of Constructions Atop Universal   Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grammatical constructions that convey meaning through combinations of morphosyntactic elements (e.g. interrogatives) are not labeled holistically in Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. 
- UD treebanks break sentences into minimal grammatical parts but do not annotate larger meaning-bearing constructs.
- There is a lack of typologically-informed annotation in UD treebanks to enable crosslinguistic comparison of constructions.

Proposed Solution:
- Augment UD treebanks with a "UCxn" annotation layer to label meaning-bearing grammatical constructions.
- Take a typologically-informed approach to define constructions based on functional meaning rather than language-specific form.
- Develop morphosyntactic queries to identify instances of constructions in UD treebanks automatically.

Main Contributions:
- Case study analyzing 5 construction families (interrogatives, existentials etc.) in 10 languages using UD treebanks. 
- Identification of construction instances through graph pattern queries matched against UD syntactic trees.
- Proposal for UCxn annotation format and technical specification for augmenting UD data.
- Quantitative analysis and crosslinguistic comparison of construction strategies. 
- Methodological insights on describing/identifying constructions in language-general and language-particular ways.
- Foundation for future enrichment of UD treebanks with constructions to enable typological studies.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an approach to annotate meaning-bearing grammatical constructions in UD treebanks across languages in order to better capture constructions and enable typological research.
