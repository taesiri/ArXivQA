# [IndiVec: An Exploration of Leveraging Large Language Models for Media   Bias Detection with Fine-Grained Bias Indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Media bias detection is important to identify potential influence on public opinions. Prior works rely on training models tailored to specific datasets, lacking adaptability and explainability.

Solution - IndiVec Framework:
- Constructs a fine-grained bias indicator dataset with over 20,000 indicators across various dimensions (e.g. tone, sources, coverage) using large language models. 
- Builds a vector database of indicators and matches input text descriptors to top indicators using cosine similarity. Bias label is predicted by majority voting of the matched indicators.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel bias prediction framework using fine-grained bias indicators and a matching/voting process, instead of conventional classification.
- Constructs a comprehensive bias indicator dataset that enables more adaptable and explainable bias detection. 
- Experiments show IndiVec has superior performance over finetuning methods and ChatGPT across 4 datasets. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of proposed components.
- Matched top indicators from database provide explanations for predicted bias labels. Case studies demonstrate the framework's utility.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative bias detection framework called IndiVec that leverages a vector database of fine-grained bias indicators. By matching input text descriptors to these indicators and using majority voting, IndiVec achieves greater adaptability, explainability and performance compared to prior arts. The constructed indicator dataset also serves as a valuable bias analysis resource.
