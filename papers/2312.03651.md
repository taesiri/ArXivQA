# [MICRACLE: Inverse Reinforcement and Curriculum Learning Model for   Human-inspired Mobile Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03651)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MIRACLE, a novel socially-aware navigation algorithm that trains robots to interpret stimuli and navigate like humans. It uses a virtual reality platform called DeFINE to gather human navigation data in response to stimuli in a gamified, competitive environment. This allows for customizable and controlled data collection. MIRACLE then processes this data through a Deep Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning model to learn human-like navigation policies while limiting demonstrator bias. Testing showed MIRACLE effectively learned to locate goals based on stimuli, achieving a low loss of 2.7717. The algorithm was also successfully implemented on a Unitree quadruped robot which located a target goal based on a light stimulus. The multi-pronged approach of gamified data collection and robust deep learning enables MIRACLE to train robots to perceive and respond to stimuli much like humans. This research has promising applications for robot navigation in complex real-world environments.
