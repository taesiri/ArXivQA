# [Detecting algorithmic bias in medical AI-models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02959)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework for detecting algorithmic bias in medical AI models, specifically in the context of sepsis prediction. The authors utilize the flexible Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to identify regions within the feature space where an AI model demonstrates suboptimal performance on a subset of patients. After developing a sepsis prediction model using real patient data from Grady Memorial Hospital, they apply their CART-based technique to uncover potential areas of bias based on patient demographics and clinical factors. The method traces the worst-performing branches of the CART decision tree to characterize the specific groups that the sepsis prediction model struggles with. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical data showcase the ability of this model-agnostic approach to provide interpretable insights into an AI modelâ€™s failures and reliably estimate algorithmic bias regions without prior bias knowledge. Overall, it offers a practical solution for ensuring more equitable AI in sensitive medical applications.
