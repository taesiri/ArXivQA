# [MLPs Compass: What is learned when MLPs are combined with PLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have shown strong capabilities in capturing semantic information. However, it remains unclear what additional information simple MLP components can provide when combined with PLMs. 

- Recent works show MLPs can effectively capture structural features, even outperforming graph neural networks. But it is still an open question what is learned when MLPs are fused with powerful PLMs.

Methodology:
- The authors propose a simple yet effective probing framework with MLP components based on BERT's structure. 

- They introduce 10 probing tasks across 3 linguistic levels (surface, syntactic, semantic) to quantify the information gained from adding MLPs to PLMs.

- The framework keeps BERT weights frozen during probing and introduces MLPs between BERT representations and probe classifiers to attribute performance differences to the MLPs.

Results:
- Experiments show MLPs enhance PLMs' comprehension of linguistic structure, without needing to add structural bias.

- MLPs boost capability to capture surface, syntactic and semantic information. The enhancements are most consistent in higher layers of BERT.

- MLPs are most skilled at improving capture of syntactic and semantic information compared to surface tasks.

Conclusion:
- The paper provides interpretable insights into how basic MLPs can enhance PLMs' linguistic understanding, especially for syntactic and semantic structures.

- This sheds light on why adding MLPs improves PLM performance on tasks emphasizing certain language structures.

In summary, the key contribution is an analysis quantifying and explaining what additional linguistic information MLPs provide when combined with powerful PLMs like BERT, using a simple yet effective probing methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a probing framework with MLP components to study what additional linguistic information can be learned when MLPs are combined with pre-trained language models, finding that MLPs enhance PLMs' understanding of surface, syntactic, and especially semantic structures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a simple yet effective probing framework with MLP components to quantify and interpret what additional linguistic information is learned when MLPs are combined with pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifically:

- They design a probing framework by introducing MLP components between the PLM (BERT) representations and probe classifiers to study the information captured by the combination.

- They conduct extensive experiments on 10 probing tasks across 3 linguistic levels - surface, syntactic, and semantic. 

- The results demonstrate that adding MLPs enhances PLMs' ability to capture linguistic structure, even without injecting any structural bias. 

- They find MLPs are particularly good at improving PLMs' understanding of syntactic and semantic information.

- They provide insights into how MLPs can be effectively utilized to create PLM variants tailored for tasks emphasizing different linguistic structures.

In summary, the key contribution is using their proposed probing framework to provide an interpretable quantification and explanation of what additional linguistic knowledge is acquired when basic MLPs are combined with powerful PLMs.

The paper investigates what additional linguistic information can be learned when basic MLPs are combined with powerful PLMs like BERT. It introduces a probing framework and tasks to study the surface, syntactic, and semantic information captured with and without MLPs. The goal is to provide insights into designing PLM variants with MLPs to better capture certain linguistic structures and perform tasks like relation extraction. So the key focus is on interpreting what MLPs add to PLMs and probing different levels of linguistic knowledge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a probing framework containing MLP components to study what is learned when MLPs are combined with PLMs. What is the motivation behind using a probing framework instead of directly evaluating on end tasks? What are the advantages of this methodology?

2. The paper freezes the parameters of the PLM encoder during training and only updates the probe classifier. What is the rationale behind this? How does this methodology ensure that the encoder representations are probed rather than adapted for the probing tasks?

3. The paper introduces MLP components through a residual connection. Why is a residual connection used here rather than simply feeding the MLP outputs to the probe classifier? What benefit does this approach provide?

4. The probing tasks span three linguistic levels - surface, syntactic and semantic. What specific tasks are used to probe each of these levels? Why are these tasks appropriate for probing the particular linguistic phenomena?

5. The results show high variation in MLPs' impact across layers, with consistent benefits only in higher layers. What explanations are provided in the paper for this observation? How can this insight inform architectural decisions when combining MLPs with PLMs?

6. The paper shows MLPs enhance clustering performance on the probing tasks' representations. How is this analysis complementary to the main probing results? What additional insight does it provide about what MLPs learn?

7. The related work section highlights recent evidence that MLPs can capture structural information well. How do the findings in this paper align with or augment these prior observations about MLPs' capabilities?

8. The paper studies layer sensitivity by visualizing performance delta across layers. What other analyses could be done to further analyze sensitivity and characterize where MLPs provide the most benefit?

9. The paper focuses on BERT-base as the PLM. How could the analysis be extended to recent PLMs like mT5, PaLM, etc. that have different architectural properties? Would the findings transfer?

10. The framework proposed enables controlled study of how auxiliary components impact PLMs' learned representations. What other types of components could be studied with this framework? How else could this methodology be utilized?
