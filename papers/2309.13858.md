# [Impact of Human-AI Interaction on User Trust and Reliance in AI-Assisted   Qualitative Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13858)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question seems to be:

How do different coding strategies impact user trust, reliance, and perceived helpfulness in the context of AI-assisted qualitative coding systems (AIQCs)?

The authors aim to investigate how varying the granularity of the text selections and codes influences:

- The model performance of the AIQC (RQ1)
- Users' decision time and coding behavior when using the AIQC (RQ2)  
- Users' reliance on the AIQC (RQ3)
- Users' perceived trustworthiness and helpfulness of the AIQC (RQ4)
- Users' subjective preferences when using the AIQC (RQ5)

The key factors they manipulate are:

- Text Granularity: Sentence, Paragraph, Selective
- Code Granularity: Short codes, Long codes, Mixed codes

By exploring these different combinations of text and code granularity, the authors examine how it impacts the various aspects listed above, including trust, reliance and perceived helpfulness of the AIQC system. The overall goal is to gain insights into designing more effective AIQC systems that foster appropriate levels of user trust and reliance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Conducting a user study exploring how different coding strategies (specifically varying text selection granularity and code length granularity) impact user trust, reliance, and perceived helpfulness when using an AI-assisted qualitative coding system. 

2. Observing that qualitative coding is not a uniform task, but a series of subtasks with differing levels of complexity. Simpler subtasks exhibited higher behavioral trust/reliance but lower perceived helpfulness, while more complex subtasks showed the opposite pattern.

3. Identifying a potential discrepancy between perceived and behavioral trust measures, and highlighting risks of both under-reliance (failing to fully utilize the system) and over-reliance (excessive dependence) on the AI coding system.

4. Proposing design implications and principles to cultivate appropriate reliance and trust in AI-assisted qualitative coding systems, such as offering editable AI suggestions, implementing delays before showing suggestions, and providing explanations for suggestions.

5. Contributing results from a 3x3 split-plot study with 30 participants and a follow-up study with 6 participants exploring the impact of coding granularity on model performance, coding behavior, reliance, perceived trustworthiness and helpfulness.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be providing empirical evidence and design insights on how to develop trustworthy and properly relied upon AI systems for the complex and subjective task of qualitative coding. The study explores an important issue - balancing human and AI roles for effective collaboration.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in AI-assisted qualitative analysis:

- The focus on examining human-AI interaction and its impact on user trust and reliance seems novel. Most prior work in this field has focused on developing new techniques/systems for qualitative analysis, but not deeply studied trust or human factors. This paper provides useful new insights into these less explored areas.

- Exploring different coding strategies (text and code granularity) and their effects is a unique contribution. This systematically analyzes how subtle differences in the human-AI collaboration approach can significantly influence outcomes. Most research has not controlled or varied the coding process to this level of granularity.

- The mixed-methods approach combining system development, user studies, quantitative metrics, and qualitative feedback provides rich multifaceted data. Many papers in this domain are more theoretical or only present a coding system without in-depth user evaluations. The combination of system prototype and user studies is impactful.

- The findings reveal nuances of trust, task complexity, and user behavior that have not been characterized before. For example, the discrepancy between perceived and behavioral trust based on task difficulty is a novel finding. Most research assumes trust depends primarily on system accuracy.

- Discussion of under-reliance and over-reliance issues highlights unique challenges for human-AI collaboration in subjective tasks like coding. Dangers of excessive trust leading to unquestioning over-reliance are important to consider.

Overall, this paper makes several valuable research contributions through its holistic focus on human factors, nuanced mixed-methods evaluation, and emphasis on varied coding strategies. The analysis of trust formation, user behavior, preferences and reliance stands out compared to prior system-centric AI coding research. The findings provide useful implications for designing more transparent and calibrated AI collaborative systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better ways to evaluate model performance and establish more suitable ground truths for subjective tasks like qualitative coding. The authors acknowledge limitations in using users' final codes as approximate "ground truths" for evaluating model performance, which can introduce measurement errors. They suggest further research into better evaluation approaches for these types of subjective tasks.

- Extending the results to more types of content/domains, with the goal of gaining a broader understanding of users' needs for assistance and suggestions. The parameters used for controlling code/text granularity were simplistic and may vary significantly across coding domains and materials. More generalizable strategies for managing human-AI interaction habits should be investigated.

- Developing more precise measures for evaluating user trust in AI-assisted qualitative coding systems. The authors note limitations in assessing user trust, as users may struggle to differentiate their trust in individual system components. More targeted trust evaluation is needed.

- Motivating participants to execute tasks more efficiently to enable better measurement of decision-making time. The study could be improved by ensuring users work in a focused manner to precisely quantify time taken.

- Considering and integrating diverse AI methodologies beyond just text classification and topic modeling, such as generative AI, to support coding from multiple perspectives.

- Presenting explanations alongside AI-generated code suggestions to encourage appropriate reliance, avoid over-reliance risks, and stimulate deeper thinking.

- Enabling editing of suggestions post-selection to elevate user experience, perceived trustworthiness, and willingness to fully utilize the system.

Overall, the authors emphasize the need for continued research focused on fostering effective human-AI collaboration in qualitative coding by accounting for the nuances of interaction. Key goals include supporting the varied subtasks in open coding and mitigating risks of over-reliance and under-reliance on AI.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper describes a mixed-methods split-plot 3x3 study with 30 participants, supplemented by a follow-up study with 6 participants, exploring the impact of varying coding strategies on user trust and reliance in an AI-assisted qualitative coding system. The two factors manipulated were text selection granularity (sentence, paragraph, selective) and code length granularity (short 1-3 words, long 4-6 words, mixed 1-6 words). This resulted in 9 conditions that participants experienced in a counterbalanced order. For each condition, participants were tasked with coding 8 paragraphs selected from Yelp reviews. Quantitative data collected included model performance metrics, behavioral measures like decision time and coding behaviors, and survey responses on perceived trustworthiness and helpfulness. Qualitative data included think-aloud comments, post-task interviews, and a comparison of coding outputs with and without the AI system. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data provided insights into how different coding strategies influenced the model performance, user trust and reliance, and subjective preferences when using the AI-assisted coding system.
