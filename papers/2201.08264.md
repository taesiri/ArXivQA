# [End-to-end Generative Pretraining for Multimodal Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08264)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we develop an effective pretraining approach for multimodal video captioning that jointly trains an encoder and a decoder without relying on manually annotated captions?

The authors propose a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) that allows training an encoder-decoder model for video captioning using only unlabeled video data. The key ideas are:

1) Using future utterances from the video stream as targets for the decoder to generate, instead of manually annotated captions which are not available in unlabeled videos. 

2) Proposing a bidirectional generation loss that predicts future utterances from past context (forward direction) and also predicts past utterances from future context (backward direction). This helps align the generated captions better with the visual content.

3) Applying the loss at both encoder and decoder level allows end-to-end joint training of the full model from pixels and speech.

Overall, the central hypothesis is that the proposed pretraining approach can learn effective multimodal representations for video understanding tasks like captioning without relying on manually annotated caption labels. The results validate this hypothesis by showing state-of-the-art performance on multiple captioning benchmarks.

In summary, the key research question is how to do encoder-decoder pretraining for video captioning without caption labels, which is addressed through the bidirectional generation idea and end-to-end joint training of the model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) for learning from unlabeled videos. The key ideas are:

- MV-GPT trains both a multimodal video encoder and a sentence decoder jointly, unlike prior video-language pretraining methods that only train the encoder. This allows MV-GPT to generate captions.

- To overcome the lack of captions in unlabeled videos, MV-GPT uses future utterances as additional text and proposes a bidirectional generation objective. It predicts future utterances from present context and vice versa. 

- MV-GPT is trained end-to-end from pixels and words directly without relying on pre-extracted features.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal video captioning benchmarks like YouCook2, ViTT, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions.

- The pretrained model also transfers well to other video understanding tasks like VideoQA, video retrieval and action classification.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing MV-GPT, a novel generative pretraining framework for multimodal video representation learning, which performs very well on both generative and non-generative downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT), a new pretraining framework for learning from unlabeled videos that can be effectively transferred to generative tasks like multimodal video captioning by leveraging future utterances as textual supervision and training the encoder-decoder model bidirectionally in time.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of multimodal video captioning:

- This paper proposes a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) for learning from unlabeled videos. The key difference from prior work is the focus on training both a multimodal video encoder and a sentence decoder jointly, allowing the model to generate captions. 

- Most prior video-language pretraining frameworks like VideoBERT, ActBERT, and CoMVT pretrain only the video encoder using proxy tasks like masked language/frame modeling and video-text matching. They lack a decoder for generative captioning. 

- Some recent works like UniVL and M-MASS do pretrain encoder-decoder models using masked language modeling, but rely on reconstructing the original text rather than generating novel unseen captions. This paper argues that using future utterances as targets for generation provides stronger supervision.

- The proposed bidirectional loss with forward and backward generation is novel. It allows leveraging future utterances while keeping generated captions temporally aligned with the visual content.

- Unlike some prior works that use pre-extracted visual features, this paper trains the visual encoder directly from pixels allowing better transfer learning. The lightweight ViViT encoder makes this feasible.

- This framework achieves new state-of-the-art results on YouCook2, MSR-VTT, and other captioning benchmarks, outperforming prior video-language pretraining models by significant margins.

- The pretrained model also achieves strong results on other generative and discriminative video understanding tasks like VideoQA, retrieval, and classification, demonstrating the versatility of representations learned.

In summary, this paper pushes multimodal pretraining further towards generative captioning through a jointly trained encoder-decoder approach and a novel bidirectional generation loss suitable for unlabeled video data. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework across diverse tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Collecting more diverse and larger-scale pretraining datasets: The authors note that their model could potentially improve further with more pretraining data. They suggest collecting more unlabeled instructional videos to continue scaling up the pretraining.

- Curating the pretraining data more carefully: The authors acknowledge that large web-scraped datasets may contain unintended biases. They suggest more carefully filtering the pretraining data to avoid amplifying harmful biases. 

- Handling domain shift between pretraining and downstream data: The authors note their approach struggles when there is a significant domain gap between the pretraining and target data. They suggest collecting pretraining datasets that better match the characteristics of downstream tasks.

- Incorporating external knowledge: The authors propose incorporating object detectors or other forms of external knowledge to help their model understand visual concepts rarely seen during pretraining. This could improve generalization.

- Exploring new model architectures: While the authors demonstrate strong results with their transformer-based model, they do not claim it is optimal. Exploring other encoder-decoder architectures tailored for video could lead to further gains.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling up pretraining data, curating it better, reducing domain gap, incorporating external knowledge sources, and developing new model architectures specialized for video and language tasks. The authors position their work as an initial proof-of-concept that could be built upon along these dimensions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) for learning from unlabeled videos to improve performance on downstream tasks like video captioning. The key idea is to train an encoder-decoder model that can encode multimodal video inputs (frames + speech) and generate natural language descriptions. Since unlabeled videos lack sentence captions, they propose a novel pretraining objective. The model is trained to generate future utterances in the video given current context (frames + speech), and also generate current aligned utterances from future ones. This bidirectional objective allows end-to-end pretraining of both encoder and decoder on unlabeled data. They show state-of-the-art results on multiple video captioning benchmarks. The pretraining also learns powerful multimodal representations that transfer well to other video tasks like QA, retrieval and action classification. A key advantage is end-to-end training from pixels and speech compared to prior works relying on pre-extracted features. The results demonstrate the benefits of joint encoder-decoder pretraining with a generation objective for multimodal video understanding.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT), a new pretraining framework for learning from unlabeled videos. The goal is to develop a model that can encode multimodal videos (visual frames and transcribed speech) and also decode natural language sentences, which is useful for tasks like multimodal video captioning. The key innovation is a bidirectional utterance generation pretraining objective. The model is trained to generate a future utterance in the video given the current frames and utterances (forward generation). It is also trained to generate the current utterance from the frames and a future utterance (backward generation). This gives two sources of textual supervision without needing caption annotations. It allows joint training of the video encoder and sentence decoder end-to-end. 

Experiments show MV-GPT outperforms prior work on video captioning benchmarks including YouCook2, ViTT, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions. The visual encoder pretrained with MV-GPT also achieves strong results on other video tasks like VideoQA, retrieval and action classification. The bidirectional utterance generation objective is shown to be more effective than prior losses like masked language modeling. End-to-end training of the full model is also shown to improve over fixed pretrained encoders. Overall, MV-GPT presents an effective pretraining framework for multimodal generative tasks like captioning by leveraging unlabeled video with aligned speech.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "End-to-end Generative Pretraining for Multimodal Video Captioning":

The paper proposes a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) for learning from unlabeled videos to improve multimodal video captioning. The key idea is to train both a multimodal video encoder and a sentence decoder jointly using a novel bidirectional generation objective. Specifically, given a video clip with visual frames and aligned speech utterances, the model is trained to generate a future utterance based on the current context (forward generation), as well as generate the current utterance from a future utterance (backward generation). This provides two textual sources to optimize the encoder and decoder together. The model consists of modality-specific encoders for visual frames and speech, a multimodal encoder, and an autoregressive decoder. It is trained end-to-end from raw pixels and speech. Pretraining on a large unlabeled video dataset like HowTo100M with this approach transfers well to downstream multimodal video captioning tasks, outperforming prior work.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "End-to-end Generative Pretraining for Multimodal Video Captioning" is addressing the problem of effectively pretraining video and language models on unlabelled data for generative downstream tasks like video captioning. The key questions it seeks to address are:

1. How to pretrain an encoder-decoder model jointly from unlabelled videos which lack captioning targets? 

2. How to leverage unlabelled instructional videos with aligned speech transcripts but no captions to learn effective multimodal representations for video captioning?

3. How to design pretraining objectives that enable transferring the pretrained model to multimodal video captioning and generating high quality captions?

The paper proposes a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) to address these challenges. The key ideas are:

- Using future utterances in the video stream as captioning targets to pretrain the decoder.

- Proposing a bidirectional generation loss to predict future and present utterances given the multimodal context. 

- Pretraining the entire encoder-decoder model end-to-end from raw pixels and speech transcripts.

- Showing strong transfer learning results on multiple video captioning benchmarks by finetuning the pretrained model, significantly outperforming prior arts.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel pretraining strategy to learn an encoder-decoder model from unlabelled instructional videos for high quality multimodal video captioning. The pretraining technique and model design enable generating more accurate and detailed captions compared to existing methods.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT), a new pretraining framework for learning from unlabeled videos to generate captions for multimodal video captioning. The key ideas are:

- Most prior video-language pretraining methods only train the video encoder, not the full encoder-decoder model. This limits their ability to generate captions downstream. 

- MV-GPT trains both a multimodal video encoder and a sentence decoder jointly using unlabeled instructional videos. It uses a novel bidirectional generation objective.

- Since unlabeled videos lack captions, MV-GPT leverages future utterances as a second text source. The model is trained on a forward generation task to generate future utterances from the present context.

- A backward generation task is also introduced where the model must generate the present utterance from future utterances. This encourages tighter coupling of generated text to visual inputs.

- Additional losses like masked language modeling are used. The full model with visual/text encoders, multimodal encoder, and decoder is trained end-to-end.

- The approach achieves SOTA on multiple video captioning benchmarks including YouCook2 and MSR-VTT. The learned representations also transfer well to other video tasks like retrieval, QA, and classification.

- The generative pretraining approach is more effective than prior objectives like masked reconstruction. End-to-end training of the full model is critical for good performance.

In summary, the key innovation is a generative pretraining framework for multimodal encoders and decoders that uses future utterances, bidirectional generation, and end-to-end learning to achieve strong results on multimodal video captioning.
