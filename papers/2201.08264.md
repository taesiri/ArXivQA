# [End-to-end Generative Pretraining for Multimodal Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08264)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How can we develop an effective pretraining approach for multimodal video captioning that jointly trains an encoder and a decoder without relying on manually annotated captions?The authors propose a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) that allows training an encoder-decoder model for video captioning using only unlabeled video data. The key ideas are:1) Using future utterances from the video stream as targets for the decoder to generate, instead of manually annotated captions which are not available in unlabeled videos. 2) Proposing a bidirectional generation loss that predicts future utterances from past context (forward direction) and also predicts past utterances from future context (backward direction). This helps align the generated captions better with the visual content.3) Applying the loss at both encoder and decoder level allows end-to-end joint training of the full model from pixels and speech.Overall, the central hypothesis is that the proposed pretraining approach can learn effective multimodal representations for video understanding tasks like captioning without relying on manually annotated caption labels. The results validate this hypothesis by showing state-of-the-art performance on multiple captioning benchmarks.In summary, the key research question is how to do encoder-decoder pretraining for video captioning without caption labels, which is addressed through the bidirectional generation idea and end-to-end joint training of the model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new pretraining framework called Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT) for learning from unlabeled videos. The key ideas are:- MV-GPT trains both a multimodal video encoder and a sentence decoder jointly, unlike prior video-language pretraining methods that only train the encoder. This allows MV-GPT to generate captions.- To overcome the lack of captions in unlabeled videos, MV-GPT uses future utterances as additional text and proposes a bidirectional generation objective. It predicts future utterances from present context and vice versa. - MV-GPT is trained end-to-end from pixels and words directly without relying on pre-extracted features.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal video captioning benchmarks like YouCook2, ViTT, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions.- The pretrained model also transfers well to other video understanding tasks like VideoQA, video retrieval and action classification.In summary, the main contribution is proposing MV-GPT, a novel generative pretraining framework for multimodal video representation learning, which performs very well on both generative and non-generative downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Multimodal Video Generative Pretraining (MV-GPT), a new pretraining framework for learning from unlabeled videos that can be effectively transferred to generative tasks like multimodal video captioning by leveraging future utterances as textual supervision and training the encoder-decoder model bidirectionally in time.
