# [Compositional Prompt Tuning with Motion Cues for Open-vocabulary Video   Relation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an open-vocabulary video visual relation detection model that can generalize to unseen object and predicate categories?The key points are:- Video visual relation detection (VidVRD) aims to detect visual relationships between objects in video, but annotating all possible object and predicate categories is impractical. - Existing VidVRD methods operate on closed sets of categories seen during training. The authors propose a new "open-vocabulary" setting where the model must generalize to novel unseen categories at test time.- They utilize a large pretrained vision-language model (VLM) which has broad world knowledge to enable open-vocabulary generalization. However, directly using the VLM is suboptimal.- They propose a new method called RePro which learns "compositional" prompt representations that model subject and object roles separately. It also utilizes motion cues by learning prompts for different motion patterns.- RePro outperforms baselines by a large margin on open-vocabulary VidVRD benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen categories.In summary, the central hypothesis is that learning compositional, motion-based prompt representations can enable pretrained VLMs to generalize effectively to open-vocabulary video visual relation detection with unseen object and predicate categories. RePro provides a way to do this that outperforms other approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new task called "Open-Vocabulary Video Visual Relation Detection" (Open-VidVRD). This extends the existing video visual relation detection task to handle novel/unseen object and predicate categories during testing, beyond just novel combinations of seen categories. 2. It presents a new method called "Relation Prompt" (RePro) for this open-vocabulary setting. RePro has two key components:(a) Compositional prompt representations that model the prompt/context for the subject and object separately. This is better suited for predicates than a single holistic prompt.(b) Motion-cue based prompt groups, where prompts are divided into groups based on the motion patterns between subject and object. This allows incorporating motion context into the prompts. 3. RePro achieves new state-of-the-art results on two VidVRD benchmarks for both seen base categories used during training as well as unseen novel categories. The ablations also demonstrate the benefits of the compositional and motion-based prompt design.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel open-vocabulary VidVRD task, and presenting a new compositional prompt tuning method with motion cues that achieves strong performance on this challenging setting. The compositionality and use of motion cues seem to be the key novelties of RePro.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a compositional prompt tuning method with motion cues (RePro) for open-vocabulary video visual relation detection, which learns separate prompt representations for subject and object based on their motion patterns to better detect unseen predicates and generalize to novel objects and relations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of video visual relation detection:- It proposes a new open-vocabulary setting called Open-VidVRD, where the goal is to detect visual relations involving both unseen objects and predicates. Most prior work focuses on zero-shot learning for unseen relation combinations, but with a closed set of objects/predicates. - It explores prompt tuning, a technique gaining popularity in computer vision, for this video relation detection task. Prompt tuning has been explored before in image domains, but this work is one of the first to apply it to dynamic video relations.- The proposed compositional prompt representations are novel, modeling the context for subject vs object separately. Prior prompt tuning work uses more generic prompts.- Leveraging motion cues between subject and object to determine prompt selection is a new idea introduced in this work. Most prompt tuning relies only on visual appearance, not motion patterns.- Experiments demonstrate strong improvements on open-vocabulary detection compared to competitive baselines. The compositional prompt design is shown to be particularly beneficial.- The approach is simple and does not require complex architectures or loss functions beyond standard prompt tuning. Yet it achieves state-of-the-art on two datasets.Overall, the key novelties are in the problem definition and the intuitive yet effective prompt design leveraging compositionality and motion cues. The paper shows prompt tuning can be adapted to the dynamic open-vocabulary video setting with proper design considerations.
