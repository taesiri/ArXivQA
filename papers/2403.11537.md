# [Semantic Prompting with Image-Token for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11537)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Semantic Prompting with Image-Token for Continual Learning":

Problem:
- Continual learning aims to learn new tasks continuously while retaining knowledge from previous tasks. A key challenge is catastrophic forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones.
- Existing rehearsal-based methods require storage of old data. Recent prompt-based methods overcome this but depend on a task selection process to choose prompts, which can fail if task prediction is imperfect.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel prompt-based continual learning method called "I-Prompt" that eliminates the task selection process. 
- It selects prompts based on semantic similarity of image tokens instead of task identity. This makes it robust to imperfect task predictions.

Key Ideas:
- Semantic Prompt Matching: Determines prompts based on similarity between image tokens using the self-attention structure of vision transformers. Achieves task-agnostic prompting by using visual features rather than task identity.
- Image Token-Level Prompting: Applies prompts directly to image tokens in intermediate layers rather than input. Allows efficiently training token-specific prompts.
- Uses image tokens along with class token for final prediction. Allows better utilization of visual information.

Contributions:
- First task-agnostic prompt-based continual learning method that eliminates reliance on task selection process.
- Leverages semantic information within images themselves for prompting instead of task identity.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R/A and CUB datasets, especially in task-imbalanced scenarios.
- Provides detailed ablation studies analyzing the approach.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way of performing prompt-based continual learning without dependence on task identity that shows promising performance and analysis.
