# [Scaling Is All You Need: Training Strong Policies for Autonomous Driving   with JAX-Accelerated Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15122)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for training policies for autonomous driving, but it remains unclear how well RL policies would perform on large real-world driving datasets and how to efficiently scale up RL to handle the complexity of real-world driving. The key challenges are: (1) Handling the diversity of rare events encountered in real driving scenarios; (2) Efficiently scaling RL with increasing amounts of driving data, longer experiments, and larger models.

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes a large-scale RL framework that combines behavioral cloning (BC) and RL to learn driving policies. The key components are:

1. A hardware-accelerated simulator using JAX that efficiently replays real-world driving segments at scale by batching and accelerating the simulation loop.

2. A multi-GPU distributed RL training pipeline with a V-trace off-policy actor-critic algorithm that scales linearly to billions of agent steps.

3. Pre-training with supervised BC on 6000 hours of expert driving data followed by fine-tuning using RL with a simple reward function that rewards progress and penalizes collisions, traffic violations etc.

4. Systematic evaluation on safety, progress and comfort metrics on a complex urban driving dataset from San Francisco.

Main Contributions:

1. Developing the above scalable framework combining an accelerated simulator with distributed RL to tackle large-scale autonomous driving learning.

2. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that simultaneously scaling dataset size, model size and agent steps leads to significantly improved driving policies - reducing failure rate by 57% over prior work while improving progress by 23%.  

3. The best 25M parameter policy trained on 6000 hours of driving and 2 billion agent steps sets a new state-of-the-art on urban driving, substantially improving safety and reliability.

4. Detailed ablations quantifying the impact of scaling model size, data size and agent steps on metrics like collisions, progress and traffic violations.

In summary, this paper makes significant progress towards enabling safe data-driven autonomous driving policies by proposing methods to efficiently scale simulator-based RL to handle complex real-world driving scenarios. The key insight is that large-scale modeling is crucial to handle the immense variability of real driving.
