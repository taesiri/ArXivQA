# [Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02145)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Marigold, a novel method for monocular depth estimation based on fine-tuning a pretrained latent diffusion model (Stable Diffusion). The key insight is that the rich visual priors captured in diffusion models can enable better depth estimation with improved generalization. Specifically, the authors propose keeping the latent space intact and only modifying the denoising U-Net, allowing efficient fine-tuning with just 74k synthetic RGB-D pairs. Despite training solely on synthetic data, Marigold delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets including NYUv2, KITTI, and ScanNet. It demonstrates accurate depth maps that capture overall scene layout along with thin structures and flat surfaces. The methodâ€™s zero-shot transfer ability and performance gains (over 20% in some cases) highlight the significance of comprehensive world knowledge for monocular depth estimation. Marigold sets a new state of the art for versatile, high-quality monocular depth prediction in the wild.
