# [Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02145)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Marigold, a novel method for monocular depth estimation based on fine-tuning a pretrained latent diffusion model (Stable Diffusion). The key insight is that the rich visual priors captured in diffusion models can enable better depth estimation with improved generalization. Specifically, the authors propose keeping the latent space intact and only modifying the denoising U-Net, allowing efficient fine-tuning with just 74k synthetic RGB-D pairs. Despite training solely on synthetic data, Marigold delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets including NYUv2, KITTI, and ScanNet. It demonstrates accurate depth maps that capture overall scene layout along with thin structures and flat surfaces. The methodâ€™s zero-shot transfer ability and performance gains (over 20% in some cases) highlight the significance of comprehensive world knowledge for monocular depth estimation. Marigold sets a new state of the art for versatile, high-quality monocular depth prediction in the wild.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Monocular depth estimation aims to predict a depth map from a single RGB image. This is an ill-posed problem that requires strong scene understanding priors about layout, shapes, sizes, etc. Recent methods have shown impressive progress by leveraging large datasets and model capacity, but still struggle to generalize to unfamiliar image domains. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Marigold, a novel approach that leverages the rich visual priors captured in a pretrained generative model called Stable Diffusion. By fine-tuning only the diffusion model's de-noising U-Net on synthetic depth data, Marigold retains the strong natural image prior in Stable Diffusion's latent space and is able to generalize very well.

Key Points:
- Marigold simply fine-tunes the U-Net of Stable Diffusion while keeping the latent space intact. This allows transferring rich generative image priors to depth prediction.
- Training uses only 74K synthetic samples from Hypersim and Virtual KITTI datasets. But Marigold generalizes very well to real datasets, even unseen ones.
- Marigold outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several datasets like NYUv2, KITTI, ScanNet, etc. It shows over 20% error reduction on some datasets.
- Qualitative results show Marigold captures overall scene layout as well as thin structures very well. This demonstrates the benefit of generalization from the pretrained generative model.
- Main contributions are (1) fine-tuning protocol to adapt generative models for depth prediction, retaining useful priors (2) Marigold model that sets new state-of-the-art for monocular depth estimation through strong generalization.

In summary, this paper shows how generative image priors can significantly improve monocular depth prediction quality and generalization ability. By fine-tuning only the last stages of a diffusion model, it achieves compelling performance improvements.
