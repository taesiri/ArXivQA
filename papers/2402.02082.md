# [GliDe with a CaPE: A Low-Hassle Method to Accelerate Speculative   Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02082)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from high latency during inference due to their autoregressive nature, limiting their use for applications requiring real-time responses.  
- Speculative decoding has been proposed to accelerate LLM decoding by using a faster draft model to propose tokens that are then verified in parallel by the LLM. However, existing solutions are limited in improving the acceptance rate of proposed tokens.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce \textsc{GliDe}, a draft model architecture that leverages the key-value (KV) cache from the target LLM's past computations to help generate proposal tokens that are more likely to be accepted. This is done via cross-attention layers in \textsc{GliDe}.
- Propose \textsc{CaPE} method to expand proposal sequences with additional candidate tokens at each position based on the draft model's confidence scores, further increasing acceptance chances.

Main Contributions:
- \textsc{GliDe} significantly improves acceptance rates over previous draft models, with over 19.9% average increase across benchmarks. It also reduces expected decoding latency.
- Adding \textsc{CaPE} proposal expansion brings further speedups, achieving up to 2.61x faster decoding over standard autoregressive decoding.
- Proposed methods are easy to implement and require low additional computational overhead.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate clear improvements in acceptance rates and walltime speedups using the proposed \textsc{GliDe} and \textsc{CaPE} techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two methods, GliDe and CaPE, to accelerate the decoding speed of large language models using speculative decoding, with GliDe reusing the target model's cached keys and values to help the draft model make better proposals, and CaPE expanding proposals with additional candidate tokens based on the draft model's confidence scores.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes two methods to accelerate speculative decoding of large language models:

1) GliDe (Glimpse Draft Model): A draft model architecture that inserts cross-attention layers to enable the draft model to reuse the cached keys and values from the target model's last round of verification. This allows the draft model to make proposals more similar to what the target model would generate, improving the acceptance rate.

2) CaPE (Confidence-aware Proposal Expansion): A method to expand the draft model's proposals with additional candidate tokens at each position, with the number of extra tokens determined dynamically based on the draft model's confidence scores. This further increases the chance of the target model accepting one of the proposed tokens.

The key insight is that by enabling the draft model to better approximate the target model (through GliDe) and by expanding the proposals to give the target model more verified options (through CaPE), the overall speculative decoding latency can be substantially reduced. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in acceptance rate and wall-time speedups over previous draft models and speculative decoding methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Speculative decoding - A decoding framework that uses a small draft model to reduce the latency of large language models by predicting future tokens for parallel verification.

- GliDe (Glimpse Draft Model) - A modified draft model architecture proposed in this paper that inserts a cross-attention layer to reuse the cached keys and values from the target large language model. This allows it to make predictions more aligned with the target model.

- CaPE (Confidence-aware Proposal Expansion) - A method proposed in this paper to expand the draft model's proposals with additional candidate tokens, with the number of candidates dynamically determined based on the confidence scores of the tokens.

- Acceptance rate - A key evaluation metric that measures the likelihood of the target model accepting the tokens proposed by the draft model. Improving this is a main goal.

- Expected speedup - A theoretical speedup metric that combines the acceptance rate, draft model efficiency, and other factors to estimate the decoding speedup.

- KV cache - The cached keys and values from the previous computations of the target model that the GliDe draft model is able to reuse via cross-attention. This is a key enabler of GliDe's better performance.

In summary, the key focus is on using architectural innovations like GliDe and CaPE to improve the acceptance rate and expected/actual speedup of speculative decoding systems built around large language models. The core metrics are around measuring decoding latency reductions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two main contributions - GliDe and CaPE. Can you explain in more detail how GliDe enables the draft model to "glimpse" at the target model's cached keys and values? What are the specific modifications made to the draft model architecture to enable this?

2. In the GliDe draft model architecture, cross-attention layers are inserted to enable access to the target model's KV cache. What considerations went into deciding which target model layers the draft model should cross-attend to? How was the training adapted to simulate delayed KV cache access at inference time?

3. For the CaPE method, what motivated using the draft model's confidence scores to determine the number of additional candidate tokens to include in the expanded proposals? Can you explain in more detail the rationale behind the specific mapping used from confidence scores to expansion set sizes? 

4. The paper compares CaPE to using beam search for proposal expansion. What reasons does it give for CaPE outperforming beam search in terms of speed? What are the key differences in how CaPE and beam search generate expanded proposals?

5. One limitation mentioned is that GliDe needs to be retrained for each new target model. What suggestions does the paper give for how this limitation could be addressed in future work? How feasible would it be to incorporate GliDe training simultaneously with target model training?

6. The paper evaluates GliDe and CaPE separately in two sets of experiments. What was the motivation behind separating the evaluation? What metrics were used to assess the contribution of each proposed method?

7. For the GliDe evaluations, what baseline draft models was it compared against? What were the main findings in terms of relative costs, acceptance rates and expected speedups? Were the improvements statistically significant?

8. In the CaPE evaluations, what baseline methods was it compared against? Why was acceptance rate not used as an evaluation metric here? What practical speedup factors were achieved over the baselines?

9. An analysis experiment looked at using different target model layers for the GliDe draft model's cross-attention. What did this analysis find about whether higher or lower layers were more beneficial to cross-attend to? How did attendance to different layers impact acceptance rates?

10. The paper demonstrates GliDe and CaPE using Vicuna and Mistral target models. Do you think the improvements shown would generalize to other model architectures and sizes? Why or why not? What factors may influence the generalizability?
