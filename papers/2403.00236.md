# [Benchmarking zero-shot stance detection with FlanT5-XXL: Insights from   training data, prompting, and decoding strategies into its near-SoTA   performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Stance detection is an important NLP task that aims to determine the position or attitude (in favor, against, or neutral) expressed in a text towards a given target. 
- It has applications across domains like political science and communication studies but is challenging to perform accurately, especially on noisy social media texts.

Approach 
- The authors investigate zero-shot stance detection capabilities of FlanT5-XXL, an 11B parameter instruction-tuned language model, on 3 Twitter datasets.
- They frame stance detection as a question answering task and test performance using different prompts, instructions, and decoding strategies in a truly zero-shot setup without any training.

Main Findings
- FlanT5-XXL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art results, including fine-tuned models, demonstrating surprising efficacy.
- Performance varies based on phrasing of prompts and presence of oppositions/negations. Answering questions with oppositions or negations is harder.  
- Prompt perplexity correlates negatively with performance. There is little sensitivity to instruction paraphrasing.
- Default greedy decoding performs competitively suggesting off-the-shelf usage viability. Alternate decoding strategies do not necessarily improve performance.
- Differences in performance across decoding strategies may be partially explained by positivity bias in FlanT5-XXL's training data.

Contributions
- First rigorous benchmarking of open-source LLM's zero-shot stance detection on English tweets.
- Analysis providing insights into sensitivity of performance to various factors like prompts, instructions and decoding strategies.
- Ensure no data contamination from test sets and identify potential explanatory factors affecting variability in scores.
