# [Using Contextual Information for Sentence-level Morpheme Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in morpheme segmentation focus primarily on word-level segmentation, often neglecting the contextual relevance within the sentence. 
- Existing methods for sentence-level segmentation treat it as a zero-shot extension of word-level segmentation, ignoring sentence context.

Proposed Solution:
- Redefine morpheme segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence problem, taking the whole sentence as input rather than isolating words.
- Implement transformer-based encoder-decoder models for the task, training on sentence-level data.
- Experiment with monolingual models per language as well as a multilingual model.
- Use techniques like data augmentation (with word-level data) and upsampling to expand limited training data.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate that the multilingual model consistently exhibits better performance compared to monolingual models, especially for lower-resource languages.
- Show that simple data augmentation and upsampling techniques can improve performance for low-resource scenarios.  
- Achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art on English segmentation (F1: 95.10) and showcase limitations for lower-resource Czech (F1: 75.79) and Mongolian (F1: 72.54).
- Formulate the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem with entire sentences as inputs, helping preserve contextual information.

In summary, the paper tackles sentence-level morphological segmentation using transformer encoder-decoder models operating on full sentences, rather than individual words. It shows promising results for high-resource languages, and limitations for low-resource scenarios, while demonstrating the utility of multilingual modeling and data augmentation techniques.
