## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a method to reconstruct dynamic radiance fields from monocular videos without requiring accurate camera poses as input. Specifically:- The paper presents an approach to jointly optimize camera poses and two radiance fields (static and dynamic) to model a dynamic scene. This avoids relying on potentially erroneous poses from SfM systems.- The method includes careful designs like a coarse-to-fine strategy, epipolar geometry to exclude moving pixels, deformation fields, time-dependent appearance models, and regularization losses to improve robustness. - Extensive experiments validate the approach on challenging real-world datasets where typical SfM systems fail. Both quantitative metrics and visual results demonstrate favorable performance compared to prior state-of-the-art dynamic view synthesis techniques.In summary, the key contribution is a robust approach to reconstruct time-varying scene geometry and appearance from monocular video without known camera poses. This is achieved through joint optimization of poses and static/dynamic radiance fields guided by architectural designs and losses to improve consistency. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness for challenging dynamic scenes.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in dynamic radiance field reconstruction:- This paper focuses on handling challenging real-world videos where standard SfM fails, while most prior work assumes accurate camera poses are available. The key novelty is jointly optimizing poses and scene representation without known poses.- The method combines ideas from prior work like coarse-to-fine pose optimization (BARF), heuristic masking (NSFF), and scene flow regularization (DynamicNeRF). The combination of these ideas is tailored for the pose estimation problem.- Compared to concurrent work like Nerfies or HyperNeRF, this method incorporates more architectural designs and losses to make the pose estimation more robust. The ablation studies validate these choices.  - The experiments focus on challenging datasets like Sintel, DAVIS, and real iPhone videos where other methods fail to reconstruct or synthesize novel views. Both pose accuracy and view synthesis quality are evaluated.- Overall, this paper pushes the boundary of dynamic view synthesis to more practical but unconstrained videos. The joint optimization over poses and scene is critical for this robustness. The comprehensive experiments and comparisons validate the robustness over existing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, this paper combines ideas from prior work in a novel way for robust pose estimation and view synthesis from monocular video. The experiments on challenging data demonstrate clear improvements in robustness over other recent techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions:- Improving the robustness and generalization of dynamic radiance field methods, especially for unconstrained real-world videos. They note limitations with handling complex object motions, occlusions, illumination changes, etc.- Developing techniques to handle longer video sequences. The scenes they tested on are relatively short. Scaling to longer sequences presents challenges. - Exploring different scene representations beyond voxels, such as point clouds or triangle meshes. These may allow higher resolution at lower memory cost.- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised approaches that don't rely on strong prior knowledge about the scene and motion. Their method uses motion masks and optical flow as input. Removing these dependencies could improve general applicability.- Extending the method to handle multiple simultaneous moving cameras, not just a single observer. This could enable virtual cinematography applications.- Reducing computation time and memory requirements to scale to higher resolutions. Their method takes 28 hours of training on a V100 GPU. Faster optimization and inference would benefit real-time applications.- Applying the technology to virtual and augmented reality scenarios with complex interactions between users and environments. The free viewpoint synthesis ability could enhance realism and immersion.- Combining dynamic radiance fields with graphics techniques like neural rendering, deferred rendering, and texture mapping to further improve novel view synthesis quality.So in summary, they see opportunities to enhance robustness, scalability, generalization, speed, and integration with other methods as interesting future work after this paper.
