# [Holistic chemical evaluation reveals pitfalls in reaction prediction   models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09004)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a holistic evaluation pipeline for assessing chemical reaction prediction models, addressing limitations of current practices which rely almost exclusively on top-k accuracy. They introduce the CHORISO dataset of over 2 million academic reactions for evaluation, along with chemistry-specific metrics like stereoselectivity and regiochemical selectivity, and additional scenarios like out-of-distribution testing. Applying this methodology to state-of-the-art models reveals important differences - for example, the Molecular Transformer performs better on stereoselective reactions while the Graph2SMILES model shows greater robustness to out-of-distribution shifts. The authors argue that this evaluation approach, rather than determining an outright best model, provides a detailed perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of each model to inform selection and guide future development. Ultimately, progress in holistic assessment aims to produce more reliable, trustworthy models to accelerate chemical discovery.
