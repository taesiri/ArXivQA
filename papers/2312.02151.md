# [Guarding Barlow Twins Against Overfitting with Mixed Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02151)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper revisits the popular Barlow Twins self-supervised learning algorithm and identifies its susceptibility to overfitting, especially when using higher-dimensional embeddings. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and STL-10, the authors demonstrate that the representation quality and downstream task performance of Barlow Twins peak and then deteriorate during training as the embedding dimensionality increases. They attribute this phenomenon to the lack of explicit sample interaction in the Barlow Twins objective compared to contrastive learning approaches. To address this limitation, the authors propose Mixed Barlow Twins which incorporates ideas from MixUp data augmentation to introduce sample interaction. Specifically, synthetic samples are generated by linearly interpolating between two augmentations of the same image, and a regularization term is formulated based on the assumption that linear mixes in input space translate to linear mixes in embedding space. Adding this simple yet effective regularization allows Mixed Barlow Twins to avoid overfitting, leading to new state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning on the evaluated datasets. The method also shows strong performance in the large-scale ImageNet setting. By identifying and mitigating the overfitting tendencies of Barlow Twins, this work improves the generalization of the representations to downstream tasks.
