# [SP-DiffDose: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Radiation Dose Prediction   Based on Multi-Scale Fusion of Anatomical Structures, Guided by   SwinTransformer and Projector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06187)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SP-DiffDose, a novel method for automated radiation therapy dose distribution prediction based on a conditional diffusion model. It addresses the issue of over-smoothing in dose predictions from existing deep learning methods. SP-DiffDose utilizes a combination of convolutional and Swin Transformer layers to extract multi-scale anatomical features from CT images and organ segmentations. These features are fused to guide the diffusion model in reversing the noise-addition process and outputting accurate high-frequency dose maps. Additionally, a projector module is introduced to further optimize the fused features. Experiments on a chest tumor dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods like Cascaded 3D UNet and DiffDP in terms of dose score, DVH score, homogeneity index, and visual quality. The higher precision in predicting beam direction, dose fall-off, and organ-at-risk doses proves the potential of SP-DiffDose to automate and improve radiotherapy planning. Overall, this diffusion-based approach advances dose prediction through effectively incorporating anatomical knowledge and capturing subtler dose distribution details.
