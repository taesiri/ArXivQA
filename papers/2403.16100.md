# [Specifying Agent Ethics (Blue Sky Ideas)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine ethics systems aim to enable computational systems to make ethical decisions. However, there are ethical dilemmas with no agreed upon solutions, making it challenging to verify if these systems are reasoning correctly.

- The authors argue that just eliciting stakeholder values is not enough to guarantee the correctness of machine ethics systems. They provide an example (the smart home evacuation scenario) where despite stakeholder sign-off, subtle details in the reasoning could lead the system to make unethical decisions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors define two broad categories of ethical properties that machine ethics systems should satisfy:
  1) Properties establishing correctness of the ethical reasoning implementation
  2) Properties using specific scenarios to validate the system has the right ethical rules

- For the first category, with consequentialist theories, one can verify the system always chooses the "least worst" option according to the theory. 

- For the second category, scenarios can encode high-level ethical principles or detailed situations to check the system behaves correctly. 

Main Contributions:
- Identified need to verify machine ethics systems even when stakeholder values are clear, due to possibility of unintended consequences

- Provided real-world motivating example of smart home system failing to behave correctly despite explicit stakeholder sign-off

- Proposed two categories of verifiable properties for machine ethics covering implementation correctness and validation of ethical rules

- Presented examples of such properties from the authors' previous work in robotics and autonomous systems

In summary, the key insight is that verifying machine ethics requires going beyond validating stakeholder values, to check both correctness of implementation and broader compliance with ethical principles. The paper makes first steps at defining a taxonomy of verifiable properties in this problem domain.
