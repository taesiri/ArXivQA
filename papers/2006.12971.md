# [Gaining Insight into SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Severity Using   Self-supervised Edge Features and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12971)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research aims of this paper are:1. To develop a deep learning framework to gain biological insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity using single-cell omics data. 2. To create a new approach for generating self-supervised edge features and incorporate them into graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve performance on node classification tasks.3. To apply the model to two biological datasets - SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial epithelium organoids and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from COVID-19 patients - to predict the disease state of individual cells.4. To use model interpretability techniques to identify key genes and cell types that determine the course and severity of COVID-19, contributing to potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets.In summary, the central goal is to leverage deep learning on single-cell transcriptomic data to elucidate the molecular and cellular determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. The key novelties are the self-supervised edge feature framework and multi-label node classification set-up to predict multiple disease states at single-cell resolution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a new framework and deep learning architecture to gain molecular and cellular insights into COVID-19 severity and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, the key contributions are:1) Proposing a method to create new edge features for graphs using self-supervised and unsupervised learning. These edge features are then combined with node features and fed into graph neural networks for node classification tasks.2) Developing a model architecture that builds on Graph Attention Networks (GATs) by incorporating the self-supervised edge features via a Set Transformer. This model achieves significant improvements in predicting disease states of individual cells compared to baseline GAT and GCN models.3) Applying the model to two biological datasets - SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial epithelium organoids across timepoints, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from COVID-19 patients. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting infection state and disease severity at the individual cell level.4) Using attention mechanisms and gradient-based interpretability methods to identify key genes and cell types that determine SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility and COVID-19 severity. This provides biological insights into the mechanisms and biomarkers of COVID-19.5) Demonstrating the utility of graph neural networks combined with self-supervised learning on edge features for making predictions and gaining insights from complex single-cell datasets. The model and framework could potentially be applied to other biomedical problems.In summary, the key innovation is in developing self-supervised edge features to enhance graph neural networks for predictive modeling and interpretability on single-cell biomedical data to study COVID-19. The model achieves strong predictive performance and the biological insights may open up new therapeutic targets or biomarkers worthy of further investigation.
