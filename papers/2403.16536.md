# [VMRNN: Integrating Vision Mamba and LSTM for Efficient and Accurate   Spatiotemporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Spatiotemporal forecasting is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal dynamics in real-world data. Existing methods combining CNNs/ViTs with RNNs have limitations - CNNs have narrow receptive fields while ViTs have high computational costs for their attention mechanisms. There is a need for efficient architectures that can capture long-range dependencies for accurate forecasting.

Method:
The paper proposes a novel recurrent cell called VMRNN that integrates Vision Mamba (VM) blocks with LSTM. VM blocks can model long sequences efficiently using scan-based selective state space models. 

Specifically, the VMRNN cell processes input patches and previous states through VM blocks to extract spatial dependencies, which are then fed to LSTM to capture temporal dependencies. The overall architecture stacks multiple VMRNN cells with downsampling and upsampling layers for hierarchical understanding.

Contributions:

1) Introduces VMRNN - the first work to integrate VM blocks with LSTM for spatiotemporal forecasting, harnessing VMs' prowess in long sequence modeling.

2) Proposes VMRNN-based architectures with upsampling/downsampling for hierarchical feature learning suited for forecasting.

3) Evaluations on Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ and KTH show VMRNN matches or beats state-of-the-art across metrics, with lower model size and computational costs, presenting it as an efficient and effective new forecasting baseline.

In summary, the paper makes key innovations in merging VM blocks with RNNs to develop the powerful VMRNN cell and associated architectures for advancing spatiotemporal forecasting research and applications.
