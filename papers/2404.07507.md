# [Learning to Classify New Foods Incrementally Via Compressed Exemplars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing food image classification systems rely on static datasets and fail to adapt to new/evolving food categories reflecting changing dietary preferences over time. This limits their practical applicability.

- Class incremental learning (CIL) methods are designed to learn continuously from new data but suffer from catastrophic forgetting of old classes. 

- Memory replay approaches that store exemplars from old classes are limited by small memory budgets, leading to data imbalance between old and new classes and poor generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- Use neural image compression techniques to compress exemplars from old classes, reducing storage needs, allowing more exemplars to be stored and balancing old and new class data.

- Employ a fix-decoder compressor training strategy to maintain backward compatibility of encoded data.

- Apply class activation map (CAM) based background compression to preserve foreground details and minimize domain shift between original and compressed images.   

Contributions:
- Novel framework to integrate neural compression into class incremental learning for food image classification, enhancing practical applicability.  

- Plug-and-play compressor training method compatible with different neural compression techniques.

- Demonstrated reduced memory needs for exemplars and improved classification accuracy on Food-101, VFN-74 and ImageNet-100 datasets.

- Ablation studies validate importance of foreground details and efficacy of CAM-based background compression over other strategies.

- Established principles to advance practical and continually learning food recognition systems that adapt to dynamic real-world data.
