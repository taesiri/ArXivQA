# [CorresNeRF: Image Correspondence Priors for Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06642)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes CorresNeRF, a novel method to leverage image correspondence priors to supervise neural radiance field (NeRF) training, leading to better performance for novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction from sparse input views. The authors design an adaptive pipeline to automatically generate dense, high-quality image correspondences from off-the-shelf methods and incorporate them into NeRF training via correspondence pixel reprojection and depth losses. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline NeRF models as well as state-of-the-art view synthesis methods, with over 3dB PSNR gain on the LLFF dataset and reduced depth MAE from 1.66 to 0.91. When incorporated into the SDF-based NeuS model, CorresNeRF also achieves much more accurate surface reconstruction on the DTU dataset compared to previous methods like VolSDF and UNISURF. The simple yet effective technique of using correspondence supervision is shown to be widely applicable across tasks, datasets, and network architectures. Ablation studies verify the efficacy of the proposed correspondence augmentation, filtering, and loss formulations. Overall, CorresNeRF effectively addresses the challenging problem of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Training neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with sparse input views remains challenging. Existing methods rely on insufficient or ambiguous depth/geometric priors. The paper proposes to use image correspondences as stronger supervision signals for sparse-view NeRF training.  

Method: 
1) Generate dense image correspondences between input views using off-the-shelf pretrained models. Further process them via adaptive augmentation and filtering for quality and quantity.

2) Design correspondence losses to incorporate correspondences into NeRF training: 

- Pixel reprojection loss: Penalize distances between corresponding points' reprojections in 2D pixel space.

- Depth loss: Penalize relative depth differences between corresponding rays' predicted 3D points.  

Losses weighted by correspondence confidences.

3) Evaluate on both density-based and SDF-based NeRF models for novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction.


Contributions:
1) Using image correspondences as flexible strong priors to supervise sparse-view NeRF training.

2) Automatic pipeline to generate and process convincing correspondences from sparse inputs.

3) Robust correspondence losses for training, utilizing both 2D and 3D geometric relationships.

4) Experiments show consistent significant improvements over NeRF baselines across tasks and dataset. Simple plugin module that generalizes over different network backbones.
