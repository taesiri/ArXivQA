# [MMoE: Robust Spoiler Detection with Multi-modal Information and   Domain-aware Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online movie reviews often contain spoilers that reveal critical plots and diminish the viewing experience. However, detecting spoilers is challenging as existing methods rely solely on textual content, while spoilers exhibit distinct characteristics across genres. 

- Two key limitations:
    1) Relying only on textual content is inadequate. Need to integrate metadata, user profiles, etc. 
    2) Spoilers are genre-specific. Existing models fail to adapt to diverse spoiler languages across genres.

Proposed Solution - \ourmethod{}:
- Leverages multi-modal information:
    - Text features: Fine-tuned RoBERTa text encoder
    - Graph features: User-movie-review graph encoded by GAT 
    - Metadata features: Review metadata encoded by MLP

- Employs domain-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):
    - Divides reviews into domains/genres using different experts
    - Handles diversity of spoiler languages across genres

- Uses user profile extraction module:
    - Analyzes reviewer's preferences from historical reviews 
    - Learns user embedding indicating spoiler preference

- Final expert fusion via transformer fuses multi-modal embeddings  

Main Contributions:
- Novel multi-modal framework leveraging text, graph, metadata for robust spoiler detection
- Domain-aware MoE architecture to handle genre-specific spoiler languages
- User profile extraction to model reviewer preferences from historical reviews

- Achieves new SOTA results on two benchmark datasets, outperforming prior arts by 2.56-8.41% absolute gain


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-modal mixture-of-experts framework called MMoE that leverages features from review text, metadata, and user-movie graphs as well as a domain-aware mixture-of-experts layer to achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting genre-specific movie spoilers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) Proposing a multi-modal framework called MMoE that jointly leverages features from the review text, metadata, and user-movie graph to detect spoilers. This allows incorporating heterogeneous information sources for more robust spoiler detection.

2) Using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to handle genre-specific spoiler languages and divide reviews into domains, improving generalization.

3) Designing a user profile extraction module that summarizes a user's preferences from their historical reviews to aid in identifying spoiler tendencies. 

4) Achieving new state-of-the-art results on two spoiler detection benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by a large margin in terms of accuracy, AUC, and F1.

In summary, the key innovation is using multi-modal information and domain-aware MoE to enable more robust and generalizable spoiler detection, while also explicitly modeling user preferences. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach and the improvements over existing methods.
