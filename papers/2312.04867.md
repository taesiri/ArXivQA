# [HandDiffuse: Generative Controllers for Two-Hand Interactions via   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04867)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces HandDiffuse12.5M, a large-scale dataset of over 12.5 million images capturing diverse temporal sequences of human hands in strong two-hand interactions. To enable controllable generation of such interacting hand motions, the authors propose HandDiffuse, a novel diffusion-based model. HandDiffuse is conditioned on two types of control signals: discrete keyframes for motion in-betweening, and wrist trajectories for trajectory-guided generation. Two motion representations are introduced to handle these different control signals effectively. The local representation encodes the pose relative to the wrist joint, while the global encodes absolute pose. An Interaction Loss, composed of a contact potential term and shape term, is proposed to quantify and improve the realism of hand-hand interactions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on interacting hand motion generation tasks, with lower FID scores and higher diversity than recent methods. Ablations validate the benefits of the motion representations and Interaction Loss. Qualitative results showcase photorealistic motion in-betweening and trajectory-conditioned generation on the new dataset. The work represents an important step towards controllable generation of vivid virtual hand interactions.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. A large-scale dataset called HandDiffuse12.5M, which provides accurate and temporally consistent tracking of human hands under diverse and strong two-hand interactions. It contains 50-view videos, 3D keypoints, and hand poses.

2. A strong baseline method called HandDiffuse for generating interacting hand motions from various explicit controllers like keyframes and wrist trajectories. This enables applications like motion in-betweening and trajectory-based control.  

3. Two motion representations tailored for different controllers as well as an Interaction Loss to improve the quality of two-hand interaction modeling.

4. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrating the advantages of the proposed dataset and method over prior arts. The dataset and models are disseminated to the research community to facilitate future research on two-hand interaction modeling.

In summary, the main contribution is the large-scale interacting hands dataset to stimulate research on controllable two-hand motion generation, along with a strong baseline model to generate vivid hand interactions from different control signals.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating realistic and controllable motions for interacting hands is very challenging due to lack of sufficient training data and difficulties in modeling hand-hand interactions.
- Existing hands datasets have limited scale and diversity. The interactions are often weak with short range motions.
- Prior works on human motion generation focus on full body and do not address interacting hands specifically.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a large-scale interacting hands dataset called HandDiffuse12.5M with 12.5 million images.
- The dataset has 50-view videos, 3D keypoints, hand poses covering complex interactions like finger dances.
- A strong baseline called HandDiffuse is proposed for controllable motion generation using diffusion models.
- Two motion representations are used - global and local along with an Interaction Loss to model hand contacts.
- The method enables unconstrained generation, motion in-betweening given start and end frames, and trajectory control given wrist motions.

Main Contributions:
- HandDiffuse12.5M dataset with 250k frames and 12.5 million images, which is the largest available dataset for interacting hands.
- A diffusion model based baseline approach HandDiffuse for controllable motion generation of interacting hands.
- Motion representations and Interaction Loss tailored for modeling hand-hand contacts and interactions.
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the approach on tasks like motion in-betweening, trajectory control etc.
