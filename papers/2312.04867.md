# [HandDiffuse: Generative Controllers for Two-Hand Interactions via   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04867)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces HandDiffuse12.5M, a large-scale dataset of over 12.5 million images capturing diverse temporal sequences of human hands in strong two-hand interactions. To enable controllable generation of such interacting hand motions, the authors propose HandDiffuse, a novel diffusion-based model. HandDiffuse is conditioned on two types of control signals: discrete keyframes for motion in-betweening, and wrist trajectories for trajectory-guided generation. Two motion representations are introduced to handle these different control signals effectively. The local representation encodes the pose relative to the wrist joint, while the global encodes absolute pose. An Interaction Loss, composed of a contact potential term and shape term, is proposed to quantify and improve the realism of hand-hand interactions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on interacting hand motion generation tasks, with lower FID scores and higher diversity than recent methods. Ablations validate the benefits of the motion representations and Interaction Loss. Qualitative results showcase photorealistic motion in-betweening and trajectory-conditioned generation on the new dataset. The work represents an important step towards controllable generation of vivid virtual hand interactions.
