# [HandDiffuse: Generative Controllers for Two-Hand Interactions via   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04867)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces HandDiffuse12.5M, a large-scale dataset of over 12.5 million images capturing diverse temporal sequences of human hands in strong two-hand interactions. To enable controllable generation of such interacting hand motions, the authors propose HandDiffuse, a novel diffusion-based model. HandDiffuse is conditioned on two types of control signals: discrete keyframes for motion in-betweening, and wrist trajectories for trajectory-guided generation. Two motion representations are introduced to handle these different control signals effectively. The local representation encodes the pose relative to the wrist joint, while the global encodes absolute pose. An Interaction Loss, composed of a contact potential term and shape term, is proposed to quantify and improve the realism of hand-hand interactions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on interacting hand motion generation tasks, with lower FID scores and higher diversity than recent methods. Ablations validate the benefits of the motion representations and Interaction Loss. Qualitative results showcase photorealistic motion in-betweening and trajectory-conditioned generation on the new dataset. The work represents an important step towards controllable generation of vivid virtual hand interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes HandDiffuse12.5M, the largest interacting hands dataset with temporal sequences, and HandDiffuse, a strong baseline for controllable motion generation of interacting hands using diffusion models with representations tailored for trajectory control and motion inbetweening.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. A large-scale dataset called HandDiffuse12.5M, which provides accurate and temporally consistent tracking of human hands under diverse and strong two-hand interactions. It contains 50-view videos, 3D keypoints, and hand poses.

2. A strong baseline method called HandDiffuse for generating interacting hand motions from various explicit controllers like keyframes and wrist trajectories. This enables applications like motion in-betweening and trajectory-based control.  

3. Two motion representations tailored for different controllers as well as an Interaction Loss to improve the quality of two-hand interaction modeling.

4. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrating the advantages of the proposed dataset and method over prior arts. The dataset and models are disseminated to the research community to facilitate future research on two-hand interaction modeling.

In summary, the main contribution is the large-scale interacting hands dataset to stimulate research on controllable two-hand motion generation, along with a strong baseline model to generate vivid hand interactions from different control signals.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two motion representations - local representation and global representation. Can you explain the key differences between these two representations and when one might be preferred over the other? 

2. The paper introduces an Interaction Loss to model the dynamic interaction process between two hands. Can you explain the components of this loss and how it helps to reduce artifacts in the generated motions?

3. The paper demonstrates results on three tasks - unconstrained generation, motion in-betweening, and trajectory control. Can you analyze the challenges and requirements that are unique to each of these tasks? 

4. The diffusion model is used as the backbone for the proposed approach. What are some of the key advantages of diffusion models compared to other generative models like GANs and VAEs?

5. Can you analyze the limitations of directly applying existing human motion generation techniques like MDM and InterGen for interacting hand motion generation? What customizations were made in the paper to adapt them?

6. The paper introduces a new dataset called HandDiffuse12.5M. What are some of the key features of this dataset compared to prior interacting hands datasets? What gaps does it aim to address? 

7. The paper demonstrates the ability to augment existing datasets through cross-dataset evaluation. Can you explain this experiment and what it signifies about the generalizability of the proposed approach?

8. What evaluation metrics are used in the paper and why are they appropriate for this problem? Can you think of any other metrics that could provide additional insights? 

9. The concurrent work Re:InterHand is discussed in the paper. How does it compare and contrast with the HandDiffuse12.5M dataset introduced in this paper?

10. The paper focuses specifically on hand-hand interactions. Do you think the approach can be extended for full body motions involving hand-object interactions? What challenges might arise?
