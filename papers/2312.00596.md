# [BCN: Batch Channel Normalization for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00596)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN) for deep neural networks. Unlike standard Batch Normalization (BN) which normalizes along the batch dimension and Layer Normalization (LN) which normalizes along the channel dimension, BCN normalizes along both batch and channel dimensions. It first computes normalization statistics separately along the batch (N,H,W) axes and the channel (C,H,W) axes. Then it combines the normalized outputs from the two using an adaptive weight parameter to leverage benefits from both BN and LN. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate that simply replacing BN or LN with BCN leads to improved accuracy and training stability across CNN architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformers. The consistent gains validate that BCN serves as a general and effective normalization technique for deep learning. An ablation study also shows BCN alleviates issues with small batch sizes faced by BN.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN) that normalizes inputs along both the batch and channel dimensions then combines the normalized outputs adaptively to improve model generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN). Specifically:

- BCN exploits both channel and batch dimensions by separately normalizing along the (N,H,W) and (C,H,W) axes, then combining the normalized outputs adaptively using a learnable parameter. This aims to combine the benefits of Batch Normalization (BN) and Layer Normalization (LN).

- Empirically, BCN is shown to consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art normalization techniques like BN, LN, Instance Normalization (IN) and Group Normalization (GN) when applied to models like ResNet, BYOL, ViT, etc. on datasets like CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ImageNet.

- BCN also alleviates issues like BN's weakness in small batch sizes. Experiments show BCN achieves good performance even with batch sizes as small as 2 or 4.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing BCN as an effective general purpose normalization technique for neural networks, which adapts between normalizing batch and channel dimensions. Experiments demonstrate improved performance over existing techniques.
