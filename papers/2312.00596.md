# [BCN: Batch Channel Normalization for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00596)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN) for deep neural networks. Unlike standard Batch Normalization (BN) which normalizes along the batch dimension and Layer Normalization (LN) which normalizes along the channel dimension, BCN normalizes along both batch and channel dimensions. It first computes normalization statistics separately along the batch (N,H,W) axes and the channel (C,H,W) axes. Then it combines the normalized outputs from the two using an adaptive weight parameter to leverage benefits from both BN and LN. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate that simply replacing BN or LN with BCN leads to improved accuracy and training stability across CNN architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformers. The consistent gains validate that BCN serves as a general and effective normalization technique for deep learning. An ablation study also shows BCN alleviates issues with small batch sizes faced by BN.
