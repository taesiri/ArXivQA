# [Self-Improved Learning for Scalable Neural Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods struggle to scale to large problem instances with more than 1K nodes, restricting their practical applicability. The key challenges are:
1) Supervised learning-based methods rely on high-quality solution labels which are difficult to obtain for large instances. 
2) Reinforcement learning-based methods suffer from sparse rewards and high computational costs during training.
3) Attempts to train on small instances and generalize to larger ones have limited success beyond 10K nodes.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a Self-Improved Learning (SIL) method to enable direct training of NCO models on large problem instances with up to 100K nodes without any labeled data. The key ideas are:

1) Local Reconstruction: Iteratively reconstruct parts of a solution to improve quality. The enhanced solutions serve as pseudo-labels to guide model training.

2) Model Training: Train model to mimic local reconstruction behavior and improve its capability. The improved model can further boost local reconstruction performance.

Through iterative local-reconstruction-model-training loops, SIL allows continuous self-improvement to tackle large instances.

Additionally, a linear complexity attention mechanism is designed to reduce computational costs for large problems.


Main Contributions:
1) A self-improving learning approach for scalable training of NCO models on problems with up to 100K nodes without labeled data.

2) A linear attention mechanism to significantly decrease computational complexity for large-scale training and inference.

3) State-of-the-art performance on large TSP and CVRP benchmarks with up to 100K nodes on both uniform and real-world distributions, demonstrating superior scalability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-improved learning method that enables neural combinatorial optimization models to be directly trained on large-scale problem instances without labeled data by iteratively generating better solutions as pseudo-labels to guide efficient model training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel Self-Improved Learning (SIL) method for scalable neural combinatorial optimization to solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with up to 100K nodes. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Developing an efficient self-improved learning method that enables neural combinatorial optimization models to be directly trained on large-scale problem instances without any labeled data. 

2) Designing a linear complexity attention mechanism for the neural combinatorial optimization models to handle large-scale problems, which significantly reduces the computational cost for both model training and inference.

3) Conducting comprehensive experiments on both randomly generated and real-world Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) benchmarks with up to 100K nodes. The results demonstrate the superior scalability and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed SIL method.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the SIL method to achieve scalable neural combinatorial optimization that can solve problems with up to 100K nodes, through an iterative self-improving process and a efficient linear attention mechanism.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) - Using neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems like vehicle routing and traveling salesman.

- Self-improved learning (SIL) - The proposed method where the model iteratively improves itself by using its own solutions to generate better pseudo-labels for more training.  

- Local reconstruction - The process of iteratively improving parts of a solution to get better overall solutions. Used in SIL to get pseudo-labels.

- Scalability - A key focus of the paper is developing methods that can solve large problem instances with up to 100k nodes, much bigger than prior NCO methods.  

- Linear attention - A novel attention mechanism is proposed that reduces the quadratic computation and memory costs of standard attention, improving scalability.

- Traveling salesman problem (TSP) - A classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem used as a testbed.

- Capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) - Another routing optimization problem with capacity constraints, used as a test problem.

- Pseudo-labels - Approximate or estimated labels generated to train the model, used due to lack of true solutions for large problems.

The key innovation is using the iterative SIL technique powered by local reconstruction to achieve scalability up to 100k nodes for NCO. The linear attention mechanism also helps improve efficiency.
