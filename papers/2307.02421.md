# [DragonDiffusion: Enabling Drag-style Manipulation on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable fine-grained image editing capabilities like drag-style manipulation on diffusion models. Specifically, the paper investigates utilizing the strong correspondence between intermediate image features in diffusion models to transform editing signals into gradients that can modify the diffusion process. The key hypothesis is that the intermediate feature correspondence can facilitate various precise image editing tasks without requiring model fine-tuning.The paper proposes a method called DragonDiffusion that uses classifier guidance based on feature correspondence loss to edit the intermediate representations in a diffusion model. The goal is to leverage the text-to-image generation capabilities of diffusion models for fine-grained image editing tasks like object moving, resizing, appearance replacement, and content dragging. The central hypothesis is that the strong intermediate feature correspondence in diffusion models can enable precise control over editing while preserving content consistency, without extra model training.In summary, the key research question is how to enable diverse drag-style image editing capabilities on diffusion models by exploiting intermediate feature correspondence, without model fine-tuning. The central hypothesis is that feature correspondence can transform editing signals to gradients that modify diffusion representations to achieve precise control.
