# [Disentangled 3D Scene Generation with Layout Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16936)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating 3D scenes from text prompts is an important capability, but most existing text-to-3D methods produce scenes consisting of a single 3D representation that cannot easily be manipulated at the object level. The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a method that can generate complex 3D scenes that are disentangled into separate 3D representations for each object.

Method:
The key idea is to optimize multiple neural radiance fields (NeRFs) jointly, where each NeRF represents a different object in the scene. In addition, the method learns a set of "layouts" which define arrangements of the NeRFs to form valid scene compositions. Specifically:

- The method instantiates K NeRFs, expecting each one to represent a different object. 

- Each NeRF has an associated affine transform (rotation, translation, scale) that places it in the scene. The set of transforms across NeRFs is called a "layout".

- Multiple layouts are learned, by initializing several layouts and sampling one per training iteration. This encourages objects to work across arrangements.

- The NeRF scene representations are transformed by the layout, composited into a single scene, and rendered. The rendered image is scored by a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model using score matching.

- Various regularizations are used to prevent degenerate solutions, like empty NeRFs.

By requiring objects to function across layouts, the method causes each NeRF to represent a coherent object rather than a random piece of the scene. No extra supervision is needed besides the text-to-image diffusion model.

Results:
The method is able to generate complex 3D scenes disentangled into separate object NeRFs for a variety of text prompts. It also enables applications like placing external 3D assets into generated scenes and decomposing existing NeRFs into constituent objects. Quantitatively, the emergent decomposition scores well on a NeRF-caption matching task.

Contributions:
1) A simple yet effective definition of objects as parts of a scene that can be validly rearranged
2) Incorporating this notion into a neural 3D generative model via layout learning 
3) Achieving unsupervised disentanglement of complex 3D scene generation using only text conditioning
