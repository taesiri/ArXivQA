# [Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods require hundreds or thousands of sampling steps during inference, limiting their efficiency for real applications. Although some acceleration techniques have been proposed, they sacrifice performance, leading to over-smooth results. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient diffusion model tailored for IR that achieves a balance between inference speed and restoration quality.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model called "ResShift" that facilitates the transition between a high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) image pair. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a short Markov chain between the HQ and LQ images rather than Gaussian noise, enabling fast iterative recovery of the HQ image from the LQ one. 

2) Design the transition kernel to gradually shift the residual information between the HQ/LQ pair over a few steps. This substantially improves transition efficiency.

3) Develop a flexible noise schedule that controls the shifting speed and noise strength during diffusion. This allows fidelity-realism trade-off tuning.  

4) Incorporate perceptual loss to constrain the solution space and enable model acceleration to just 4 steps without performance drop.

5) Substitute self-attention layers with Swin Transformers for handling arbitrary resolutions.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose an efficient diffusion model needing only 4 steps while achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on image super-resolution and inpainting.

2) Design a Markov chain between HQ/LQ images and residual-shifting transition kernel, enhancing efficiency. 

3) Develop a controllable noise schedule for precisely steering the diffusion process.

4) Demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model as a general IR framework, validating it on diverse tasks like super-resolution, inpainting and blind face restoration.

In summary, this paper puts forth an efficient diffusion model to address the limitation of existing methods on inference speed without compromising restoration quality. Extensive experiments verify its effectiveness across various image restoration tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient diffusion model for image restoration that achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with only 4 sampling steps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an efficient diffusion model specifically tailored for image restoration (IR) that requires very few (4) sampling steps during inference to achieve strong performance. This is enabled by constructing a Markov chain between the high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) image pairs rather than between the HQ image and Gaussian noise as done in prior diffusion models. 

2. It designs a highly flexible noise schedule to control the shifting speed and noise strength during diffusion, allowing tuning of the fidelity-realism trade-off in the results.

3. It demonstrates the general applicability of the proposed diffusion framework on three challenging IR tasks - image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration. Extensive experiments substantiate its superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and performance.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient diffusion model for image restoration that requires very few sampling steps (4) during inference while achieving strong performance across diverse tasks. This is enabled by a Markov chain between the HQ/LQ pairs and a flexible noise schedule.
