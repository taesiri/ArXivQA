# [Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods require hundreds or thousands of sampling steps during inference, limiting their efficiency for real applications. Although some acceleration techniques have been proposed, they sacrifice performance, leading to over-smooth results. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient diffusion model tailored for IR that achieves a balance between inference speed and restoration quality.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model called "ResShift" that facilitates the transition between a high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) image pair. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a short Markov chain between the HQ and LQ images rather than Gaussian noise, enabling fast iterative recovery of the HQ image from the LQ one. 

2) Design the transition kernel to gradually shift the residual information between the HQ/LQ pair over a few steps. This substantially improves transition efficiency.

3) Develop a flexible noise schedule that controls the shifting speed and noise strength during diffusion. This allows fidelity-realism trade-off tuning.  

4) Incorporate perceptual loss to constrain the solution space and enable model acceleration to just 4 steps without performance drop.

5) Substitute self-attention layers with Swin Transformers for handling arbitrary resolutions.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose an efficient diffusion model needing only 4 steps while achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on image super-resolution and inpainting.

2) Design a Markov chain between HQ/LQ images and residual-shifting transition kernel, enhancing efficiency. 

3) Develop a controllable noise schedule for precisely steering the diffusion process.

4) Demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model as a general IR framework, validating it on diverse tasks like super-resolution, inpainting and blind face restoration.

In summary, this paper puts forth an efficient diffusion model to address the limitation of existing methods on inference speed without compromising restoration quality. Extensive experiments verify its effectiveness across various image restoration tasks.
