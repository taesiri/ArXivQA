# [WildFusion: Learning 3D-Aware Latent Diffusion Models in View Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13570)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes WildFusion, a novel approach for 3D-aware image synthesis that does not require posed images or learned camera pose distributions. Instead, it models instances in view space from the observer's perspective. A two-stage pipeline is used. First, a 3D-aware autoencoder is trained to perform compression while enabling novel view synthesis by learning a triplane scene representation. Monocular depth prediction provides additional 3D supervision. Second, a latent diffusion model is trained in the autoencoder's latent space to enable high-quality and diverse 3D-consistent image generation. Experiments on complex datasets like ImageNet demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and geometry while avoiding mode collapse. Unlike prior GAN-based approaches, the diffusion modeling framework ensures sample diversity. By removing assumptions on canonical poses, WildFusion takes an important step towards scalable and robust 3D-aware generative modeling for in-the-wild images.

The paper proposes WildFusion, a new approach for 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models, which trains an autoencoder to learn a compressed 3D-aware latent space from unposed images and then fits a diffusion model on this latent space, enabling high-quality and diverse 3D-consistent image generation without relying on canonical pose distributions or multiview supervision.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes WildFusion, a novel approach to 3D-aware image synthesis that is based on latent diffusion models (LDMs) and does not require posed images or learned camera pose distributions during training. A key innovation is modeling objects in view space instead of assuming a shared canonical coordinate system. An autoencoder is first trained to compress images into a 3D-aware latent space suitable for novel view synthesis, using adversarial training and cues from monocular depth prediction for supervision. This autoencoder simultaneously performs compression and novel view synthesis without direct multiview supervision. Next, a diffusion model is trained in this compressed 3D-aware latent space, enabling high-quality and diverse 3D-consistent image synthesis. Experiments across complex image datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to recent 3D-aware GAN models. The ability to train without relying on canonical coordinate systems or pose estimation unlocks scaling 3D-aware generative modeling to diverse in-the-wild image collections.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models, which does not require posed images or learned camera distributions and can generate high-quality, diverse samples with reasonable geometry when trained on complex, non-aligned image datasets.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is:

How can we develop a scalable and robust framework for 3D-aware image synthesis that works on diverse, in-the-wild datasets without requiring posed images or learned camera pose distributions?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Modeling instances in view space instead of a shared canonical space will remove the need for posed images or learned camera distributions, making the approach more scalable to in-the-wild datasets. 

2) Diffusion model-based frameworks will be more robust for this setting than GANs and achieve better distribution coverage and sample diversity.

3) An autoencoder can be trained to simultaneously perform compression and enable novel view synthesis from unposed images, which then allows training an efficient latent diffusion model for 3D-aware image synthesis in the second stage.

4) Additional cues from monocular depth prediction can help the autoencoder learn a reasonable 3D representation suitable for novel view synthesis, without requiring direct multiview supervision.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a 3D-aware image synthesis framework that works on complex in-the-wild datasets without relying on posed images or camera models, which existing state-of-the-art GAN-based techniques depend on. The core hypotheses center around modeling instances in view space, using diffusion models instead of GANs, and leveraging an autoencoder with monocular depth cues to enable the key capabilities needed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(i) Removing the need for posed images and a priori camera pose distributions for 3D-aware image synthesis by modeling instances in view space instead of canonical space. 

(ii) Learning a powerful 3D-aware autoencoder from unposed images without multiview supervision that simultaneously performs compression, while inferring a 3D representation suitable for novel-view synthesis.

(iii) Showing that their novel 3D-aware latent diffusion model, called WildFusion, enables high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis with reasonable geometry and strong distribution coverage, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the unposed image training setting (which corresponds to training on in-the-wild image data).

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new 3D-aware generative model called WildFusion based on latent diffusion models, which can be trained on unposed in-the-wild images and achieves improved performance over previous GAN-based methods in this setting. Key aspects are removing the need for explicit camera poses or distributions and using cues from monocular depth prediction to learn a good 3D representation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). Here is a summary of how it compares to other related work:

- Most prior work on 3D-aware image synthesis uses GANs and represents objects in a shared canonical space. This requires posed images or learned camera pose distributions, which is difficult for complex in-the-wild datasets. This paper instead models objects in view space without needing poses or pose distributions.

- The proposed WildFusion framework trains a 3D-aware autoencoder first to enable novel view synthesis and compression. A latent diffusion model is then trained on the autoencoder's latent space for full generative capabilities. Other recent works have explored novel view synthesis with autoencoders, but not for generative modeling.

- Concurrent work IVID trains a 2D diffusion model to generate views iteratively, which is slow. WildFusion instead learns an explicit 3D representation to render views directly. Other concurrent work VQ3D uses an autoencoder but with different architecture choices.

- Experiments show WildFusion outperforms recent state-of-the-art 3D-aware GANs like EG3D, 3DGP, and POF3D when training on complex datasets without poses. It produces higher quality images and geometry. The GAN baselines struggle with distribution coverage unlike the diffusion framework.

- On ImageNet, WildFusion generates more diverse high-quality samples compared to the mode collapsed 3DGP GAN. This demonstrates the advantage of diffusion models on complex diverse data.

In summary, WildFusion sets a new state-of-the-art for in-the-wild 3D-aware image synthesis without relying on canonical pose systems, using a novel combination of autoencoders and latent diffusion models. It outperforms concurrent and prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions, including:

1) Scaling up 3D-aware latent diffusion models to the text-conditional setting, similar to how 2D diffusion models have been applied on extremely diverse datasets.

2) Increasing the viewpoint range that the model can synthesize novel views for, potentially enabling full 360 degree novel view synthesis. However, generating realistic content for largely unobserved regions that become visible after large viewpoint changes poses a challenge. 

3) Addressing occasional plane-like geometry artifacts in the synthesized samples, which may be due to the autoencoder's reconstruction loss favoring simple copying of the image across triplanes.

4) Potentially learning the camera intrinsics in the model instead of using fixed intrinsics.

In summary, the main future directions suggested are scaling up the model's capabilities in terms of conditioning, viewpoint range, avoiding geometry artifacts, and learning intrinsics.

3) What role does the additional monocular depth prediction network play in the training process? How exactly is the predicted depth used to provide supervision signals? What impact did this have on the learned latent representation?

4) The decoder predicts a 3D feature field using a triplane representation. How is this representation constructed from the 2D latent feature map? What is the motivation behind using transformer blocks in combination with convolutional layers?

5) The paper mentions using a contraction function to map sampling coordinates to bounded triplane coordinates when modeling unbounded scenes. Explain the purpose and specifics of this contraction function.  

6) During autoencoder training, what are the main differences between the reconstruction losses applied on the input view versus the adversarial losses used to supervise novel views? What are the motivations behind this combination?
