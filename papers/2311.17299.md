# [Federated Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Probabilistic Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17299)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces \method, a novel federated learning approach to efficiently fine-tune large foundation models under stringent communication constraints. \method employs stochastic binary masks over the frozen parameters of foundation models to identify highly performing subnetworks. It combines these masks with lightweight probabilistic filters to compress mask updates into compact bitstreams, communicated as grayscale images between clients and server. Notably, \method achieves bitrates as low as 0.09 bits per parameter, significantly lower than existing schemes like gradient quantization or prior mask-based methods. Experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate \method's effectiveness in adapting foundation models to downstream tasks in federated settings with up to 9x communication savings, without compromising accuracy. The method capitalizes on the inherent sparsity in mask changes to transmit only essential updates ranked by relative entropy. This allows reconstructing clients' masks on the server via membership queries. By eschewing full model transmission, \method enables deploying extensive foundation models with billions of parameters to edge devices, unlocking their representation power for collaborative learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a federated learning method called DeltaMask that efficiently fine-tunes foundation models using stochastic masking and probabilistic filters to achieve ultra-low communication bitrates below 0.1 bits per parameter.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel method called DeltaMask to efficiently fine-tune foundation models in federated learning settings with significantly reduced communication costs. Specifically, the key highlights are:

1) It employs stochastic masking to detect highly effective subnetworks within foundation models and leverage stochasticity and sparsity in client masks to compress updates into a compact grayscale image using probabilistic filters. This deviates from traditional weight training approaches. 

2) Comprehensive evaluations across various datasets and architectures demonstrate DeltaMask efficiently achieves bitrates as low as 0.09 bits-per-parameter, enhancing communication efficiency while maintaining foundation models' performance. Experiments are conducted on 8 datasets and 5 pre-trained models with various network architectures.

3) The method combines stochastic masking with probabilistic filters to find high-performing subnetworks within pre-trained foundation models, while operating at an ultra-low bitrate regime. This enables fine-tuning foundation models in federated settings without the massive communication burden caused by their large number of parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an efficient and communication-constrained method to fine-tune foundation models in federated learning by combining stochastic masking and probabilistic filters.

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Foundation Models (FMs): The paper focuses on adapting large pre-trained models like CLIP and DINO for efficient federated learning. These models are referred to as Foundation Models.

- Federated Learning (FL): The distributed training paradigm where models are trained collaboratively across clients while keeping data decentralized. The paper aims to enable fine-tuning of FMs in this setting. 

- Stochastic Masking: Learning sparse binary masks over the parameters of foundation models to identify performant subnetworks. Masks are sampled from an underlying probability distribution.

- Probabilistic Filters: Specifically binary fuse filters, used to compactly encode the mask updates between clients and server during federated training. Help achieve ultra low bitrates.

- Top-k Ranking: Prioritizing certain mask updates over others based on the relative entropy between client and server masks. Brings notions of importance sampling.

- Bits per Parameter (bpp): Key metric measuring communication efficiency in terms of the average number of bits exchanged per parameter of the model. Paper demonstrates bpp below 0.1.

- Bayesian Aggregation: Technique to aggregate client masks on the server while accounting for varying participation rates. Helps model convergence.

In summary, the core focus is enabling communication-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in federated learning using concepts like stochastic masking and probabilistic filters.
