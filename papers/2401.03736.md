# [Lessons Learned: Reproducibility, Replicability, and When to Stop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is extensive guidance on ensuring reproducibility of one's own research, but little on reproducing or replicating others' work when incorporating it into new research. This can impact the claims made based on that prior work.

- The authors encountered challenges trying to reproduce an operational tropical cyclone formation forecasting model to use as a baseline for comparing new machine learning approaches. This motivated developing guidance on evaluating reproduction/replication.

Proposed Solution:
- A 2D framework with "fitting" and "inference" axes for assessing reproduction/replication confidence based on equivalence of datasets, metrics, and models. 

- Propose typical "trajectories" through the framework in research projects and how position indicates claims that can be made.

- A questionnaire to empirically evaluate position on the axes.

- Show framework can indicate utility of benchmark datasets with consistent data/metrics/baselines for starting in high reproduction confidence.

Key Contributions:

- A novel framework and questionnaire for evaluating and guiding efforts at reproducing/replicating prior work to inform claims made based on that work.

- Perspective on challenges with reproducing complex operational models instead of published research algorithms. 

- Demonstrate framework usefulness on their case study and for indicating benchmark dataset advantages for reproducible research.

In summary, the key innovation is a 2D framework and questionnaire to assess reproduction/replication of prior works incorporated into new studies, to better inform claims made from that research incorporation. Their framework codifies practices promoting robust science.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a two-dimensional framework for assessing the reproducibility and replicability of previous work incorporated into new research, in order to guide claims made based on the new study.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-dimensional framework to help researchers assess the level of reproducibility and replicability of previous work that they incorporate into their own research. 

Specifically, the framework has two axes:

1) The "Fitting" axis evaluates the concordance in dataset, metrics, and parameters used for model training compared to the original study. This represents the ability to reproduce the model fitting process.

2) The "Inference" axis assesses the alignment in dataset, metrics and parameters used for model evaluation. This represents the ability to replicate the model evaluation process. 

By mapping the trajectory of their research onto these axes, researchers can better gauge the extent of reproduction and replication achieved and determine what claims can be justified in light of the original study. 

The paper also shows how this framework can highlight the value of benchmark datasets in facilitating reproduction and replication, and uses a case study of trying to improve an operational cyclogenesis prediction model to demonstrate typical research trajectories.

Overall, the two-dimensional framework and questionnaire provide researchers with tools to incorporate prior work into their own research rigorously and inform the types of claims they can make. This addresses a perceived lack of guidance on quantifying reproduction and replication of others' work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Reproducibility - Obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.

- Replicability - Obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.  

- Fitting - The process of training a model on a dataset, which involves selecting hyperparameters and optimizing trainable parameters. 

- Inference - Using a fitted model to make predictions on new data in order to evaluate model performance.

- Benchmark datasets - Standardized datasets that facilitate reproduction and replication by providing consistent data, baseline implementations, and evaluation protocols.

- Two-dimensional framework - The proposed method for assessing replication that has one axis representing fidelity of model fitting and another axis representing fidelity of model inference procedures. 

- Model trajectories - Typical paths taken during research projects with respect to the two-dimensional framework, showing progress in reproducing and extending prior work.

- Scientific claims - Conclusions that can be justifiably made based on the level of reproduction and replication achieved.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-dimensional framework for assessing replication efforts. What are the two axes representing and how do they capture the key aspects of replication?

2. The framework includes a questionnaire to help researchers evaluate their position on the two axes. What types of questions are included and how do they quantify reproducibility and replicability? 

3. The paper describes typical trajectories for research projects on the proposed framework. Can you explain one of those trajectories in depth and what it indicates about the project?

4. How exactly does the framework help inform the types of claims that can be made from a research project, according to the authors? Can you provide a detailed example? 

5. The authors argue benchmark datasets provide advantages when using the framework. Can you explain the specific ways benchmark datasets facilitate positioning on the axes?

6. The case study in the paper aimed to apply modern ML to tropical cyclone formation prediction. What were the key complications and obstacles faced in trying to reproduce the base study?

7. Take the case study and map out its trajectory on the proposed two-dimensional framework. Explain each segment of the trajectory and how it relates to the case study details.  

8. The paper states the framework does not quantify model quality, only reproducibility and replicability confidence. Why is this an important limitation to note and what do the authors suggest to complement the framework?

9. The framework axes focus on fitting and inference. What are some of the key hyperparameter types and model components that differ between fitting and inference?

10. How could the proposed framework specifically help with decision making during the model development process? Explain with regards to iterations, resource allocation, and determining next steps.
