# [Runtime Analysis of the SMS-EMOA for Many-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper analyzes the performance of the SMS-EMOA algorithm for many-objective optimization problems. The SMS-EMOA is a variant of the popular NSGA-II algorithm where the secondary selection criterion is based on hypervolume contribution instead of crowding distance. Previous work has shown that NSGA-II struggles with many objectives, while SMS-EMOA performs well empirically. However, no rigorous runtime analyses existed for SMS-EMOA in the many-objective setting.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. The paper proposes the mOJZJ benchmark, a many-objective generalization of the bi-objective OJZJ problem. This is the first multimodal many-objective benchmark problem rigorously analyzed.

2. It is proven that SMS-EMOA can optimize the mOJZJ problem in O(M^2 n^k) iterations, where M is the Pareto front size, n is the problem size, and k is the "gap size" parameter. Together with the existing negative results for NSGA-II, this suggests the general NSGA-II approach works with many objectives, but crowding distance specifically struggles.

3. For SMS-EMOA with a stochastic population update previously analyzed in the bi-objective case, the paper shows reduced benefits in the many-objective setting, giving only a O(1) speedup when the number of objectives is sufficiently high.  

4. It is proven SMS-EMOA with heavy-tailed mutation gives a speedup of k^(k+0.5−β) on mOJZJ, matching the speedup known for 1 and 2 objectives. This is the first analysis showing heavy-tailed mutation benefits for >2 objectives.

5. Runtime analyses are provided for SMS-EMOA on the classic bi-objective LOTZ and COCZ problems, showing its performance matches existing algorithms like GSEMO and NSGA-II.

In summary, the paper provides the first rigorous analyses of SMS-EMOA for many-objective optimization, isolating the issues with NSGA-II's crowding distance, while also analyzing algorithm variants like stochastic update and heavy-tailed mutation. The proposed mOJZJ benchmark facilitates future theoretical studies.
