# [One-shot Neural Face Reenactment via Finding Directions in GAN's Latent   Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Neural face reenactment aims to transfer the head pose and facial expression from a target image to a source image. Existing methods rely on training complex neural networks from scratch to disentangle identity and pose/expression. However, training such networks is difficult and often leads to suboptimal quality. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework for neural face reenactment using pre-trained StyleGAN. The key idea is to discover semantic directions in StyleGAN's latent space that control pose and expression by utilizing a pretrained 3D face model. Specifically:

1) A fine-tuned StyleGAN generator is used to synthesize high-quality facial images.

2) A pretrained 3D Morphable Face Model is used to extract disentangled pose and expression parameters from real/synthetic images. 

3) A directions matrix is trained to map changes in pose/expression parameters to semantic latent directions that control the corresponding variations in StyleGAN's generations.

4) For real image editing, an optimization-free encoder is jointly trained to invert images into StyleGAN's space.

5) StyleGAN's feature space is further refined to improve inversion quality.

Main Contributions:

- Bypasses pose/expression disentanglement by discovering semantic directions in pre-trained GANs. Enables high-quality neural face reenactment using a simple pipeline.

- Allows reenactment from a single source image, without the need for subject-specific fine-tuning.

- Jointly trains an encoder for real image inversion, enabling optimization-free editing at test time.

- Refines StyleGANâ€™s feature space to further improve inversion/editing quality. 

- Extensive comparisons show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, qualitatively and quantitatively on challenging datasets like VoxCeleb.

In summary, this paper presents a simple and effective approach for high-quality neural face reenactment by discovering semantic directions in the latent space of pre-trained GANs. The approach demonstrates compelling results while avoiding complex disentanglement training.
