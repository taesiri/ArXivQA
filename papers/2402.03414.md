# [An end-to-end deep learning pipeline to derive blood input with partial   volume corrections for automated parametric brain PET mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dynamic FDG-PET brain imaging has high clinical potential but its use is limited due to the need for invasive arterial blood sampling to derive the blood input function. This is costly, risks infection/arterial occlusion, and requires manual segmentation of carotid arteries which is time-consuming.  

- Raw image-derived blood input functions (IDIFs) from carotid arteries are impacted by partial volume (PV) and spillover (SP) effects which require correction. Prior methods for model-based correction require manual optimization and parameter bounds.

Proposed Solution:
- An end-to-end deep learning pipeline to automate ICA segmentation and compute a model-corrected blood input function (MCIF) with PV/SP correction.

- Uses a 3D U-Net (ICA-net) to segment Internal Carotid Arteries (ICA). Combines Dice and Binary Cross Entropy loss to handle class imbalance and provide robust gradients. 

- Employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based MCIF-net to predict MCIF from IDIF, using LSTM and Bidirectional GRU layers to capture temporal patterns.

Contributions:
- ICA-net achieves 82.18% Dice score in segmenting ICA, significantly enhancing efficiency.

- MCIF-net demonstrates high accuracy in predicting MCIF with minimal errors (MSE of 0.0052), enabling precise PV/SP correction.

- End-to-end pipeline validated on epilepsy cases accurately identifies seizure onset regions, matched to ground truth. Led to successful clinical outcome of seizure-free state in one patient.

- Overall, the pipeline automates the analysis of dynamic FDG-PET scans, eliminating the need for invasive blood sampling, with high accuracy. Marks a major advance in non-invasive neuroimaging.
