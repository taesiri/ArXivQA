# [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Community Battery Scheduling under   Uncertainties of Load, PV Generation, and Energy Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper studies the scheduling of community batteries in residential areas to optimize operations amidst uncertainties in solar PV generation, load demand, and energy prices. Effective scheduling strategies are critical to unlock the value of community batteries in integrating renewable energy, reducing peak loads, and providing grid services. However, existing optimization methods have limitations dealing with uncertainties. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based approach using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to schedule the charge and discharge of the community battery under uncertainties. Specifically, the SAC algorithm utilizes a stochastic policy and maximum entropy framework to enhance exploration during RL training. Additionally, a noisy network is incorporated into SAC to further improve exploration and accelerate convergence to better policies.  

The scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process. The state contains battery status and exogeneous information like prices and load. The action determines the battery's charging/discharging power and grid interactions. The reward aims to minimize system cost and penalty for constraint violations. Comparative studies are conducted with optimization, DDPG and PPO algorithms.

Main Contributions:
- Uses RL to schedule community battery amidst uncertainties in PV, load and prices to reduce cost  
- Employs SAC algorithm and noisy network to improve exploration and convergence for better policies
- Formulates community battery scheduling as Markov decision process  
- Comparative study demonstrates superior performance of SAC over benchmarks in cost and constraint management

In summary, this paper presents an effective data-driven RL approach using SAC to schedule community batteries under uncertainties for optimized operations and economics. The results highlight RL's potential in community battery applications.
