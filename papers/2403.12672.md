# [Improving Interpretability of Scores in Anomaly Detection Based on   Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs) are often used for semi-supervised anomaly detection where they are trained on only normal data points. 
- In GBRBM-based anomaly detection, data points are classified as normal or anomalous based on a "free energy (FE) score". However, it is difficult to set an appropriate threshold on this score to classify points accurately.

Proposed Solutions:
1. Develop a measure based on the cumulative distribution of FE scores to give a probabilistic interpretation of anomaly, allowing guidelines for setting classification threshold using only normal data. 

2. Propose a method to evaluate the minimum FE score, which is needed to calculate the cumulative distribution, using simulated annealing. This also finds the data point corresponding to the minimum score.

Main Contributions:
- A measure based on the cumulative distribution of FE scores that facilitates interpretability of the scores and enables guidelines for setting classification threshold in anomaly detection using only normal data

- A simulated annealing-based method to evaluate the difficult-to-calculate minimum FE score needed for the cumulative distribution measure. This method is faster than a previous technique and also finds the data point yielding the minimum score.

- Experiments on toy and real-world datasets that demonstrate the ability of the guidelines to set reasonable classification thresholds for anomaly detection. The proposed method for minimum FE score evaluation also showed improved performance over the baseline.
