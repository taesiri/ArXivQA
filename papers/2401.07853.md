# [VeCAF: VLM-empowered Collaborative Active Finetuning with Training   Objective Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Fine-tuning a pretrained vision model (PVM) on a downstream task is a common technique, but conventional finetuning with randomly sampled data can be inefficient. The paper aims to address this issue by actively selecting an optimal subset from the training data to accelerate convergence towards a user-specified performance target.

Proposed Method: 
The paper proposes VeCAF - a VLM-empowered Collaborative Active Finetuning framework with training objective awareness. Key aspects are:

1) Objective-aware Data Selection (ODS): A parameterized model selects a subset by modeling the training data distribution reweighted by the loss to focus on informative samples. Diversity regularization avoids overfitting.

2) Cross-attentive Embedding Augmentation (CEA): Uses vision-language model (VLM) to generate captions for images. Text embeddings of captions are used to augment image embeddings via an attention mechanism. This enriches semantic information to aid selection and finetuning.

3) Handles out-of-distribution scenarios: Can modify image captions to highlight domain characteristics, guiding selection of useful training samples.


Main Contributions:

1) Proposes VeCAF framework for efficient PVM finetuning by active data selection aware of target performance objective.

2) Introduces ODS method to select subset that accelerates convergence by matching reweighted data distribution.

3) Leverages VLM knowledge via CEA method to augment image embeddings with semantic information from text. 

4) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and efficiency gains over baselines on CIFAR-10, Caltech101 and ImageNet across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.


The summary covers the key problem definition, components of the method, and major contributions made in the paper. It highlights how VeCAF actively selects data matching the objective for efficient finetuning while exploiting vision-language connections to handle out-of-distribution scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new active learning method called VeCAF that selects the most informative subset from a labeled dataset to efficiently finetune a pretrained vision model towards a user-specified performance target, by optimizing a parametric data selection model incorporating the training objective and utilizing text embeddings from a pretrained vision-language model to augment image features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a novel framework called VeCAF (VLM-empowered Collaborative Active Finetuning) to improve the finetuning efficiency of pretrained vision models (PVMs) using both the training objective and knowledge from pretrained vision-language models (VLMs).

2. It proposes an Objective-aware Data Selection (ODS) method, where a parameterized model selects a subset of data that contributes to faster convergence towards a target training objective. 

3. It explores the visual understanding and language expression capabilities of VLMs through a Cross-attentive Embedding Augmentation (CEA) technique. CEA enriches the semantic information in image features using alignments with text embeddings from the VLM, providing guidance for data selection and finetuning.

In summary, the key contribution is the VeCAF framework and its components ODS and CEA that leverage VLMs to actively select optimal and informative subsets from labeled data to efficiently finetune PVMs. Experiments show VeCAF's superior performance and efficiency in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution image classification scenarios.
