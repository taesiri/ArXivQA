# [Harnessing the Synergy between Pushing, Grasping, and Throwing to   Enhance Object Manipulation in Cluttered Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robotic manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging as it requires a synergy between non-prehensile actions like pushing and prehensile actions like grasping and throwing. This is critical for efficiently singulating and manipulating target objects.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces an innovative approach to learn the synergies between pushing, grasping and throwing via model-free deep reinforcement learning. 
- The workflow involves detecting object poses, predicting optimal push parameters to isolate the target object, determining appropriate grasp configuration, and inferring necessary throw parameters into a basket.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneers in integrating pushing, grasping and throwing to enhance robot object manipulation capabilities in clutter.
- Learned policies effectively transfer from simulation to real robots, showcasing generalization.  
- Adopted a modular training approach for easier troubleshooting and updates without impacting the whole system.
- Reduced need for extensive data collection compared to end-to-end training.
- Achieved success rates exceeding 80% in both simulation and real robot experiments.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards enabling robots to skillfully reconfigure cluttered environments through pushing actions to create space for collision-free grasps. Furthermore, the integration of throwing actions greatly extends the robot's operational reach. The modular training approach and extensive experiments validate the practical applicability of this method.
