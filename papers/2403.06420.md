## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "RLingua: Improving Reinforcement Learning Sample Efficiency in Robotic Manipulations With Large Language Models":

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving robotic manipulation tasks, but suffers from low sample efficiency. Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive prior knowledge that could help address this limitation, but directly using LLMs to generate robot controllers can result in poor performance. This paper explores how to leverage LLMs to improve RL sample efficiency in robotic tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose RLingua, a framework to extract rule-based controllers from LLMs through prompt engineering and use them to guide RL exploration. Specifically:

1) Prompt design methods (with human feedback or code templates) are introduced to obtain preliminary, imperfect controllers from LLMs like GPT-4. These sequence low-level actions but may fail to fully capture environment dynamics.  

2) The LLM controllers generate demonstration samples to prefill RL replay buffers. A modified actor-critic RL loss regularizes policy learning towards the LLM controller, while allowing compensation for its imperfections. An annealing schedule transfers control from LLM to learned policy.

3) RLingua refines the capabilities of imperfect LLM controllers through the RL process.

Main Contributions:

- A novel prompt engineering approach to extract rule-based robot controllers from LLMs, requiring only high-level task specs.

- Using LLM controllers for guided exploration that significantly enhances RL sample efficiency.

- Validation of RLingua on robotic tasks with sparse rewards, where it reduces sample complexity and achieves higher success rates than standard RL.

- Demonstration of Sim2Real transferability through real robot experiments on learned policies.

In summary, RLingua provides an effective framework to leverage LLMs' knowledge to address RL sample inefficiency in robotic manipulations. Both simulated and real robot results highlight the promise of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

RLingua is a framework that leverages large language models to generate imperfect rule-based robot controllers, which are then used to guide reinforcement learning and significantly reduce the sample complexity in robotic manipulation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

i) It introduces a method to generate rule-based controllers through LLM prompts, enabling robots to perform high-level tasks by executing low-level actions sequentially. The paper presents two prompt design methods, one with human feedback and another using a code template.

ii) The paper proposes a framework called RLingua that utilizes the LLM-generated imperfect controllers to collect demonstration data and guide the explorations of RL algorithms. This is shown to significantly reduce the number of samples needed for effective RL in robotic tasks. 

iii) The paper validates RLingua's effectiveness in various robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, demonstrating notable reductions in sample complexity and high success rates. It also shows the transferability of the learned policies to real robots through Sim2Real experiments.

In summary, the key innovation is using LLMs to extract prior knowledge about robot motions and coding to accelerate RL, overcoming its limitations like sample inefficiency. RLingua also provides a way to refine the imperfect LLM-generated controllers.
