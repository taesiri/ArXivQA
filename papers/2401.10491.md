# [Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is extremely expensive and often results in models with redundant capabilities. 
- Existing pre-trained LLMs have unique strengths and weaknesses. 
- Directly blending LLM weights is difficult due to varying architectures.

Proposed Solution - Knowledge Fusion for LLMs (\textsc{FuseLLM}):
- Leverages the generative distributions of multiple source LLMs to externalize their collective knowledge and unique strengths.
- Transfers capabilities of source LLMs into a single target LLM through lightweight continual training.  
- Emphasizes minimizing divergence between target LLM's distributions and source LLMs' distributions.
- Performs token alignment across models and fuses distributions with minimum cross-entropy fusion.

Experiments:
- Validated on 3 popular LLMs - Llama-2, OpenLLaMA, MPT across reasoning, commonsense and code generation tasks.
- Target LLM outperforms all individual source LLMs after continual training on compact, high-quality corpus.
- Analyzed impact of number of source LLMs, token alignment criteria, fusion strategies.
- Compared with ensemble, weight merging and knowledge distillation.

Main Contributions:  
- Explored a new direction of fusing capabilities of multiple structurally different LLMs into one model. 
- Proposed a method to effectively combine knowledge from diverse LLMs through distribution-level fusion.
- Showcased performance improvements over individual LLMs and strong baselines.
- Findings indicate distribution-level fusion can better utilize collective knowledge compared to conventional techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces and validates an approach for knowledge fusion of LLMs to create a unified model that surpasses capabilities of individual LLMs. Key novelty lies in fusing via generative distributions rather than output texts or model weights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called FuseLLM to fuse the knowledge and capabilities from multiple large language models (LLMs) with different architectures into a unified LLM, by leveraging the generative probability distributions from the source LLMs and continually training the target LLM to minimize the divergence between their distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper explores the novel concept of "knowledge fusion" for large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to combine the capabilities and strengths of multiple existing LLMs with diverse architectures into a single unified LLM in a cost-effective manner. 

Specifically, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a method called \textsc{FuseLLM} that leverages the generative probability distributions of source LLMs to externalize their collective knowledge and unique capabilities. This knowledge is then transferred to a target LLM through lightweight continual training.

2) Experiments are conducted by fusing 3 popular open-source LLMs - Llama-2, OpenLLaMA, and MPT. Results across reasoning, commonsense, and code generation tasks demonstrate that the fused LLM outperforms individual source LLMs.

3) Comparisons to traditional ensemble and weight merging techniques for model fusion highlight the superiority of the proposed knowledge fusion approach, especially given the architectural heterogeneity and scale of modern LLMs.

In summary, the key innovation is a novel knowledge fusion perspective for combining multiple LLMs in a probabilistic manner, which shows promising performance improvements over individual models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "knowledge fusion" for large language models (LLMs). What are some key motivations and potential benefits of fusing multiple LLMs compared to other approaches like simply training a single LLM from scratch?

2. The proposed FuseLLM method leverages the probabilistic distributions of multiple source LLMs. What is the intuition behind using these distributions to represent and fuse the knowledge embedded within the LLMs? 

3. FuseLLM employs a token alignment strategy to address mismatches in vocabularies across the LLMs. Can you explain the minimum edit distance (MinED) approach in detail? How does it compare to exact match in terms of balancing accuracy and retaining useful information?

4. The paper explores two fusion functions - minimum cross-entropy (MinCE) and average cross-entropy (AvgCE). Why does MinCE consistently outperform AvgCE in the experiments? What are the potential limitations of using a simple averaging approach?

5. How does the continual training process balance optimizing the standard causal language modeling (CLM) objective and the proposed fusion objective? What is the motivation behind using a static vs. dynamic weight to combine the two loss functions?

6. The experiments focus on a challenging scenario with very diverse LLMs. How do you think the relative strengths of the source LLMs affect the knowledge fusion results? Would you expect different outcomes if the sources were more similar?

7. The paper shows FuseLLM can outperform conventional knowledge distillation techniques. What enables it to more effectively leverage and combine multiple teacher models compared to distilling from a single teacher?  

8. What are some key differences between the proposed approach and traditional ensemble or weight merging methods for model fusion? What specifically allows FuseLLM to better harness collective knowledge?

9. One finding is that FuseLLM requires far fewer training tokens to match the performance of baseline continual training. What does this reveal about the information contained within the fused probability distributions?

10. What are some promising future directions for research on knowledge fusion of LLMs? What types of additional experiments could provide more insight into the method and its applications?
