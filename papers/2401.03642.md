# [A Content-Based Novelty Measure for Scholarly Publications: A Proof of   Concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for an automated measure of scientific novelty that aligns with human judgment to assist reviewers, editors, stakeholders in assessing the novelty of the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications.
- Existing novelty measures have limitations, such as relying on citations or semantics which provide coarse granularity, lacking interpretability, transparency and accessibility. 

Proposed Solution:
- Conceptualize novelty as "atypical combinations of knowledge" using an information-theoretic measure called "surprisal" that quantifies novelty based on divergence from expected word distributions.
- Train a language model (GPT-2) on Wikipedia to represent typical scientific discourse distribution (Q). Use Q to compute surprisal of word sequences in papers.
- Higher surprisal indicates higher novelty as it shows greater divergence from common scientific language patterns modeled by Q.

Key Contributions:  
- Information-theoretic, content-based novelty measure with high granularity at the word-level.
- Interpretable surprisal scores that are grounded in probability theory.
- Demonstrated face validity at token and sentence levels using illustrative quantum physics examples.
- Showed construct validity via significant surprisal differences on expert-labeled novel/normal paper groups.
- Openly accessible measure, code and data that is reproducible.

The measure holds promise for editors, stakeholders, policy makers to assess novelty-creativity and scientific dynamics relationships. Next steps are more rigorous validity testing and exploring generalization vs specificity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novelty measure for scholarly publications based on the information-theoretic concept of surprisal, calculated using a language model trained on Wikipedia to approximate scientific discourse.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new measure for assessing the novelty of scholarly publications based on their content. Specifically:

1) The paper conceptualizes novelty as "atypical combinations of knowledge" and adopts an information-theoretic measure called "surprisal" to quantify the novelty of text. The surprisal of a word or phrase indicates how unexpected it is based on a language model approximating typical scientific discourse.

2) The authors train a GPT-2 language model on Wikipedia to represent scientific language. The surprisal scores of words/phrases in a paper based on this model indicate their novelty.

3) The paper provides face validity evidence by showing the measure gives higher surprisal scores to scientifically more novel sentences. It also shows construct validity using a dataset of computer science papers labeled as novel/not novel by experts. 

4) The proposed novelty measure is interpretable, fine-grained at the word/phrase level, and openly accessible. The authors argue it addresses limitations in existing novelty measures and can benefit reviewers, editors, stakeholders in assessing novelty.

In summary, the key contribution is an information-theoretic, content-based novelty measure for scholarly publications validated on real datasets and made openly available.

The paper introduces a content-based novelty measure for scholarly publications using the information-theoretic concept of surprisal. It trains a GPT-2 language model on Wikipedia to approximate the distribution of scientific discourse. The novelty measure is assessed for face validity on illustrative quantum physics examples and construct validity on a dataset of authorship verification working notes. Overall, it demonstrates the potential for using surprisal derived from language models as an interpretable and granular novelty measure for academic papers and other scientific texts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using surprisal, an information-theoretic measure, to quantify the novelty of scholarly publications. Could you elaborate on why surprisal is an appropriate measure for this task compared to other statistical measures of divergence or novelty? What are the advantages and limitations?

2. The paper models the distribution of scientific discourse using a GPT-2 language model trained on Wikipedia. Could you discuss the rationale behind this modeling choice? Why Wikipedia over other scientific corpora? What are the tradeoffs with regard to generalization versus specificity? 

3. The paper argues that discriminative models like regression are theoretically unsuitable for evaluating novelty since they assume the test distribution matches the training distribution. However, some prior work has used such models. Could you critique the merits and demerits of using discriminative versus generative models for assessing novelty?

4. The paper examines novelty at the level of tokens/words. Could you discuss the implications of this choice versus assessing novelty at more coarse-grained semantic levels like keyphrases? What is the tradeoff between computational efficiency and semantic meaning?

5. The paper limits the conditioning context for probability estimation to 1,024 tokens based on the GPT-2 architecture. How does this context length affect reliability of surprisal estimates for long documents? Could the method be extended to account for longer contexts?

6. The face validity tests use synthetic examples generated via paraphrasing. What are the limitations of assessing validity this way? How could more rigorous tests be conducted?

7. The known groups validity test relies on expert annotations according to a binary novelty judgment. What are some weaknesses of such a evaluation approach? How could a more nuanced construct validation be undertaken? 

8. The paper focuses exclusively on English text. Could you discuss challenges and strategies for extending this approach to other languages both methodologically and philosophically?

9. The paper does not explicitly account for disciplinary differences. How might novelty expectations and scientific discourse vary across domains? Should domain-specific language models be used?

10. The paper suggests several directions for future work including peer evaluations and multilingual datasets. What other investigations could further assess the reliability and validity of the proposed method? What refinements are needed to make it broadly applicable?
