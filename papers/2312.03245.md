# [A Simple Framework to Enhance the Adversarial Robustness of Deep   Learning-based Intrusion Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03245)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture called DLL-IDS to defend against adversarial attacks. The system has three main components: a DL-based IDS, an adversarial example (AE) detector using local intrinsic dimensionality (LID), and an ML-based IDS. It evaluates network traffic from both adversarial and malicious perspectives. The DL-based IDS makes initial predictions, while the LID method leverages spatial differences between clean samples and AEs to train an SVM classifier for AE detection. If no AE is detected, the DL prediction is used. Otherwise, the traffic is passed to the ML-IDS (label spreading algorithm), which shows robustness to AEs. Experiments using NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 datasets demonstrate that DLL-IDS significantly improves IDS accuracy under various AE attacks compared to solely using DL, with over 70% accuracy even for strong CW attacks versus 18% for DL alone. The framework enhances IDS robustness by combining DL efficiency and ML robustness. Key innovations include introducing LID for AE detection in IDS and using ML to evaluate AE maliciousness based on an observation of ML's higher robustness to transferred AEs.
