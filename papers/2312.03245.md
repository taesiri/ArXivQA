# [A Simple Framework to Enhance the Adversarial Robustness of Deep   Learning-based Intrusion Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03245)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture called DLL-IDS to defend against adversarial attacks. The system has three main components: a DL-based IDS, an adversarial example (AE) detector using local intrinsic dimensionality (LID), and an ML-based IDS. It evaluates network traffic from both adversarial and malicious perspectives. The DL-based IDS makes initial predictions, while the LID method leverages spatial differences between clean samples and AEs to train an SVM classifier for AE detection. If no AE is detected, the DL prediction is used. Otherwise, the traffic is passed to the ML-IDS (label spreading algorithm), which shows robustness to AEs. Experiments using NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 datasets demonstrate that DLL-IDS significantly improves IDS accuracy under various AE attacks compared to solely using DL, with over 70% accuracy even for strong CW attacks versus 18% for DL alone. The framework enhances IDS robustness by combining DL efficiency and ML robustness. Key innovations include introducing LID for AE detection in IDS and using ML to evaluate AE maliciousness based on an observation of ML's higher robustness to transferred AEs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new intrusion detection system architecture called DLL-IDS that enhances robustness against adversarial attacks by combining a deep learning-based IDS, a local intrinsic dimensionality-based adversarial example detector, and a machine learning-based IDS in order to leverage the high efficiency of deep learning models and the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a new intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture called DLL-IDS to defend against adversarial attacks. This architecture evaluates network traffic from two perspectives: whether it is an adversarial example and whether the traffic itself is malicious. 

2. A novel adversarial example detector is introduced based on local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). This detector achieves high detection accuracy under various attacks, with the detection rate increasing as the intensity of attacks rises. 

3. The paper exploits the low attack transferability between deep learning models and traditional machine learning models. Specifically, the label spreading algorithm is identified to be robust against adversarial examples and is used to determine the maliciousness of traffic detected as adversarial examples. 

4. Experiments show the DLL-IDS framework significantly enhances the robustness of IDS against adversarial attacks. In the worst attack scenario tested using CW attack, the detection accuracy increased from 17.9% for the baseline IDS to 71.7% for DLL-IDS. The framework also maintains over 90% accuracy on clean examples.

In summary, the key innovation is proposing an IDS architecture that combines deep learning and machine learning models in a novel way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks, while still accurately determining the maliciousness of network traffic.
