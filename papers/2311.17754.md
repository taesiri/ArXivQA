# [Cinematic Behavior Transfer via NeRF-based Differentiable Filming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17754)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for transferring cinematic behaviors like camera movements and character actions from an existing film shot to new 2D or 3D content. The key idea is to first extract the camera trajectory and characters' motions using SMPL body models from the input video. This is achieved by optimizing the camera poses differentiably using a dynamic NeRF model trained on the SMPL tracks. The optimized camera then further refines the extracted SMPL motions. Finally, the authors demonstrate a full 3D engine workflow to apply the extracted behaviors to new characters and scenes, enabling superior quality and control compared to simply compositing on 2D footage. Quantitative experiments validate their camera optimization, and a user study confirms that the 3D workflow produces results more faithful to the original cinematic style. The approach flexibly handles complex real-world shots with multiple character and camera motion types. Limitations remain in very dynamic scenes and non-character focussed shots. Overall, this paper presents an effective pipeline to analyze and reapply cinematic behaviors to assist creative workflows.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to transfer cinematic behaviors like character motions and camera movements from an existing film shot to new 2D or 3D content by estimating SMPL tracks and optimizing camera trajectories using neural rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a reverse filming behavior estimation technique that optimizes camera trajectories by leveraging NeRF as a differentiable renderer and refining SMPL tracks. This allows for accurately extracting character motions and camera trajectories from a film shot.

2) It introduces a cinematic transfer pipeline that can transfer various shot types to new 2D video or 3D virtual environments. This enables reproducing the camera movement and character actions from an existing shot in new visual content. 

3) It incorporates a 3D engine workflow into the cinematic transfer pipeline. Compared to 2D transfer, this provides more flexibility to adjust different aspects like lighting, character motion, camera motion, etc. It also achieves better rendering quality and user satisfaction.

In summary, the key contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for extracting and re-applying cinematic behaviors from an existing film shot to new 2D or 3D visual content. The use of NeRF-based optimization and 3D engine workflow enhances the quality and flexibility of the transfer.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Cinematic behavior transfer - The main focus of the paper is transferring cinematic behaviors like camera movements and character motions from an existing shot to new 2D/3D content.

- Reverse filming behavior estimation - The paper proposes estimating camera trajectories and character motions from a shot video by "inverting" a trained neural radiance field (NeRF).

- Differentiable rendering - NeRF is used as a differentiable renderer to provide image-level supervision for camera trajectory optimization.

- SMPL tracks - The character motions are approximated as a sequence of SMPL poses over time. These tracks are refined using the optimized camera trajectory.

- 3D engine workflow - The extracted behaviors are transferred to new content using a 3D engine, which enables enhanced rendering quality, control, and flexibility compared to 2D transfer.

- Shot types - The method is shown to work on various common shot types like arc shots, tracking shots, push-in shots, etc.

- Camera trajectory optimization - A continuous camera trajectory representation is optimized to ensure it lies on the SE(3) manifold.

So in summary, the key terms cover cinematic behavior transfer, NeRF-based trajectory estimation, SMPL track refinement, 3D engine workflow for flexibility, and handling diverse shot types.
