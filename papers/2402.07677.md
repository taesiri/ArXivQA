# [GBOT: Graph-Based 3D Object Tracking for Augmented Reality-Assisted   Assembly Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Augmented reality (AR) assembly guidance requires accurate, real-time 6D object pose estimation and tracking of multiple parts through different assembly states. This is challenging due to occlusions, complex motions, and changing contexts during assembly.

- Existing methods either rely solely on pose estimation which is slow, or tracking which requires manual initialization and struggles with dynamic scenes across assembly states. 

- There is a lack of suitable datasets covering multi-part assemblies with ground truth poses across states.

Method:
- The authors propose Graph-based Object Tracking (GBOT), integrating pose estimation and tracking. 

- GBOT uses YOLOv8-based pose estimation to detect and initialize tracking of parts. 

- A novel multi-state assembly graph is introduced to model kinematic constraints between parts in different assembly states. This allows robust tracking through assemblies by linking parts into combined objects.

- Assembly states are automatically detected by thresholds on relative poses between connected parts.

- A new synthetic dataset is introduced covering 5 multi-part assemblies in 4 conditions (normal, blur, occlusion, lighting) to quantitatively benchmark performance.

Contributions:
- Real-time capable graph-based tracking for AR assembly guidance by integrating pose estimation and multi-state assembly graphs.

- Method to automatically detect state transitions during assembly based on relative poses.

- New dataset for benchmarking 6D object pose and tracking through multi-part assembly states.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and speed compared to pose estimation and tracking baselines, especially benefiting from assembly graph constraints.

- Demonstration of using GBOT for AR visualization overlays in real-time assembly guidance.
