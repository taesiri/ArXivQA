# [Mesh-LOAM: Real-time Mesh-Based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) methods struggle to deal with complex scenes and are sensitive to noise. Popular map representations like point clouds, grid maps, and surfels lack connectivity between elements, needing complex post-processing for robot utilization. Triangular meshes offer concise and accurate environment depictions but real-time meshing in large-scale scenes remains challenging. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a real-time large-scale mesh-based LOAM approach called Mesh-LOAM. The key ideas are:

1) An incremental voxel meshing method that efficiently reconstructs triangular meshes by traversing each point cloud only once. A scalable space partition scheme is used to compress space and accelerate computation.

2) A point-to-mesh odometry method that estimates 6DOF poses between incoming points and reconstructed mesh maps. It uses both geometric and feature cues for establishing point-to-mesh correspondences. 

3) A parallel spatial hashing scheme to manage voxels and meshes, enabling real-time performance. A voxel deletion scheme retains only relevant information allowing long-term mapping.

Contributions:

1) A complete mesh-based LOAM system achieving high odometry accuracy and high-quality mesh reconstruction in real-time.

2) An incremental voxel meshing approach updating scans in one pass using a hybrid weighting scheme and scalable partitioning.  

3) A point-to-mesh odometry formulation using both location and feature cues for robust data association.

4) Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in pose accuracy and map completeness. The system runs at 54 fps on a standard GPU.

In summary, the paper presents a novel mesh-based LOAM system for accurate and efficient simultaneous localization and mapping in large-scale scenes. The real-time performance, robustness to noise, and map completeness make it suitable for practical robotic applications.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A real-time mesh-based LiDAR odometry and mapping method for large-scale scenes using a parallel spatial-hashing scheme.

2) An incremental voxel meshing approach that integrates each LiDAR scan with only one traversal, taking advantage of a scalable partition module.
