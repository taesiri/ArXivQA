# [Ar-Spider: Text-to-SQL in Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15012)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-SQL semantic parsing has made significant progress for English language, but there is a lack of Arabic text-to-SQL datasets. 
- Arabic language poses two main challenges for text-to-SQL:
    1) Schema linguistic challenge: mapping Arabic natural language words to English database schema entities.  
    2) SQL structural challenge: mapping Arabic words to SQL clauses and operators.

Proposed Solution:
- Created the first Arabic cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset called "Ar-Spider" by manually translating the English Spider dataset into Arabic and verifying the translations.
- Evaluated two state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models on Ar-Spider: LGESQL and S2SQL. Integrated cross-lingual encoders mBERT and XLM-R into the models to handle the linguistic challenge.
- Proposed a Context Similarity Relationship (CSR) approach to further improve mapping of Arabic words to English schema by computing cosine similarity between their embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- Ar-Spider: the first Arabic cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset consisting of 9691 questions and SQL queries over 166 databases.
- Empirical evaluation of LGESQL and S2SQL models on Ar-Spider, demonstrating decent single-language performance achieving up to 65.57% accuracy.  
- Proposed CSR approach that establishes relationships between Arabic and English words based on context similarity, resulting in significant performance improvement of up to 2.33% across all model configurations.

The summary covers the key details on the problem being addressed, the proposed Ar-Spider dataset and CSR solution, empirical results, and main contributions made in the paper.
