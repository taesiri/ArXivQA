# [Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput   tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Attention models excel at recall (grounding text in context) but are inefficient for generation due to high memory usage. 
- Recent sub-quadratic architectures match perplexity but may lag in recall quality.
- There is a tradeoff between recall and throughput that has not been fully explored.

Proposed Solution - Based Architecture:  
- Combines linear attention (for long-range dependencies) and tiny sliding window attention (for precision).
- Varies hyperparameters like feature dimension and window size to navigate recall-throughput tradeoff curve.
- New algorithms and optimizations for efficient implementation on GPUs.

Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates fundamental tradeoff between recurrent state size and recall on synthetic and real tasks.
- Proves lower bounds relating state size to recall capability. 
- Proposes Based architecture that matches perplexity of Transformers and outperforms prior works in recall-intensive tasks.
- Achieves up to 24x higher throughput than prior optimized implementations of attention.
- Provides careful ablation studies and open-sourced implementation.

In summary, this paper performs an extensive analysis of the recall-efficiency tradeoff space and proposes the Based architecture that combines ideas from linear and sliding window attention to achieve better quality and throughput than prior sub-quadratic models. The strong empirical results, theoretical analysis, and optimized implementations advance the state-of-the-art in efficient sequence modeling.
