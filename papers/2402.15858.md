# [FedMM: Federated Multi-Modal Learning with Modality Heterogeneity in   Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Multimodal fusion of data from different sources (e.g. medical images, genomic data) can improve accuracy in computational pathology tasks like cancer diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning methods require access to raw patient data, posing privacy risks. Federated Learning (FL) allows privacy-preserving collaborative model training, but struggles with heterogeneous (partially overlapping) data distributions across hospitals.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Federated Multi-Modal learning (FedMM) to address multimodal heterogeneity in a privacy-preserving manner. Instead of training a joint multimodal model like in traditional FL, FedMM trains multiple single-modal feature extractors in a federated way. Hospitals can then leverage these pre-trained extractors locally to extract features from their data and perform downstream tasks. 

Key ideas:
- Introduce global class prototypes for each modality as "pseudo-labels" for federated training
- Dynamic loss balancing true label and prototype distance losses 
- Modular design extracts single modalities separately

Main Contributions:
- Propose FedMM framework to enable federated learning with heterogeneous multimodal medical data
- Innovative dynamic loss function to overcome lack of labels for federated training 
- Comprehensive experiments on two medical datasets demonstrate accuracy improvements over baselines

In summary, the paper makes a novelFedMM system to unlock the benefits of multimodal learning in practical clinical scenarios with distributed heterogeneous data sources. The proposed techniques outperform alternatives while preserving data privacy.
