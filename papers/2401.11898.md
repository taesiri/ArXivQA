# [Automated Completion of Statements and Proofs in Synthetic Geometry: an   Approach based on Constraint Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11898)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In mathematics, the activities of conjecturing (proposing statements to be true) and proving (showing the truth of statements) are interleaved and difficult to separate. However, most automated reasoning systems require complete and precise conjecture statements as input in order to attempt to prove them. This paper proposes a framework to simultaneously (1) complete incomplete conjectures by adding missing assumptions or further specifying the conclusion, (2) complete sketch proofs into fully detailed and verified proofs, with the goal of supporting more flexible reasoning as done by human mathematicians. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors focus on an area of geometry called coherent logic and utilize an automated reasoning system called Larus that they previously developed. The key idea is to represent conjectures and proofs as constraints on sequences of numbers that encode all required proof steps and formulas. Incomplete parts show up as missing constraints. The framework allows adding flexibility by selectively omitting constraints. A constraint solver searches for solutions that complete the missing parts. This provides found assumptions, specifications, and proof steps to turn an incomplete sketch into a complete machine-verifiable proof.

Main Contributions:
- A uniform approach to complete 3 aspects of partial reasoning: assumptions, goals, and proof steps
- Demonstrated for synthetic geometry proofs in a coherent logic fragment 
- Simple extension of the Larus automated reasoning system (less than 100 lines of code)
- Flexible technique allows different degrees of specification
- Can produce human-readable proofs that are also machine-checkable
- Provides examples of open-ended geometry conjecturing/proving as done by humans

The summary covers the key problem motivating the work, the core technique to address it based on constraint solving, and the main contributions showing the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach on representative geometry examples. It highlights the simplicity and flexibility of the technique as well as its ability to produce proofs accessible to both humans and machines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for completing incomplete conjectures and proofs in synthetic geometry using coherent logic and constraint solving, which can turn an under-specified conjecture into a proper theorem and help complete a proof sketch into a human-readable, machine-checkable proof.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a framework for completing incomplete conjectures and incomplete proofs in synthetic geometry. Specifically, the paper proposes an approach that can:

(a) Complete missing assumptions in a conjecture (called "abducts"). This allows proving conjectures with implicit or unknown assumptions.

(b) Complete under-specified goals in a conjecture. This allows discovering the actual theorem that can be proved from a set of assumptions, when the goal is not fully specified. 

(c) Complete partial proof sketches into complete, human-readable and machine-checkable proofs. This allows reconstructing fully detailed proofs from high-level proof outlines.

The key aspects of the approach are:

- It is based on coherent logic and constraint solving, making it suitable for producing intelligible, synthetic geometry proofs. 

- It is flexible to support different kinds of completion tasks in a uniform way, by adding/deleting constraints.

- It is implemented as an extension of the Larus theorem prover, and can generate proofs that are both human-readable and machine-verifiable.

- It is illustrated through several examples of completing statements and proofs related to Varignon's theorem in geometry.

So in summary, the main contribution is a flexible framework for completing conjectures and proofs in synthetic geometry, which unifies abductive reasoning, deductive reasoning and using hints to guide proof search.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Synthetic geometry - The paper focuses on developing an approach for automated reasoning in the context of synthetic (as opposed to algebraic) geometry.

- Coherent logic - The logical framework used in the paper is a fragment of first-order logic called coherent logic that is suitable for producing human-readable and machine-verifiable proofs.

- Automated theorem proving - The paper describes an approach to extend and apply automated theorem provers to complete partial conjectures and proof sketches. 

- Constraint solving - The underlying automated reasoning approach is based on a "theorem proving as constraint solving" paradigm that encodes proofs as constraint satisfaction problems.

- Abductive reasoning - The paper addresses using abductive reasoning to complete missing assumptions in partial conjectures.

- Inverse problems - Some of the sample geometry problems are phrased as "inverse problems" where the goal or assumptions are left unspecified.

- Proof assistants - The end goal is to produce formal proofs that are machine-checkable by interactive proof assistants.

- Proof sketches - The paper examines techniques for automatically completing informal proof outlines into detailed formal proofs.

- Geometry education - The motivating context and examples are connected to synthetic geometry problems and exercises in mathematics education.

So in summary, the key themes are around using automated reasoning and constraint-based techniques to complete partial and informal artifacts from synthetic geometry into detailed formal proofs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the approach for completing conjectures in this paper compare to existing approaches for conjecture generation like algebraic methods? What are the advantages and limitations?

2. The paper restricts abduct generation to conjunctions of ground atomic formulae. What extensions would be needed to handle more complex abducts like negations or disjunctions? 

3. What changes would need to be made to the constraint encoding to handle other logics like higher-order logic or modal logics?

4. Could this method be extended to find the minimal necessary assumptions/deducts or get all possible ones rather than just one? If so, how?

5. The paper uses coherent logic axioms for geometry. How difficult would it be to adapt the approach for axiom systems in drastically different theories like set theory or number theory?

6. How does the flexibility of proof guidance hints compare to proof advice methods from other ATP systems? What further extensions could improve the hints?

7. What metrics could be used to evaluate the completeness and quality of the generated abducts/deducts/proof extensions? 

8. How might the performance and capabilities scale if much longer proofs need to be constructed? What are the limitations?

9. The paper focuses on human-readable proofs. Would that conflict with handling more complex proofs that require lots of tedious low-level details? 

10. How difficult would it be to integrate this approach of theorem proving as constraint solving with other methods like semantic guidance or machine learning? What benefits or challenges might that integration bring?
