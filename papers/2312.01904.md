# [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection using Aggregated Normative Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01904)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) method called Aggregated Normative Diffusion (ANDi) for detecting lesions and tumors in multi-modal MRI scans of the brain. ANDi is based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and works by aggregating deviations between the actual and learned transitions during the denoising process. Key innovations include using pyramidal Gaussian noise during DDPM training to capture anomalies across scales and a geometric mean aggregation technique to dampen outlier effects. ANDi requires no separate inpainting stage for anomaly map refinement. The authors demonstrate that ANDi outperforms recent diffusion-based methods like AnoDDPM and AutoDDPM as well as a denoising autoencoder baseline on three diverse MRI datasets - BraTS'21, MSSEG, and Ljubljana. Improvements are particularly notable for multiple sclerosis lesion detection, with ANDi exceeding the next best method by up to 178% in terms of AUPRC. The authors also introduce a domain-agnostic evaluation strategy based on automatic Yen thresholding that allows unsupervised segmentation without dataset-specific tuning. Overall, ANDi pushes state-of-the-art for UAD in multi-modal MRI data.
