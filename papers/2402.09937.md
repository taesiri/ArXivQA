# [A Systematic Evaluation of Evolving Highly Nonlinear Boolean Functions   in Odd Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Boolean functions are important for applications like cryptography, coding theory, etc. Different applications have different requirements for properties of Boolean functions.  
- Constructing Boolean functions with desired properties is an active area of research. Two main approaches are algebraic constructions and heuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
- This paper focuses on the problem of evolving highly nonlinear Boolean functions in odd sizes, which is relevant but difficult and scarcely studied with EAs.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate three solution encodings (bitstring, floating-point, symbolic) and different EAs (genetic algorithms, genetic programming, etc) for evolving Boolean functions in sizes 7, 9, 11 and 13 variables.
- Start with basic EAs and then add local search operators to improve performance.
- Also evaluate subset of rotation symmetric Boolean functions which reduces search space.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic evaluation of different encodings and EAs for this problem over a range of sizes.
- Genetic programming (GP) consistently found best solutions across all sizes compared to other methods.
- Basic EAs did not reach best known solutions in larger sizes, falling short of custom heuristics. 
- Added local search substantially improved results for some encodings/EAs.
- One combination found 9-variable Boolean function with nonlinearity 241, first time this was achieved with an EA.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that constructing highly nonlinear odd-sized Boolean functions with EAs is challenging but can be improved by using GP and adding local search. The experiments and analyses provide insights into most suitable representations and algorithms.
