# [A Systematic Evaluation of Evolving Highly Nonlinear Boolean Functions   in Odd Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Boolean functions are important for applications like cryptography, coding theory, etc. Different applications have different requirements for properties of Boolean functions.  
- Constructing Boolean functions with desired properties is an active area of research. Two main approaches are algebraic constructions and heuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
- This paper focuses on the problem of evolving highly nonlinear Boolean functions in odd sizes, which is relevant but difficult and scarcely studied with EAs.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate three solution encodings (bitstring, floating-point, symbolic) and different EAs (genetic algorithms, genetic programming, etc) for evolving Boolean functions in sizes 7, 9, 11 and 13 variables.
- Start with basic EAs and then add local search operators to improve performance.
- Also evaluate subset of rotation symmetric Boolean functions which reduces search space.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic evaluation of different encodings and EAs for this problem over a range of sizes.
- Genetic programming (GP) consistently found best solutions across all sizes compared to other methods.
- Basic EAs did not reach best known solutions in larger sizes, falling short of custom heuristics. 
- Added local search substantially improved results for some encodings/EAs.
- One combination found 9-variable Boolean function with nonlinearity 241, first time this was achieved with an EA.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that constructing highly nonlinear odd-sized Boolean functions with EAs is challenging but can be improved by using GP and adding local search. The experiments and analyses provide insights into most suitable representations and algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically evaluates evolutionary algorithms with three solution encodings (bitstring, floating-point, and symbolic) for evolving highly nonlinear Boolean functions in odd sizes, showing genetic programming to perform best but still falling short of the best known results, with the addition of local search leading to improved results and finding a 9-variable Boolean function with nonlinearity 241.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic evaluation of different evolutionary computation methods and representations for evolving highly nonlinear Boolean functions in odd sizes. Specifically:

- The paper evaluates three different solution encodings: bitstring, symbolic/tree-based genetic programming, and floating point. These are tested on four different odd sizes of Boolean functions: 7, 9, 11, and 13 variables. 

- Six different continuous optimization algorithms are tested with the floating point encoding, including ABC, CLONALG, CMA-ES, DE, OPTIA, and a genetic algorithm (GA-SST).

- The results show genetic programming (GP) consistently achieves the best performance across all sizes, obtaining significantly better results than most other methods. However, the GP results still fall short of the best known nonlinearities.

- Local search enhancements are added to the GP and bitstring methods. This allows the bitstring method to achieve a nonlinearity of 241 for 9 variables when combined with rotation symmetry and local search, which is the first time an evolutionary algorithm has achieved this result.

So in summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive benchmarking of representations and algorithms for this problem, as well as achieving a new best evolutionary algorithm result by enhancing the bitstring encoding with problem-specific knowledge. The paper also provides several interesting directions for future work.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper explores evolving highly nonlinear Boolean functions in odd sizes. Why is this an interesting and challenging problem mathematically and from the perspective of evolutionary algorithms? What makes this problem difficult?

2) The paper evaluates three solution encodings: bitstring, floating-point, and symbolic encoding. Can you explain the key differences between these encodings and how they represent Boolean functions? What are the trade-offs with each encoding?

3) Genetic programming (GP) with the symbolic encoding achieved the best overall results. Why do you think GP was most effective for this problem? What specific advantages does the symbolic encoding paired with GP provide?

4) The paper adds local search variants to try to further improve the algorithms. Can you explain the two local search approaches that were tested? Why was local search not very effective for improving the GP results but did help the bitstring encoding?

5) One combination of bitstring encoding, local search, and restricting the search to rotation symmetric Boolean functions achieved a nonlinearity of 241 for 9 variables. Why is this an important result? How does it compare to previous evolutionary algorithm results on this problem?

6) The paper compares the evolutionary algorithm results to custom heuristics from past literature that hold the best known results. Why have custom heuristics been more effective than general evolutionary algorithms at this problem so far? What aspects of the custom methods are advantageous?  

7) For what Boolean function sizes (number of variables) are the paper's evolutionary algorithm results optimal, sub-optimal or unknown in relation to the best known nonlinearity values? Can you summarize the key results per function size?

8) How does the search space size compare between general Boolean functions versus rotation symmetric Boolean functions? Why did the paper elect to restrict to rotation symmetric functions for the bitstring and floating-point encodings?

9) The paper identifies two categories of past work on evolving Boolean functions: (1) works relevant mathematically and for evolutionary algorithms versus (2) works relevant just for evolutionary algorithms. Can you explain the key differences between these two categories the paper identifies? Why is this an important distinction when surveying the literature?

10) Based on the paper's results, what avenues are identified for future work? What further encodings, local search methods, or problem formulations does the paper propose investigating? What other experiments would you suggest to build on this research?
