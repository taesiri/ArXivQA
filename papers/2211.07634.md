# [Follow the Wisdom of the Crowd: Effective Text Generation via Minimum   Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07634)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a simple and general decoding method that improves both the diversity and quality of text generated by large language models across a wide range of natural language generation tasks?

The key hypothesis seems to be that applying principles of minimum Bayes risk decoding, inspired by the "wisdom of the crowd", can yield such improvements in diversity and quality. Specifically, the authors propose that selecting the output candidate that is most aligned with or representative of the whole set of diverse candidates (the "crowd") will produce better results than simply sampling one output randomly. They test this hypothesis across summarization, data-to-text generation, translation, style transfer and other tasks.

In summary, the main research question is how to improve conditional text generation from large LMs, with the central hypothesis being that minimum Bayes risk decoding based on crowd alignments can achieve better diversity and quality. The paper aims to validate this hypothesis empirically across diverse NLG tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new decoding method called "Crowd Sampling" for text generation based on minimum Bayes risk principles. The key ideas are:

- Inspired by the "wisdom of the crowd" principle, Crowd Sampling generates multiple candidate texts using stochastic sampling, compares the candidates using a utility function like BLEURT or BERTScore, and selects the candidate with the highest expected reward (i.e. lowest risk). 

- Crowd Sampling generalizes majority voting by using "soft" semantic similarity metrics rather than strict matching. It also generalizes the Prompt-and-Rerank method by comparing candidates to the full set rather than independently.

- Experiments across many text generation tasks (summarization, data-to-text, translation, style transfer, etc.) show Crowd Sampling improves performance by 3-7 ROUGE/BLEU points over standard decoding methods like greedy, beam search, or temperature sampling.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple but effective family of decoding methods based on minimum Bayes risk principles that improves conditional text generation across a diverse set of tasks. The results support the benefits of "crowd wisdom" in text generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents a new decoding method called Crowd Sampling for improving text generation from language models. Crowd Sampling generates multiple candidate texts using sampling, compares the candidates using semantic similarity metrics like BLEURT, and selects the candidate with the highest overall similarity to the others. Experiments show it improves metrics like ROUGE and BLEU across many text generation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new decoding method called Crowd Sampling that improves text generation from language models by generating multiple candidates and picking the most "crowd-wise" one.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text generation and decoding methods:

- The key idea of using minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD) for text generation is novel compared to most prior work, which has focused on greedy decoding, beam search, or sampling methods like temperature and top-k/p sampling. MBRD has been used before in other NLP tasks like parsing and machine translation, but not widely for text generation with large language models.

- The idea of framing MBRD as a "wisdom of the crowd" approach seems new. Connecting MBRD to the principle of collective intelligence and diversity yielding better decisions is an insightful framing.

- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MBRD across a remarkably broad set of text generation tasks - summarization, data-to-text, translation, style transfer, etc. Showing the versatility of this method across tasks is a valuable contribution.

- Most prior work has focused on improving specific text generation tasks independently. This paper takes a model-agnostic approach applicable to any text generator, which is more general.

- The paper sets new SOTA results on WebNLG and WMT16, outperforming results from other recent models like BART and T5. This helps benchmark the effectiveness of the method.

- The size of improvements from using MBRD (3-7 ROUGE/BLEU points) is quite significant compared to differences between models seen in other work. The gains are more substantial than just changing model architecture or hyperparameters.

- Ablation studies on factors like candidate pool size and choice of utility function provide useful analysis and guidance for applying MBRD effectively in practice.

Overall, I would say this paper introduces a novel decoding method for text generation that is demonstrated to be widely effective across tasks and achieve strong results compared to prior work. The model-agnostic approach is general, and the ablation studies provide practical insights into implementing the method.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring more efficient methods for computing or estimating the textual similarity matrix of candidates. The current approach requires O(k^2) comparisons which can be computationally expensive, especially when using learned metrics like BLEURT. The authors suggest investigating approximations or other techniques to reduce this complexity.

- Evaluating the efficacy of MBRD under smaller language models like GPT-2 and GPT-J. The current experiments focus on very large models like Codex but it would be useful to test with smaller models as well.

- Trying different values of the temperature parameter tau for candidate generation, as the choice impacts diversity. The authors found tau=0.7 worked well across tasks but other values may be better suited for specific datasets.

- Extending the work beyond English language tasks/metrics. The current experiments focus on English but the framework could support any language. Exploring multilingual datasets and metrics is suggested.

- Comparing additional utility/alignment metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BARTScore, etc. The current work focuses on BLEURT and BERTScore but other metrics may also be effective.

- Testing MBRD in longer text generation setups. The gains were very large on a patent summarization dataset suggesting even bigger benefits may be possible for long-form generation.

- Modifying the MBRD approach itself, for example changing how candidates are generated or incorporating model confidence scores. The basic framework has room for optimization.

- Combining MBRD with prompt tuning or other test-time methods to further improve results. MBRD could complement other decoding strategies.

In summary, the main directions are improving computational efficiency, broadening the models and languages tested, trying additional alignment metrics, evaluating on long-form text, and modifying or extending the core MBRD approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new family of decoding methods called Crowd Sampling for conditional text generation tasks based on principles of minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD) and the wisdom of the crowd. MBRD seeks to select the candidate text from a pool of candidates that has the lowest expected risk or highest expected reward. Crowd Sampling generates multiple candidate texts using sampling, compares each candidate to the others using a utility function like BLEURT or BERTScore that measures semantic similarity, and selects the candidate with the highest alignment to the overall pool. Experiments across many text generation tasks like summarization, translation, and style transfer show Crowd Sampling improves performance by 3-7 ROUGE and BLEU points over standard decoding methods like greedy search and beam search. Crowd Sampling achieves new SOTA results on WebNLG and WMT16 and also outperforms recent models like PaLM. The results highlight how the collective opinion of a diverse group in Crowd Sampling produces better outputs than individual text generation decoding methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new family of decoding methods called Crowd Sampling for conditional text generation based on the principle of "wisdom of the crowd." Crowd Sampling utilizes minimum Bayes risk decoding to select the output candidate that has the lowest expected risk (highest expected reward) according to a given utility function. 

The key idea is to first generate multiple candidate texts using stochastic sampling methods like temperature or nucleus sampling. Then, compare each candidate text to the others using an alignment function like BLEURT or BERTScore. Finally, select the candidate text that has the highest overall alignment score with the group. Experiments across many text generation tasks like summarization, translation, and style transfer show Crowd Sampling improves performance by 3-7 ROUGE/BLEU points over standard decoding methods. Overall, Crowd Sampling provides a simple but effective drop-in replacement for existing sampling strategies to improve the quality and diversity of text generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new decoding method for text generation called Crowd Sampling, which is based on minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD) principles. The key idea is to generate multiple candidate texts using a sampling method like temperature sampling, then compare each candidate to the others using a utility function like BLEURT or BERTScore to measure semantic alignment, and finally select the candidate with the highest expected reward (lowest risk). This allows it to pick the "wisest" text from a diverse set of options, improving on standard greedy and sampling methods. The authors show it delivers 3-7 ROUGE/BLEU score gains on summarization, data-to-text, translation, style transfer, and captioning tasks. Overall, crowd sampling provides a simple but effective method to improve text generation quality across many domains by applying the wisdom of the crowd principle.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents a new method called "Crowd Sampling" for decoding text generated by large language models. The key problem it is trying to address is the trade-off between diversity and quality in open-ended natural language generation tasks like summarization. 

Existing decoding methods like greedy/beam search or temperature sampling struggle to balance generating diverse, high-quality text. Greedy and beam search can produce repetitive, dull outputs while temperature sampling yields more diverse but lower quality text. 

The main question the paper seems to be addressing is: How can we get the best of both worlds - generate text that is both diverse and high quality?

The proposed "Crowd Sampling" method is based on the idea of minimum Bayes risk decoding. It generates multiple candidate texts using sampling, compares them to each other using a utility function like BLEURT or BERTScore, and selects the one with the highest expected reward (least risk). This is inspired by the "wisdom of crowds" idea - that the collective opinion of a diverse group is better than individual opinions.

So in summary, the key problem is balancing diversity and quality in decoding, and the main question is how to achieve both. The proposed Crowd Sampling method tries to address this by generating multiple candidates and picking the "best" one based on alignment with the group.
