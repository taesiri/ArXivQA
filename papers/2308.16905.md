# [InterDiff: Generating 3D Human-Object Interactions with Physics-Informed   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16905)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we generate realistic and long-term 3D predictions of human-object interactions, while ensuring physical validity of the interactions?The key challenges are:- Modeling full-body human motion and diverse object dynamics simultaneously, which is complex due to variability in objects. - Ensuring the predicted interactions are physically plausible, with natural contact between human and object surfaces without penetration.To address these challenges, the authors propose InterDiff, a framework with two key components:1) Interaction diffusion: A diffusion model to capture the distribution of future human-object interactions.2) Interaction correction: A physics-informed predictor that corrects the diffusion outputs by modeling simple relative motions of objects with respect to contact points on the human body. The main hypothesis is that by incorporating physics priors into the diffusion model through a separate interaction corrector, they can generate high-quality, long-term 3D HOI predictions that avoid common artifacts like penetration and unnatural contact. Experiments on HOI datasets seem to validate their method's effectiveness.In summary, the key research question is how to generate physically valid long-term HOI predictions, which is addressed through an interaction diffusion framework enhanced by an inductive bias for simple relative object motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel task of 3D human-object interaction (HOI) prediction, where the goal is to forecast future 3D mesh-based whole-body human motion and object dynamics simultaneously. This is more challenging than previous work on HOI synthesis which often focuses on hand-object interactions or represents interactions with skeletons. 2. Introducing InterDiff, a framework consisting of two key components - interaction diffusion and interaction correction. The interaction diffusion module leverages a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model to capture the distribution of future HOIs. The interaction correction module uses a physics-informed predictor to refine the diffusion outputs by modeling the relative object motion with respect to contact points on the human body.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of InterDiff on 3D HOI datasets, where it generates plausible long-term HOI predictions while avoiding common artifacts like penetration and floating contacts. The method also shows good generalization to unseen objects and cross-dataset evaluation.4. Highlighting the benefits of modeling relative object motion under an appropriate reference frame determined by contact points, which leads to simpler motion patterns that are easier for the predictor to handle. This allows plausible interactions to be generated without complex post-optimization or physics simulation.In summary, the key novelty lies in formulating the new task, and proposing InterDiff as an effective learning-based solution that integrates diffusion modeling with intuitive physics priors for high-quality 3D HOI forecasting. The experiments validate the approach and analyze the importance of the interaction correction module.
