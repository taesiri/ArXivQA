# [Fine-tuning can cripple your foundation model; preserving features may   be the solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13320)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new regularizer called LDIFS that minimizes the $\ell_2$ distance between features of the original foundation model and the model being fine-tuned. How does this differ from previous regularization methods like L2SP that focus on minimizing distance in parameter space? What are the relative advantages of using feature space distance?

2. The paper argues that minimizing distance in feature space better preserves the input-output behavior and encoded knowledge of the original foundation model. But could minimizing distance in feature space potentially limit the model's ability to learn completely new representations on the downstream task? How would you balance preserving prior knowledge versus learning new concepts?

3. When computing LDIFS, the paper extracts features from different layers of the network rather than just the last layer. What is the motivation behind using multi-layer features? Does using only the last layer's features lead to worse performance? 

4. How sensitive is the performance of LDIFS to the choice of layers used for extracting features? Did the authors experiment with different combinations or numbers of layers? Is there an optimal strategy for choosing which layers to use?

5. The LDIFS regularizer introduces a new hyperparameter Î»_{LDIFS} to control the relative weight of feature space distance. How does tuning this parameter impact model performance? Is LDIFS very sensitive to the exact value chosen?

6. For the continual learning experiments, how did the authors choose the order of tasks for fine-tuning? Could the ordering or curriculum impact how well LDIFS accumulates knowledge over multiple tasks?

7. The paper benchmarks several end-to-end fine-tuning methods in addition to LDIFS. What differences did the authors notice in how these methods balance downstream performance versus concept forgetting?

8. How does the choice of pre-trained foundation model impact the concept forgetting phenomena studied in this paper? Would a different model architecture lead to different conclusions?

9. The paper studies image classification tasks exclusively. Do you think concept forgetting would manifest differently in other domains like NLP? How could the LDIFS approach be adapted?

10. The authors propose that concept forgetting is an important problem for foundation models. But could some forgetting of irrelevant concepts also be beneficial? Is complete knowledge retention always the right goal?


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Investigating the phenomenon of "concept forgetting" in pre-trained foundation models when they are fine-tuned on downstream tasks. The authors show through experiments that most end-to-end fine-tuning methods cause the model to significantly lose its ability to recognize concepts outside of the downstream task it is fine-tuned on.

2. Analyzing different end-to-end fine-tuning methods and finding that the L2SP regularizer, which keeps the fine-tuned model close to the original in parameter space, consistently outperforms others in minimizing concept forgetting. 

3. Proposing a new regularizer called LDIFS (L2 distance in feature space) that minimizes the distance between the original and fine-tuned model in feature space rather than parameter space. This is shown to significantly reduce concept forgetting without impacting downstream task performance.

4. Providing evidence that fine-tuning methods that cause the model to diverge away from the original pre-trained model in parameter or feature space tend to suffer more from concept forgetting. 

5. Demonstrating that the proposed LDIFS regularizer enables more continual fine-tuning on a sequence of tasks without catastrophic forgetting.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be identifying and providing a solution to mitigate the problem of concept forgetting in fine-tuned foundation models, thereby enabling more effective transfer learning. The LDIFS regularizer is proposed as a simple but effective technique to achieve this.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are a few thoughts on how it compares to other research in the field:

- The paper focuses on investigating the phenomenon of "concept forgetting" that can occur when fine-tuning foundation models like CLIP on downstream tasks. This examination of how fine-tuning can negatively impact a model's previously learned knowledge is a relatively underexplored area compared to work that focuses only on maximizing downstream task performance.

- The paper systematically benchmarks several standard fine-tuning techniques (e.g. linear probing, end-to-end fine-tuning) across multiple datasets to quantify the extent of concept forgetting. This allows them to surface that concept forgetting is a general issue affecting most methods, rather than an isolated problem. 

- They analyze why certain techniques like L2SP regularization are more effective at minimizing concept forgetting. These insights motivate their proposed LDIFS method which directly regularizes in the feature space rather than parameter space. Most prior work has not explored feature space regularization for preserving knowledge.

- The paper also briefly looks at a continual fine-tuning setup with a sequence of tasks, taking a step towards the more realistic goal of accumulating knowledge over multiple fine-tuning experiences rather than just preserving it. Most similar work has focused solely on single-task fine-tuning.

- Overall, the paper makes useful empirical contributions in benchmarking concept forgetting, analyzing why it happens, and demonstrating a way to mitigate it. The analysis is grounded in previous literature, but manages to provide novel angles and insights specific to large foundation models.

In summary, I would say the paper advances the understanding of how fine-tuning impacts foundation models in an understudied direction, while building nicely on prior techniques and analyses. The proposed method is simple but effective, and likely to be a helpful baseline for future work on knowledge preservation and accumulation in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating concept forgetting/catastrophic forgetting in other types of foundation models besides contrastive vision-language models like CLIP, such as large language models. The phenomena may manifest differently in other model families.

- Fundamentally defining what constitutes a "concept" for foundation models and determining the right granularity to study concept forgetting. The paper mentions this is an important open question. 

- Studying continual fine-tuning of foundation models to encourage knowledge accumulation over a sequence of tasks, rather than forgetting. The authors present some initial experiments on this, but more work can be done.

- Analyzing the effect of task ordering during continual fine-tuning on forward and backward transfer. The paper shows ordering impacts transferability.

- Exploring other mechanisms like task-specific adapter modules along with techniques like LDIFS to minimize concept forgetting during fine-tuning.

- Evaluating the effect of concept forgetting on other properties like model robustness, OOD generalization etc. besides just performance on IID datasets.

- Developing better methods to quantify concept forgetting that go beyond just performance on existing datasets. The paper proposes approximate measures but more rigorous definitions may be possible.

- Exploring why LP-init-L2SP causes positive forward transfer from EuroSAT to DTD and analyzing such rare cases of "knowledge gain" during fine-tuning.

In summary, the authors recommend more investigation into continual fine-tuning, better defining and quantifying concepts in foundation models, studying concept forgetting in other model families, and analyzing the effect of concept forgetting on model properties beyond standard supervised learning.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How does end-to-end fine-tuning of foundation models affect their ability to recognize real-world concepts outside of the specific downstream task they are fine-tuned on?

The key points are:

- Foundation models like CLIP are pre-trained on massive datasets scraped from the internet to encode knowledge about a vast number of real-world concepts. 

- When fine-tuned on a downstream task, most end-to-end fine-tuning methods significantly reduce the model's ability to recognize concepts outside that task. The authors call this "concept forgetting".

- Concept forgetting is undesirable as it damages the broad knowledge the foundation model worked hard to accumulate during pre-training.

- The authors investigate concept forgetting across different fine-tuning methods and datasets. They find it is a consistent issue.

- They analyze why concept forgetting happens and propose a new regularizer called LDIFS to minimize it by keeping fine-tuned models close to the original in feature space.

- LDIFS is shown to significantly reduce concept forgetting without hurting downstream task performance.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that end-to-end fine-tuning causes concept forgetting in foundation models, which the authors demonstrate and address with their proposed LDIFS regularizer.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how end-to-end fine-tuning of large pre-trained foundation models like CLIP on downstream tasks can significantly damage the model's ability to recognize concepts outside of the fine-tuning task. This phenomenon, referred to as "concept forgetting", is undesirable as the foundation models have been pre-trained on massive amounts of data to encode knowledge about many real-world concepts. Through experiments, the authors find concept forgetting to be prevalent across different fine-tuning methods. Analyzing the L2SP regularizer provides insights into keeping fine-tuned models close to the original in feature space, leading to a proposed LDIFS regularizer that minimizes feature space distance during fine-tuning. Experiments show LDIFS can significantly reduce concept forgetting without compromising performance on the downstream task. Overall, the paper provides analysis and methods to preserve the breadth of knowledge in foundation models when fine-tuning for specialized tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how end-to-end fine-tuning of pre-trained foundation models like CLIP can lead to a phenomenon called "concept forgetting", where the fine-tuned model loses its ability to recognize concepts outside of the downstream task it was fine-tuned on. The authors first benchmark several popular fine-tuning methods like logistic regression and cross-entropy training on a variety of image classification datasets. They find that while fine-tuning improves performance on the downstream task, it significantly reduces the model's zero-shot and linear probe accuracy on other datasets, indicating concept forgetting. 

To mitigate concept forgetting, the authors propose a new regularizer called LDIFS that minimizes the L2 distance between features of the original and fine-tuned models. Experiments show LDIFS significantly reduces concept forgetting across datasets compared to other methods, without compromising downstream task performance. The authors suggest that keeping fine-tuned models close to the original foundation model in feature space is an effective way to preserve the model's wide knowledge while still adapting it to new domains. They conclude that LDIFS provides a simple but promising step towards continual fine-tuning and concept accumulation in large foundation models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new regularizer called LDIFS (L2 distance in feature space) for end-to-end fine-tuning of foundation models like CLIP. It argues that most end-to-end fine-tuning methods cause the fine-tuned model to "forget" concepts it was exposed to during pre-training, an effect the authors call concept forgetting. To mitigate this, LDIFS minimizes the L2 distance between the features of the original pre-trained model and the fine-tuned model on the training data. This helps preserve the original model's features and input-output behavior, reducing concept forgetting. Specifically, the LDIFS loss combines the standard cross-entropy loss with an L2 term that minimizes the distance between concatenated internal representations of the pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Experiments show LDIFS substantially reduces concept forgetting across various vision datasets without hurting downstream task performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes a new regularization method called LDIFS that minimizes the distance between pre-trained and fine-tuned feature representations, allowing foundation models to be fine-tuned on downstream tasks without forgetting previously learned concepts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is the phenomenon of "concept forgetting" that can occur when fine-tuning foundation models like CLIP on downstream tasks. 

The paper points out that foundation models like CLIP are pre-trained on massive datasets with millions or billions of examples, giving them knowledge about a vast number of real-world concepts. However, when these models are fine-tuned on a specific downstream task, their ability to recognize concepts outside of that task can become significantly reduced. 

The authors refer to this reduction in the model's general concept knowledge as "concept forgetting", and note that it is an undesirable effect since a lot of time and resources went into teaching the model those concepts originally during pre-training.

The main question the paper seems to be exploring is: How can we fine-tune foundation models like CLIP on downstream tasks without causing it to "forget" all the valuable concept knowledge it gained during pre-training?

The paper benchmarks different fine-tuning methods to show they suffer from concept forgetting. It then analyzes why some methods like L2SP lose less knowledge, and uses those insights to propose a new regularizer called LDIFS that minimizes concept forgetting during fine-tuning.

In summary, the key problem is the concept forgetting that occurs in foundation models during downstream fine-tuning, and the question is how to fine-tune them without losing their pre-trained concept knowledge. The paper explores this phenomenon and proposes a method to address it.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the phenomenon of "concept forgetting" in foundation models like CLIP when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. The authors find that while fine-tuning boosts performance on the downstream task, it can significantly damage the model's ability to recognize concepts outside that task which it originally learned during pre-training. They systematically evaluate 6 popular end-to-end fine-tuning methods on 9 image classification tasks and show all suffer from concept forgetting, just to varying degrees. Analyzing the L2SP regularizer reveals that keeping the fine-tuned model in the vicinity of the original foundation model in parameter or feature space reduces forgetting. Building on this, the authors propose a new regularizer called LDIFS which minimizes the L2 distance between features of the original and fine-tuned models. Experiments show LDIFS consistently minimizes concept forgetting across tasks without hurting downstream performance. The authors also take a first step towards continual fine-tuning, showing LDIFS better preserves performance on the first task when fine-tuned on a sequence of tasks. Overall, this work provides important analysis and insights into the undesirable side effects of fine-tuning foundation models.
