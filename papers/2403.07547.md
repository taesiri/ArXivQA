# [SMURF: Continuous Dynamics for Motion-Deblurring Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07547)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing 3D scenes and rendering novel views from images captured in the real world is an important problem in computer vision and graphics. However, images often contain motion blur due to camera shake during capture. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods fail to handle such blurry inputs effectively. Recent works have addressed this by estimating a blur kernel to model camera motion, but have limitations: (1) The kernels do not model the continuous camera motion, instead estimating jointly over the exposure time. (2) They trade off quality, training speed and rendering speed.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Sequential Motion Understanding Radiance Fields (SMURF) to address the above issues. The key ideas are:

1) A Continuous Motion Blur Kernel (CMBK) that uses a neural ODE to model the continuous camera motion over time. This allows precisely tracking even complex/irregular motions.

2) Two regularizations - residual momentum and output suppression loss - to prevent CMBK outputs from diverging. 

3) Adopting Tensorial Radiance Fields (TensoRF) as the backbone for fast, high-quality 3D reconstruction from blurry images. Incomplete blur info and complete sharp info merge coherently into voxels via CMBK.

Main Contributions:

- First continuous modeling of camera motion blur kernel using neural ODEs
- Two regularizations for stable kernel estimation 
- State-of-the-art quality and speed by combining CMBK with TensoRF
- Extensive experiments showing SMURF outperforms previous approaches on benchmark datasets for quality, training time and rendering time

In summary, SMURF sets a new state-of-the-art for reconstructing 3D scenes from blurry images, with continuous modeling of motion blur and fast performance. The CMBK and regularizations enable high-quality results, while TensoRF provides an efficient backbone.
