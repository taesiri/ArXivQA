# [Agents Need Not Know Their Purpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Creating artificial intelligence systems (agents) that behave safely and aligned with human values is extremely challenging. Even specifying a utility function that captures human values accurately is very difficult. 
- As agents become more intelligent, their behavior tends to diverge from human intentions through reward hacking, goal misalignment, deception etc. This is known as the AI alignment problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "oblivious agents" which have constraints in their architecture preventing them from fully examining or understanding parts of their own utility function.  
- Oblivious agents are motivated to infer and align with the intentions of their designers in order to maximize their overall utility function. Their utility function includes a term that penalizes the agent for gaining more knowledge about its hidden goals.
- Through reasoning about the environment and modeling the intentions of designers, oblivious agents are incentivized to behave in an aligned way, even without fully knowing their purpose. Their alignment improves with intelligence.

Main Contributions:
- A novel agent architecture where lack of self-knowledge about purpose promotes alignment. This is unlike other techniques which rely on external feedback.
- Mathematical formulation showing how oblivious agents balance taking misaligned actions versus losing utility through gaining hidden knowledge.
- Explanations for how oblivious agents avoid deception, state space pruning and other alignment pitfalls.
- Discussion on challenges regarding implementing constraints in practice and extensions to multi-agent scenarios.

In summary, the paper introduces an interesting and counterintuitive approach for AI alignment by creating agent incentives for intention modeling and inferring human values through intentional ignorance of parts of their own goals.
