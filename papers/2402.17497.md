# [REAR: A Relevance-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Open-Domain   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17497)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes REAR, a relevance-aware retrieval-augmented framework for open-domain question answering that enhances large language models' ability to assess the relevance of retrieved documents and selectively utilize them to improve answer accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. Proposing REAR, a relevance-aware retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering. REAR incorporates a specially designed rank head to precisely assess the relevance between queries and documents.

2. An improved training method with bi-granularity relevance fusion to leverage both coarse-grained and fine-grained relevance supervision. This helps enhance fine-grained relevance assessment capabilities. 

3. Noise-resistant training to make the model more robust against irrelevant or noisy content in the retrieved documents. This helps the model selectively utilize external knowledge.

4. Extensive experiments on four open-domain QA datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of REAR in relevance assessment and knowledge utilization compared to previous methods.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing the self-awareness of source relevance in retrieval-augmented generation systems through architectural and algorithmic improvements for more selective and reliable utilization of external knowledge.
