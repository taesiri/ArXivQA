# [Who Plays First? Optimizing the Order of Play in Stackelberg Games with   Many Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of determining the optimal order of play (i.e., who plays first, who plays next, etc.) among multiple self-interested agents interacting in a shared environment, with the goal of maximizing the overall social welfare. This problem arises in many real-world applications such as air traffic control, delivery vehicle coordination, etc. However, finding the optimal order of play is challenging as the number of possible permutations scales factorially with the number of agents, making exhaustive search intractable. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Branch and Play (BNP) to efficiently solve this problem. BNP formulates determining the optimal order of play as a mixed-integer optimization problem and uses a branch-and-bound method to implicitly enumerate the exponentially-large search space of possible orderings. To evaluate each candidate ordering, BNP employs Sequential Trajectory Planning (STP), an extended version of a popular multi-agent planning algorithm. The paper proves that STP produces local Stackelberg equilibria for a given order of play. By combining BNP and STP, the paper provides an efficient approach to compute socially optimal Stackelberg equilibria without having to exhaustively enumerate all possible orderings.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the optimal order of play problem as a mixed-integer optimization over Stackelberg games 
- Proposal of BNP, a branch-and-bound algorithm that leverages novel bounding & pruning techniques to efficiently search the space of orderings
- Extension of STP algorithm and proof that it computes local Stackelberg equilibria for any given order of play  
- Demonstration of BNP outperforming several baselines in air traffic control, swarm coordination, and hardware experiments

In summary, the paper provides a principled approach based on game theory and optimization to address the very relevant problem of determining optimal coordination protocols for multi-agent sequential decision making. The proposed BNP algorithm combined with STP is shown to work well in practice in various robotic applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Branch and Play, a novel algorithm that efficiently computes the socially optimal order of play for N-player Stackelberg trajectory games by implicitly exploring the combinatorial search space over possible leader-follower orderings using bounds from an extended sequential trajectory planning method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Branch and Play (B&P), an efficient algorithm that computes the socially optimal order of play and associated equilibrium strategy for N-player Stackelberg trajectory games. Specifically:

(a) The paper formulates the problem of finding the optimal order of play as a mixed-integer optimization problem over the space of permutations. 

(b) It introduces Branch and Play, an implicit enumeration algorithm with bounding, pruning, and exploration strategies to efficiently search for the socially optimal permutation. B&P is proved to converge to the global optimal solution.

(c) The paper employs and extends Sequential Trajectory Planning (STP) to compute valid local Stackelberg equilibria for any given order of play. It provides a proof that STP converges to a local Stackelberg equilibrium under certain assumptions.

(d) B&P is demonstrated on air traffic control, swarm quadrotor formation, and delivery vehicle coordination tasks. Experiments show B&P consistently outperforms baselines like first-come-first-served and Nash equilibrium strategies in terms of social cost.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of Branch and Play to efficiently compute the optimal order of play and associated equilibrium for multi-agent Stackelberg games, along with analysis and experimental validation. The integration with STP also enables B&P to scale to problems with many agents.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of an "incomplete permutation" to help prune the search space. Can you explain this concept in more detail and how it helps reduce the complexity of finding the optimal order of play?

2. The paper proves that Sequential Trajectory Planning (STP) converges to a local Stackelberg equilibrium. Walk through the key details of this proof and the assumptions it relies on. 

3. Expound on the exploration, pruning, and convergence properties of the Branch and Play (B&P) algorithm. What customizations can be made to improve performance?

4. The paper connects STP to computing Stackelberg equilibria with lexicographic preferences. Elaborate on this connection and discuss if/how the guarantees change.  

5. What modifications would need to be made to compute a generalized Stackelberg equilibrium using constrained trajectory optimization within STP?

6. The safety cost formulation makes a key assumption about the separability of individual and interactive costs. Discuss the limitations of this formulation and cases where it would not apply.  

7. The paper proposes a warm-starting procedure for receding horizon planning. Explain this procedure and how it can accelerate the online performance.

8. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using ILQR within STP for computing equilibria. When would this not be an appropriate solver choice?

9. The complexity of B&P scales factorially in the worst case but appears to perform much better in practice. Analyze why this is the case based on the pruning strategies. 

10. What are some key limitations of the overall approach? Discuss opportunities for improvements in terms of computational performance, problem scale, and more general applications.
