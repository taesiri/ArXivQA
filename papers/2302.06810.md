# [Learning from Noisy Labels with Decoupled Meta Label Purifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06810)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to accurately correct noisy labels to improve robustness of deep neural networks trained on noisy labeled data. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Decoupling the optimization of model weights and label distributions can improve the quality of corrected labels and representations compared to jointly optimizing them.

2) A non-nested meta label purifier with two mutually reinforcing correction processes (intrinsic primary correction and extrinsic auxiliary correction) can accurately correct noisy labels even under high noise levels. 

3) The purified labels from the proposed approach can be used to improve performance of deep networks trained on noisy data, either through direct retraining or by integrating with existing learning-with-noisy-labels methods.

The overall goal is to develop a flexible and effective approach for learning robust deep networks from noisy labeled data by accurately correcting the noisy labels. The central hypothesis is that decoupling representation learning from label correction and using a specially designed non-nested meta label purifier will enable high quality label correction even under extreme noise levels.
