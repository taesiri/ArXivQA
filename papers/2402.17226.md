## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Reasoning in Conversation: Solving Subjective Tasks through Dialogue Simulation for Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on objective tasks like question answering and mathematical reasoning. However, their performance on subjective tasks like metaphor recognition and opinion analysis is still lacking. 
- Subjective tasks require interpreting nuances, emotions, and personal experiences, which is difficult for current LLMs. 
- Existing methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting are effective for objective tasks but do not work as well for subjective tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Reasoning in Conversation (RiC)", a method to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities for subjective tasks through dialogue simulation.
- The key idea is that dialogue provides a means to convey emotions, opinions, and contextual knowledge, which can facilitate reasoning on subjective tasks.
- RiC has 3 main steps:
   1. Extract key task-relevant words from the input
   2. Generate a 1-2 turn simulated dialogue based on the keywords
   3. Reason and give a final answer using both the original input and simulated dialogue

Main Contributions:
- Proposes RiC, a tuning-free method to leverage knowledge from simulated dialogues to help solve subjective tasks
- Evaluates RiC on 12 datasets of 5 types using GPT-4, ChatGPT and OpenChat
- Shows significant consistent improvements under both zero-shot and few-shot settings
- Analyses reveal simulated dialogues provide useful knowledge like sentiments, explanations, expertise to facilitate reasoning
- First work focusing on enhancing reasoning abilities of LLMs specifically for subjective tasks through dialogues

In summary, the paper addresses the limitations of LLMs on subjective tasks by innovatively utilizing simulated human-like dialogues to uncover nuances and contextual knowledge to aid in reasoning and outperforms previous methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called Reasoning in Conversation (RiC) to enhance the ability of large language models to solve subjective reasoning tasks by simulating helpful dialogues instead of supplying chain-of-thought style rationales.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "RiC" (Reasoning in Conversation) to enhance the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve subjective tasks through dialogue simulation. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Proposing to leverage simulated dialogues to provide useful contextual information instead of more objective chain-of-thought style rationales, thereby offering helpful knowledge behind dialogues to aid reasoning on subjective tasks.

2) The RiC method comprises three main stages: keywords extraction, dialogue simulation, and dialogue-enhanced reasoning. It allows LLMs to extract task-relevant keywords, construct brief dialogues based on the keywords, and finally engage in reasoning based on both the original question and simulated dialogue.

3) Conducting comprehensive experiments on both API-based and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT and OpenChat. Results validate that RiC leads to significant and consistent improvement compared to various baselines under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

4) Providing analysis and case studies to demonstrate that the simulated dialogues can offer useful knowledge behind conversations such as sentiment tendencies, explanations, cultural backgrounds, etc. to facilitate reasoning on subjective tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is using dialogue simulation to unlock knowledge behind conversations that can aid in solving subjective tasks, which is an innovative direction for improving the capability of LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Here are some key terms and concepts related to this paper:

- Subjective tasks: Tasks that involve interpretation, judgment, personal experiences rather than objective/universally accepted reasoning (e.g. metaphor recognition, sarcasm detection)

- Large language models (LLMs): Advanced neural network models trained on large amounts of text data that can generate human-like text (e.g. GPT-3, PaLM, ChatGPT)  

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: Method to improve reasoning of LLMs by providing additional rationale or reasoning steps (works well for objective tasks)

- Dialogue simulation: Proposed method that constructs brief dialogues based on extracted keywords to provide useful contextual information for subjective tasks 

- Reasoning in Conversation (RiC): Key proposed method to improve LLM performance on subjective tasks by leveraging knowledge extracted from simulated dialogues

- Zero-shot learning: Evaluating model performance without providing any demonstrations or training examples

- Few-shot learning: Evaluating model after providing a small number of demonstrations with labels 

Key terms also include the various subjective task datasets used for evaluation (SNARKS, Dark Humor Detection, Pronoun Resolution, etc.) and the baselines compared against (Direct Prompt, Zero-Shot CoT, In-Context Learning, etc.).
