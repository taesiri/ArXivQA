# [Reasoning in Conversation: Solving Subjective Tasks through Dialogue   Simulation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Reasoning in Conversation: Solving Subjective Tasks through Dialogue Simulation for Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on objective tasks like question answering and mathematical reasoning. However, their performance on subjective tasks like metaphor recognition and opinion analysis is still lacking. 
- Subjective tasks require interpreting nuances, emotions, and personal experiences, which is difficult for current LLMs. 
- Existing methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting are effective for objective tasks but do not work as well for subjective tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Reasoning in Conversation (RiC)", a method to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities for subjective tasks through dialogue simulation.
- The key idea is that dialogue provides a means to convey emotions, opinions, and contextual knowledge, which can facilitate reasoning on subjective tasks.
- RiC has 3 main steps:
   1. Extract key task-relevant words from the input
   2. Generate a 1-2 turn simulated dialogue based on the keywords
   3. Reason and give a final answer using both the original input and simulated dialogue

Main Contributions:
- Proposes RiC, a tuning-free method to leverage knowledge from simulated dialogues to help solve subjective tasks
- Evaluates RiC on 12 datasets of 5 types using GPT-4, ChatGPT and OpenChat
- Shows significant consistent improvements under both zero-shot and few-shot settings
- Analyses reveal simulated dialogues provide useful knowledge like sentiments, explanations, expertise to facilitate reasoning
- First work focusing on enhancing reasoning abilities of LLMs specifically for subjective tasks through dialogues

In summary, the paper addresses the limitations of LLMs on subjective tasks by innovatively utilizing simulated human-like dialogues to uncover nuances and contextual knowledge to aid in reasoning and outperforms previous methods.
