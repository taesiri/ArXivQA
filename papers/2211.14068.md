# [Fine-Grained Face Swapping via Regional GAN Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14068)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve high-fidelity face swapping that faithfully preserves desired subtle geometry and texture details. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- The paper rethinks face swapping from the perspective of fine-grained face editing, proposing an "editing for swapping" (E4S) framework. This involves explicitly disentangling the shape and texture of facial components to enable both global and local swapping.

- A novel Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method is proposed to enable disentanglement and high-fidelity editing in the latent space of StyleGAN. This allows representing texture via regional style codes and shape via masks.

- Face swapping is reformulated as a simplified problem of swapping style codes and masks between source and target faces. The framework is inherently capable of handling facial occlusions using masks.

- Experiments demonstrate superiority over previous face swapping methods in preserving identity and details. The explicit disentanglement also enables applications like face editing and controlling extent of swapping.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that disentangling facial geometry/texture and reformulating face swapping as editing of these components can achieve higher fidelity results. The proposed E4S framework and RGI method aim to validate this hypothesis.
