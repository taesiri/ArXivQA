# [Fine-Grained Face Swapping via Regional GAN Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14068)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve high-fidelity face swapping that faithfully preserves desired subtle geometry and texture details. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- The paper rethinks face swapping from the perspective of fine-grained face editing, proposing an "editing for swapping" (E4S) framework. This involves explicitly disentangling the shape and texture of facial components to enable both global and local swapping.

- A novel Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method is proposed to enable disentanglement and high-fidelity editing in the latent space of StyleGAN. This allows representing texture via regional style codes and shape via masks.

- Face swapping is reformulated as a simplified problem of swapping style codes and masks between source and target faces. The framework is inherently capable of handling facial occlusions using masks.

- Experiments demonstrate superiority over previous face swapping methods in preserving identity and details. The explicit disentanglement also enables applications like face editing and controlling extent of swapping.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that disentangling facial geometry/texture and reformulating face swapping as editing of these components can achieve higher fidelity results. The proposed E4S framework and RGI method aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They propose a new framework called "Editing for Swapping" (E4S) for high-fidelity face swapping. This framework explicitly disentangles the shape and texture of facial components to better preserve identity information during swapping. 

2. They develop a novel Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method that allows disentanglement of shape and texture in the latent space of StyleGAN. This enables fine-grained control over facial components for swapping and editing.

3. Their E4S framework with RGI achieves superior results compared to prior face swapping and editing methods. It can generate high-resolution (1024x1024) swapped faces while preserving subtle details related to identity. 

4. The explicit disentanglement of shape and texture also allows the E4S framework to naturally handle occlusions and skin color preservation during face swapping.

5. Beyond face swapping, they demonstrate the RGI method can enable controllable fine-grained editing of facial components like eyes, mouth, etc.

In summary, the key innovation is the E4S framework and RGI method that disentangle shape/texture for high-fidelity face manipulation at both global and local levels. This represents an advance over previous face swapping and editing techniques.
