# [Exploring the Generalization of Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility   Classifiers Across Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17135)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Clinical trials are critical for evaluating new treatments, but patient recruitment is challenging. NLP methods can help by automatically classifying eligibility criteria, but prior work has focused narrowly on cancer trials.  
- Assessing model generalizability to other diseases is important for enabling patient matching across ClinicalTrials.gov.

Methods:
- Compiled eligibility criteria from 500 trials across 5 cohorts: phase 3 cancer trials, phase 1/2 cancer trials, heart disease trials, diabetes trials, and observational trials.
- Annotated 2,490 criteria statements for 7 exclusions: prior cancer, HIV, psychiatric illness, hepatitis B/C, substance abuse, autoimmune disease. 
- Evaluated ClinicalBERT and ClinicalTrialBERT models pretrained on phase 3 cancer trials from prior dataset. Assessed performance on new cohorts to test generalization.
- Also explored fine-tuning with 5/10/15 examples per criteria/cohort to simulate limited disease-specific data.

Results:
- Models struggled on criteria disproportionately prevalent in cancer like prior malignancy, but handled exclusions common across diseases.
- Observational trials performed worst due to looser eligibility criteria.
- Fine-tuning with more disease-specific examples improved performance, but small samples are not always feasible.

Contributions:
- New annotated dataset of 2,490 eligibility criteria statements across diverse clinical trials to enable generalizability research.
- Analysis showing eligibility classifiers pre-trained on cancer trials can generalize reasonably to related diseases but struggle on unrelated trials.
- Demonstration that fine-tuning on small disease-specific samples can help, but performance still lags behind in-domain training.
- Underscores need for more generalizable NLP models for recruiting across ClinicalTrials.gov.
