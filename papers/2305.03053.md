# ZipIt! Merging Models from Different Tasks without Training

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that it is possible to merge models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. Specifically, the paper introduces a method called "ZipIt!" that aims to merge models with different initializations that were trained on disjoint datasets and label spaces. The key ideas and contributions are:- Prior work on model merging assumes the models lie in the same "loss basin" modulo permutation. This fails when merging models trained on different tasks, as they may lie in different loss basins.- ZipIt introduces two main strategies to enable merging models from different tasks:   1) Merging redundant features both within and across models, not just permuting one model onto the other.   2) Partially zipping models only up to a certain layer to create a multi-head model, rather than merging the entire network.- Experiments show ZipIt significantly outperforms baselines like weight averaging and prior work like Git Re-Basin when merging models trained on disjoint subsets of CIFAR and ImageNet categories.- Analysis provides insight into the method, showing the benefits of within-model merging, partial zipping, and increased model capacity.In summary, the main hypothesis is that models trained on completely different tasks can be merged without additional training using the proposed ZipIt approach, which is demonstrated through extensive experiments and analysis. The key ideas are merging within and across models and partial zipping.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces "ZipIt!", a method for merging models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. The key contributions are:- Proposes a general framework to merge models layer-by-layer by exploiting redundancy in their features. This allows merging models with different architectures trained on separate tasks.- Introduces two main strategies: 1) Allows merging features both within and across models, instead of just permuting one model to align with the other. 2) Partial zipping, where only initial layers are merged to create a multi-head model, avoiding issues when later layer features diverge. - Shows strong experimental results merging models trained on disjoint subsets of CIFAR and ImageNet categories. Significantly outperforms prior work like Git Re-Basin, and approaches ensemble performance.- Demonstrates merging models trained on completely separate datasets (Stanford Dogs, Oxford Pets, etc) without any training. Again outperforms baselines.- Analyzes the approach, showing the benefits of within-model merging and partial zipping. Reveals it makes effective use of model capacity.In summary, the main contribution is a general framework for merging models trained on separate tasks without any additional training. The key ideas are merging features within models and partial zipping to create multi-head models. Experiments show large improvements over prior work in this challenging setting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces ZipIt!, a method for merging neural network models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work on model merging:- Focuses on merging models trained on disjoint tasks rather than the same task. Most prior work like Model Soups, Git Re-Basin, and REPAIR merge models that were trained on the same dataset and task. ZipIt! tackles the more challenging problem of merging models trained on totally separate datasets and label spaces.- Allows merging features within models, not just across models. Previous permutation-based approaches like Git Re-Basin only match features across the two models being merged. ZipIt! matches features within each model as well, helping account for non-overlapping information. - Introduces partial zipping to create multi-task models. By stopping the merge process partway through the network, ZipIt! leaves some layers separate to form a natural multi-head model. This is a novel technique not explored in prior work.- Achieves strong performance without extra training. The paper shows ZipIt! significantly outperforms baselines like weight averaging and permutation, merging models from disjoint CIFAR and ImageNet splits. It does this without any additional training, unlike distillation techniques.- Analyzes method with different architectures and modalities. In addition to CNN classifiers, the paper shows ZipIt! can merge different SinGAN image generation models successfully. This demonstrates the general applicability. Overall, ZipIt! makes progress on the very difficult task of merging models from completely different domains. It outperforms prior work by better handling non-overlapping information and not requiring extra training. The analyses also surface insights about the method's capabilities and limitations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring different merge strategies besides the greedy feature matching approach used in this work. The authors mention optimal bipartite graph matching is slow, but other approaches like clustering or learned matching could be promising.- Applying ZipIt! to other domains beyond image classification, such as generative modeling, reinforcement learning, etc. The authors demonstrate a proof-of-concept on SinGAN, but more exploration could be done. - Testing ZipIt! on more complex definition of "tasks", beyond just disjoint label sets for classification. For example, models trained for detection vs segmentation, reinforcement learning environments with different goals, etc.- Exploring if techniques like knowledge distillation can be used along with ZipIt! to further improve accuracy when merging models. The current approach does not use any additional training.- Analyzing how the similarity of models affects merge quality, and using insights from this to selectively determine optimal merge points/layers.- Developing theoretical understanding of when and why ZipIt! works, building on analysis like mode connectivity.- Extending ZipIt! to handle models with different architectures, which is not supported currently.Overall, the paper sets up ZipIt! as a general framework for merging models without training, and suggests many interesting extensions to build on this in future work across domains, model similarity settings, theoretical analysis, and techniques to further improve merge quality.
