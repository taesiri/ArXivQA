# [ZipIt! Merging Models from Different Tasks without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03053)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that it is possible to merge models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. Specifically, the paper introduces a method called "ZipIt!" that aims to merge models with different initializations that were trained on disjoint datasets and label spaces. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Prior work on model merging assumes the models lie in the same "loss basin" modulo permutation. This fails when merging models trained on different tasks, as they may lie in different loss basins.

- ZipIt introduces two main strategies to enable merging models from different tasks:
   1) Merging redundant features both within and across models, not just permuting one model onto the other.
   2) Partially zipping models only up to a certain layer to create a multi-head model, rather than merging the entire network.

- Experiments show ZipIt significantly outperforms baselines like weight averaging and prior work like Git Re-Basin when merging models trained on disjoint subsets of CIFAR and ImageNet categories.

- Analysis provides insight into the method, showing the benefits of within-model merging, partial zipping, and increased model capacity.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that models trained on completely different tasks can be merged without additional training using the proposed ZipIt approach, which is demonstrated through extensive experiments and analysis. The key ideas are merging within and across models and partial zipping.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces "ZipIt!", a method for merging models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. The key contributions are:

- Proposes a general framework to merge models layer-by-layer by exploiting redundancy in their features. This allows merging models with different architectures trained on separate tasks.

- Introduces two main strategies: 1) Allows merging features both within and across models, instead of just permuting one model to align with the other. 2) Partial zipping, where only initial layers are merged to create a multi-head model, avoiding issues when later layer features diverge. 

- Shows strong experimental results merging models trained on disjoint subsets of CIFAR and ImageNet categories. Significantly outperforms prior work like Git Re-Basin, and approaches ensemble performance.

- Demonstrates merging models trained on completely separate datasets (Stanford Dogs, Oxford Pets, etc) without any training. Again outperforms baselines.

- Analyzes the approach, showing the benefits of within-model merging and partial zipping. Reveals it makes effective use of model capacity.

In summary, the main contribution is a general framework for merging models trained on separate tasks without any additional training. The key ideas are merging features within models and partial zipping to create multi-head models. Experiments show large improvements over prior work in this challenging setting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces ZipIt!, a method for merging neural network models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work on model merging:

- Focuses on merging models trained on disjoint tasks rather than the same task. Most prior work like Model Soups, Git Re-Basin, and REPAIR merge models that were trained on the same dataset and task. ZipIt! tackles the more challenging problem of merging models trained on totally separate datasets and label spaces.

- Allows merging features within models, not just across models. Previous permutation-based approaches like Git Re-Basin only match features across the two models being merged. ZipIt! matches features within each model as well, helping account for non-overlapping information. 

- Introduces partial zipping to create multi-task models. By stopping the merge process partway through the network, ZipIt! leaves some layers separate to form a natural multi-head model. This is a novel technique not explored in prior work.

- Achieves strong performance without extra training. The paper shows ZipIt! significantly outperforms baselines like weight averaging and permutation, merging models from disjoint CIFAR and ImageNet splits. It does this without any additional training, unlike distillation techniques.

- Analyzes method with different architectures and modalities. In addition to CNN classifiers, the paper shows ZipIt! can merge different SinGAN image generation models successfully. This demonstrates the general applicability. 

Overall, ZipIt! makes progress on the very difficult task of merging models from completely different domains. It outperforms prior work by better handling non-overlapping information and not requiring extra training. The analyses also surface insights about the method's capabilities and limitations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different merge strategies besides the greedy feature matching approach used in this work. The authors mention optimal bipartite graph matching is slow, but other approaches like clustering or learned matching could be promising.

- Applying ZipIt! to other domains beyond image classification, such as generative modeling, reinforcement learning, etc. The authors demonstrate a proof-of-concept on SinGAN, but more exploration could be done. 

- Testing ZipIt! on more complex definition of "tasks", beyond just disjoint label sets for classification. For example, models trained for detection vs segmentation, reinforcement learning environments with different goals, etc.

- Exploring if techniques like knowledge distillation can be used along with ZipIt! to further improve accuracy when merging models. The current approach does not use any additional training.

- Analyzing how the similarity of models affects merge quality, and using insights from this to selectively determine optimal merge points/layers.

- Developing theoretical understanding of when and why ZipIt! works, building on analysis like mode connectivity.

- Extending ZipIt! to handle models with different architectures, which is not supported currently.

Overall, the paper sets up ZipIt! as a general framework for merging models without training, and suggests many interesting extensions to build on this in future work across domains, model similarity settings, theoretical analysis, and techniques to further improve merge quality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces "ZipIt!", a method for merging deep neural network models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. The key insight is that prior work on model merging fails when merging models trained on disjoint tasks because it assumes most features are shared across models. To address this, ZipIt generalizes model merging to also merge redundant features within each model, not just across models, using a graph matching algorithm. Additionally, ZipIt supports partially zipping models only up to a certain layer to create a multi-head model, which is important when tasks are very different. Experiments show ZipIt significantly outperforms prior work, enabling merging of models trained on disjoint splits of CIFAR and ImageNet as well as models trained on completely different datasets. The method makes merging models trained independently on different tasks feasible.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces ZipIt!, a method for merging multiple deep neural network models trained on different tasks into a single multi-task model without any additional training. The key insight is that prior work on model merging fails when the models being merged are trained on completely different tasks, as their features spaces diverge. To address this, ZipIt! proposes two main strategies. 

First, ZipIt! generalizes model merging to allow matching and merging redundant features both within and across models. This accounts for disjoint features not shared between the models. Second, ZipIt! supports partially zipping models only up to a specified layer, naturally creating a multi-head model. This handles the increasing dissimilarity in features over network depth. Experiments on merging models trained on disjoint subsets of CIFAR and ImageNet categories as well as independent datasets show that ZipIt! significantly outperforms prior work. Ablations demonstrate the importance of both matching within models and partial zipping, especially as model and task complexity increases. Overall, ZipIt! makes merging models trained on different tasks feasible and serves as an effective framework for combining pre-trained models without additional training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces ZipIt!, a method for merging models trained on completely different tasks without any additional training. The key ideas are:

1) Prior work like Git Re-Basin assumes models lie in the same loss basin modulo permutation, and merges models by permuting one model to align with the other. However, this fails when models are trained on different tasks, as their features aren't aligned. 

2) To address this, ZipIt generalizes model merging to merge features both within and across models. It computes a merge matrix to combine redundant activations, propagating this through the network. This allows merging models even if their features aren't aligned across models.

3) ZipIt also supports partial zipping, where only some layers are merged. This leaves later layers separate, forming a natural multi-head model. This is important as later layers tend to diverge more between different tasks.

Together, these ideas allow ZipIt to successfully merge models trained on completely different tasks and datasets without any additional training. Experiments show it significantly outperforms prior work, getting close to ensemble performance on difficult merging tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes and evaluates a general method called "ZipIt!" for merging deep learning models trained on completely different tasks, without requiring any additional training. The key ideas are expanding model merging to match redundant features both within and across models, and partial zipping to create multi-task models. The main result is that these techniques enable successfully merging models trained on disjoint tasks where prior methods fail.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of merging multiple deep neural network models that have been trained on completely different tasks into a single model, without requiring any additional training. 

The key issues and challenges are:

- Prior work on model merging has focused on merging models that were trained on the same dataset and task. However, merging models trained on completely different datasets and tasks is much more challenging.

- Simply averaging the weights of models trained on different tasks results in very poor performance. Prior techniques like Git Re-Basin work by finding permutations to align the models before merging, but this assumes the models lie in similar loss basins, which does not hold when the models are solving different tasks.

- Models trained on disjoint tasks likely learn some distinct features that are not shared between the models. Existing techniques that merge models using 1-to-1 mappings fail to account for these non-shared features.

- Merging entire models end-to-end does not work well when models are trained on different tasks, as the later layers tend to diverge.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces "ZipIt!", a technique to merge models from different tasks without training that:

- Allows merging features within each model, not just across models, to better consolidate redundant and non-redundant features.

- Partially zips models only up to a certain layer to create a multi-head model that avoids merging incompatible layers.

- Uses a graph-based algorithm to flexibly merge features within and across models.

The key innovation is developing a general framework to merge arbitrary models that is not limited to aligning models through permutations, and handles challenges like non-shared features and incompatible layers.
