# [AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by Chaining   Large Language Model Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01691)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is: How can we improve human-AI interaction when using large language models (LLMs) for complex, multi-objective tasks? 

The authors note that while LLMs have shown promise on simple tasks when provided with a suitable prompt, they struggle with more complex tasks involving multiple steps of reasoning or multiple simultaneous objectives. This makes LLMs difficult for humans to collaborate with on real-world tasks. 

To address this, the authors introduce the notion of "Chaining" - breaking a complex task into a series of smaller sub-tasks, each handled by a separate LLM prompt. The output of one step becomes the input to the next, allowing gains at each step to accumulate. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that Chaining LLM prompts in this way will enable LLMs to contribute effectively to complex tasks, while also improving the transparency, controllability and user experience compared to having the LLM attempt the full complex task in one go.

The user study and case studies presented aim to evaluate whether Chaining improves outcomes, transparency, controllability etc. when interacting with LLMs, compared to a standard single-prompt interface.

Does this summary accurately capture the central research question? Let me know if you need any clarification on the paper's goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be introducing the concept of "chaining" large language model (LLM) prompts together to help users accomplish complex tasks with LLMs. Specifically:

- They introduce the notion of chaining multiple LLM prompts together, where the output of one prompt is used as the input to the next prompt. This allows breaking down a complex task into smaller sub-tasks that can each be handled better by the LLM. 

- They define a set of "LLM primitive operations" that represent functions that are well-scoped for a single LLM run. These serve as building blocks for constructing chains.

- They present an interactive interface that allows users to build, execute, and modify LLM chains by editing the prompts, intermediate data, and chain structure.

- Through a 20-person user study, they show that chaining can enhance the transparency, controllability, collaboration, and outcome quality compared to a non-chaining baseline. Users leveraged chaining for things like calibrating expectations, comparing strategies, and debugging.

- They demonstrate through case studies how chaining could enable applications like visualization debugging and assisted text entry where intermediate reasoning steps are useful.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating the concept of chaining multiple focused LLM runs together to improve the human experience of interacting with large language models on complex tasks. The notion of chaining and the interactive interface collectively represent a new method for prototyping AI-powered features using LLMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few ways this paper compares to other research in natural language processing and human-AI interaction:

- This paper introduces a new concept of "chaining" language model prompts together to allow humans to collaborate with AI on more complex tasks. Most prior work has focused on using large language models for isolated, simple tasks rather than chained, multi-step tasks.

- The paper evaluates the chained prompt approach through a controlled user study. Much language model research presents impressive demos, but lacks rigorous evaluation on how the systems affect end user experience. The user study quantitatively measures differences in perceived transparency, controllability, and outcomes.

- The chained prompt approach does not require changing the underlying model architecture or training procedure. This is different from other techniques like progressive prompting that require modifying the model to improve multi-step reasoning.

- This research focuses on improving the interaction mechanism for leveraging general-purpose LLMs. In contrast, most prior human-AI collaboration studies examine task-specific models for a single function.

- The concept of chaining draws inspiration from crowdsourcing workflows. However, the paper tailors the approach to address language model-specific challenges like lack of reasoning, exposure bias, and prompt sensitivity.

- The paper introduces language model "primitive operations" as building blocks for chains. This provides a useful taxonomy of capabilities to inform the design of human-AI systems.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in conceptualizing and evaluating how to chain language model prompts for complex tasks in a way that enhances human-AI collaboration. The interaction techniques and primitive operation design could inform future work on interfacing between humans and large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore different prompt engineering strategies and prompt templates to improve the effectiveness of chained prompts. The authors note that their default prompt templates are just one possible implementation, and further research could identify other effective prompting approaches for chaining.

- Investigate how to assist users in crafting chained steps to maximize utility and coherence, such as through guidance on iterative improvements or using version control principles when editing chains. This could help address potential issues with subtask interdependence in complex workflows.

- Study how users can author their own chains, rather than just using pre-defined chains. Giving users more agency in defining chains could improve intuitiveness and match users' own task decomposition mental models.

- Examine hybrid human-AI chains that interleave both human computation and LLM steps. This could help determine optimal division of labor between human and AI based on their complementary capabilities.

- Explore using LLMs themselves to aid chain construction, such as through meta-prompting to help generate subtasks or using LLMs for example generation. This could leverage LLMs' own strengths to improve chain design.

- Investigate balancing structured scaffolding from chaining with opportunities for freeform exploration, such as through sandbox environments or customization within chain steps. This could enable both guided assistance and open-ended tinkering.

- Evaluate chaining for rapid prototyping of AI-infused applications, taking advantage of reusable building blocks. The authors propose this as a promising direction.

- Address cascading errors and information loss from inter-step dependence in complex chains. The paper notes these issues but doesn't provide solutions.

In summary, key directions include enhancing chain design, supporting authoring, blending human-AI capabilities, and applying chaining to new domains like prototyping. Balancing structure with flexibility is also noted as an important consideration.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an interactive system that allows users to chain multiple prompts for large language models (LLMs) together, with the output of one prompt acting as the input for the next. It breaks down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks that are each handled by a separate LLM prompt. The system provides a set of default LLM "primitive operations" for common tasks like classification, information extraction, etc. that users can incorporate into chains. It has an interface that visualizes the chain structure and allows editing the prompts, intermediate data, and overall chain. A 20-person study found the system increased transparency, controllability, collaboration, and task quality compared to a standard LLM interface. Case studies showed it enabling applications like visualization debugging and text expansion. In summary, the system and notion of chaining prompts allows improving LLM-powered tasks and user experience, without changing the underlying LLM model.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for complex, multi-step tasks. While LLMs perform well on simple, narrow tasks through prompt engineering, they struggle with more open-ended, multi-objective tasks that require reasoning across steps. The authors propose "chaining" together multiple runs of an LLM to accomplish sub-tasks that play to the model's strengths. 

Paragraph 2: The authors define a set of "primitive operations" that can be chained together, like classification, information extraction, and composition. They build an interface for chaining these operations with customizable prompts and data passing between steps. In a user study, chaining improved outcomes and user experience dimensions like transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration compared to a single LLM call. The paper concludes by discussing challenges and future directions like supporting user authoring of chains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The authors developed a chaining approach to improve human-LLM interaction for complex tasks. They first defined a set of LLM primitive operations that are well-scoped for a single model run. They then created an interactive interface where users can construct chains of LLM steps, with each step corresponding to a primitive operation. The interface visualizes the chain structure and allows users to iterate on the prompts, intermediate data, and overall chaining configuration. To evaluate chaining, the authors conducted a 20-person within-subject study comparing chaining against a standard sandbox interface on two tasks. Quantitative measures and qualitative feedback showed chaining improved transparency, controllability, collaboration, mental support, and task outcomes. The results highlight the benefits of decomposing problems into smaller sub-tasks and exposing intermediate model outputs to users.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, it appears this paper is addressing how to enable large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to better support complex, multi-step human activities in a more transparent and controllable way. Some key points:

- LLMs tend to perform well on simple, narrow tasks but struggle with more complex, real-world tasks that require reasoning across multiple steps. 

- LLMs can also be opaque and difficult to interact with/debug due to their broad scope and lack of transparency.

- This paper introduces the notion of "Chaining" - breaking down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, each mapped to a distinct LLM prompt. The output of one step becomes the input to the next.

- They define a set of "LLM primitive operations" that represent functions well-suited to a single LLM run and can help address common LLM challenges.

- They present an interactive interface for users to execute and customize LLM Chains in a modular way, providing more transparency and control.

- Through a user study, they show Chaining can improve outcomes, transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration compared to a standard LLM interface.

So in summary, the key problem is enabling LLMs to support complex human tasks more effectively through increased transparency, controllability, and multi-step reasoning. Chaining LLM prompts is proposed as a solution.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of "Chaining" multiple large language model (LLM) prompts together to improve human-AI collaboration on complex tasks. Chaining involves breaking down a complex task into smaller sub-tasks, each handled by a separate LLM prompt, with the output of one step becoming the input to the next.
