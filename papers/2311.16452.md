# [Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case   Study in Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16452)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores methods for steering large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to excel at medical question answering without requiring specialized fine-tuning or expert-crafted prompting strategies. The authors introduce Medprompt, a general prompting approach combining dynamic few-shot example selection, LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning, and choice shuffle ensembling. On all 9 benchmark datasets in MultiMedQA, including the MedQA exam dataset, GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming prior specialized models like Med-PaLM 2. For MedQA specifically, Medprompt enables over 90% accuracy for the first time. Ablation studies reveal the relative contributions of each Medprompt component. Further experiments on exams in non-medical domains demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. While optimistic about the potential, the authors caution about real-world efficacy and outline limitations around potential benchmark contamination, hallucinations, and bias that warrant further investigation. Overall, the work highlights the latent specialist capabilities within generalist LLMs that can be unlocked with systematic prompt engineering, without a need for specialization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates that systematic prompt engineering can unlock specialist medical capabilities in the generalist GPT-4 model, allowing it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical question answering datasets without specialized fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing and evaluating a prompting strategy called Medprompt that can unlock specialist medical capabilities in the GPT-4 foundation model without requiring specialized fine-tuning or reliance on human expert-crafted prompts. Specifically:

1) Medprompt combines dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain-of-thought, and choice shuffle ensembling to steer GPT-4 to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical QA datasets, outperforming prior specialist models like Med-PaLM 2. 

2) The techniques used in Medprompt are general purpose and do not rely on medical expertise or domain-specific data. The approach is shown to transfer effectively to exams in other domains like electrical engineering, law, and psychology.

3) The paper demonstrates that GPT-4 can automatically generate high-quality chain-of-thought rationales that improve its accuracy over expert-written ones, highlighting its emergent self-improving capabilities. 

4) The methodology and experiments focus on maximizing accuracy while minimizing inference cost, rather than resorting to expensive fine-tuning or prompting techniques.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and rigorously evaluating Medprompt, an efficient yet powerful prompting strategy that can unlock specialist skills in generalist foundation models like GPT-4. The techniques underlying Medprompt are general and transferable across domains.

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Foundation models - The paper focuses on studying the capabilities of large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 that are trained on massive datasets to perform general tasks. These models are referred to as "foundation models."

- Prompt engineering - A major theme of the paper is using innovative prompting strategies to unlock the specialist capabilities of foundation models without additional fine-tuning. This process is called "prompt engineering."

- Medical competency benchmarks - The paper specifically looks at the ability of models to perform well on challenge questions from medical licensing exams. These are referred to as "medical competency benchmarks."

- MultiMedQA - This is the name of the benchmark suite containing 9 medical question answering datasets that are used to evaluate performance.

- Medprompt - The name given to the prompting strategy devised in this paper that combines dynamic few-shot selection, chain of thought, and choice shuffle ensembling. 

- Chain of thought (CoT) - One of the prompt engineering techniques, using intermediate reasoning steps as part of the prompt context.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a prompting strategy called "Medprompt" that combines dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain of thought, and choice shuffle ensembling. Can you explain in more detail how the self-generated chain of thought component works? What template does the model use to generate chain of thought explanations automatically?

2. The ablation study shows that introducing chain of thought reasoning leads to the biggest performance gain on the MedQA dataset. Why do you think chain of thought is so impactful compared to the other techniques explored? Are there any downsides or limitations to relying on self-generated reasoning chains?

3. The paper argues that Medprompt is a general purpose prompting strategy and not restricted to the medical domain, despite its name. What evidence is provided to support this claim? What modifications would be needed to apply the Medprompt framework to open-ended text generation tasks instead of multiple choice questions?

4. Dynamic few-shot selection relies on finding similar examples at inference time using a nearest neighbor search. What are some limitations of this approach? Could curriculum learning be used to better select examples over time? 

5. The choice shuffle ensemble technique is used to reduce position bias. Does this completely eliminate bias or just reduce it? Could more advanced debiasing techniques like REPAIR be combined with Medprompt?

6. What best practices does the paper adopt to avoid overfitting during the prompt engineering process? Do you think the evidence provided conclusively shows that overfitting was avoided? What additional analyses could be done?

7. The ablation study estimates the relative contribution of each Medprompt component. What are some limitations of the incremental approach used? How could using Shapley values provide a more accurate attribution method?

8. How expensive computationally is Medprompt compared to approaches that rely on fine-tuning? Could methods like prompt pruning or prompt distillation help reduce the cost?

9. The paper does not compare against hybrid approaches that combine prompting strategies with fine-tuning. Why not explore combinations and would you expect further gains from joint optimization?

10. What risks, limitations and biases around use of Medprompt in real clinical settings does the paper discuss? Do you see any additional concerns not covered around safety, fairness and responsible AI?
