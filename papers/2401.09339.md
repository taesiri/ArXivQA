# [Central Limit Theorem for Two-Timescale Stochastic Approximation with   Markovian Noise: Theory and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09339)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms, which are iterative stochastic algorithms with two interacting sequences of iterates that converge at different rates. TTSA has many applications like distributed learning and reinforcement learning. The paper focuses on the case where the stochastic input sequence is a controlled Markov chain, meaning it depends on the iterates. Previous works have mostly studied TTSA with independent noise. Analyzing the Markovian noise case poses challenges and requires new techniques.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides a central limit theorem (CLT) that characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the TTSA iterates. Using Poisson equation techniques from Markov chain theory, the authors transform the TTSA updates into a single-timescale stochastic approximation form to establish the CLT. The limiting covariance matrix captures the effect of the coupled dynamics and underlying Markov chain. This generalizes prior CLT results that only apply for TTSA with independent noise.

Based on the CLT, the paper shows TTSA algorithms driven by more efficient Markov chains have better asymptotic performance. It also uses the CLT to analyze gradient TD algorithms in reinforcement learning with nonlinear function approximation, proving they have identical limiting behavior. This perspective is not available from existing non-asymptotic analyses.

Main Contributions:
- First CLT result for nonlinear TTSA with controlled Markovian noise under general decreasing step sizes 

- Demonstrates improved asymptotic performance for TTSA algorithms using more efficient sampling strategies, expanding similar conclusions for SGD to bilevel and minimax optimization

- Provides novel statistical characterization and comparison of nonlinear gradient TD algorithms using Markovian samples, which finite-time analyses cannot offer

- The CLT and its applications showcase the significance of asymptotic analysis to facilitate algorithmic improvements and theoretical comparisons in broader stochastic optimization contexts

In summary, the paper establishes an impactful CLT for TTSA algorithms with Markovian noise and highlights its usefulness through applications in distributed learning and reinforcement learning. The results greatly expand the scope of prior asymptotic analyses concentrated on simpler independent noise settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper establishes a central limit theorem for the asymptotic behavior of two-timescale stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise, and leverages this result to analyze the impact of sampling strategies on optimization performance as well as compare gradient-based temporal difference learning algorithms in reinforcement learning using nonlinear function approximation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a central limit theorem (CLT) for the asymptotic behavior of two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms under controlled Markovian noise. The key contributions are:

1) It establishes a CLT for the iterates of nonlinear TTSA algorithms with locally Lipschitz continuous functions and controlled Markovian noise. This generalizes prior CLT results that focused only on TTSA with martingale difference noise or linear settings. 

2) It demonstrates how the CLT can be used to compare the asymptotic performance of TTSA algorithms under different Markov chain sampling strategies. More efficient chains lead to lower asymptotic covariance. This expands similar conclusions from SGD to the broader TTSA context.

3) It applies the CLT to analyze gradient temporal difference (GTD) reinforcement learning algorithms with nonlinear function approximation. It shows GTD2 and TDC have identical asymptotic covariance, giving new insights compared to existing finite-time analyses. 

Overall, the paper develops a foundational CLT for an important class of stochastic algorithms, with applications to distributed optimization and reinforcement learning. It highlights the value of asymptotic statistics to guide algorithm design and analysis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper establishes a central limit theorem (CLT) for two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms under Markovian noise. How does accounting for the bias induced by the Markovian noise make the analysis more challenging compared to prior work on TTSA with martingale difference noise?

2. The paper shows that by approximating the faster timescale iterates ($\rvy_n$) with an implicit function of the slower timescale iterates ($\rvx_n$), the TTSA algorithm can be transformed into an approximate single timescale stochastic approximation. What is the intuition behind this transformation and why does it enable utilizing existing CLT results?

3. The limiting covariance matrices ($\rmV_{\rvx}$, $\rmV_{\rvy}$) in the established CLT capture the joint dynamics of the coupled TTSA iterates influenced by the underlying Markov chain. How can these covariance matrices be leveraged to compare asymptotic performance of TTSA algorithms driven by different Markov chains?

4. Proposition 3.2 states that more sampling-efficient Markov chains lead to lower asymptotic covariance in TTSA algorithms. Does this result also hold for non-asymptotic performance measures? What experiments could be conducted to verify this?  

5. The paper applies the established CLT to analyze asymptotic properties of nonlinear TD learning algorithms in reinforcement learning. What practical insights does the identical asymptotic performance of GTD2 and TDC provide that were not evident from existing finite-time analyses?

6. The CLT scaling factors ($\beta_n^{-1/2}$, $\gamma_n^{-1/2}$) suggest asymptotic independence between the slower and faster timescale iterates. Does this align with intuition? What dependencies may still exist between the iterates?

7. Lemma A.2.7 indicates the off-diagonal terms in the joint CLT decrease at a rate faster than the diagonal terms. How is this rate derived and what does it imply about the evolution of coupled variables?

8. The proof of tight bounds on residual terms ($R_n^{(\rvx)}$, $R_n^{(\rvy)}$, $\Delta_n^{(\rvx)}$, $\Delta_n^{(\rvy)}$) involves intricate analysis. What challenges arise in controlling these terms compared to prior work?

9. Could the established CLT be extended to the case where $h_1, h_2$ are set-valued functions as studied by \citet{yaji2020stochastic}? What additional mathematical tools would be needed?

10. A key condition is the stability of iterates (Assumption A5). If this assumption is violated, how could the TTSA algorithm be modified to enforce bounded iterates, and what would be the impact on the CLT?
