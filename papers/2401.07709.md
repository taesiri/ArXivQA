# [Towards Efficient Diffusion-Based Image Editing with Instant Attention   Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion-based image editing methods rely on manually created or off-line generated masks to control the editing region. However, manual mask creation is time-consuming and hinders automated editing. Recently proposed automated masking methods like DiffEdit have high computational costs. There is a need for an efficient automated editing method.

Method: 
The paper proposes a novel method called Instant Diffusion Editing (InstDiffEdit) for efficient automated masking and editing with diffusion models. Key ideas:

1) Leverage cross-modal attention in diffusion models to instantly generate masks at each denoising timestep. However, attention maps are noisy so a refinement scheme is proposed.

2) Refinement scheme uses similarities between the attention map of the start token (full sentence info) and other tokens to filter noise and identify target region. Adaptive aggregation further refines the mask.

3) Generated masks provide instant guidance to denoising process for editing. Final edit uses inpainting with last timestep's mask for quality.

4) InstDiffEdit is training-free and a plug-and-play component for existing diffusion models.

Contributions:
1) Proposes InstDiffEdit - an efficient automated editing method using instant attention mask generation. Enables editing 5-6x faster than prior art.

2) Learning-free mask refinement scheme to handle noise in attention maps. Enables fully automated editing.

3) New benchmark dataset Editing-Mask with human-labeled masks to directly evaluate editing methods.

Results:
- Outperforms SOTA automated method DiffEdit in mask IOU (+70%) and changing rate (+50%) on Editing-Mask showing more accurate editing.  

- Lower LPIPS on ImageNet and Imagen vs DiffEdit confirming better edit quality and preservation.

- 5-6x speedup over DiffEdit with comparable quality showing efficiency.

The summary covers the key problem being solved, the proposed instant attention masking solution and associated schemes, the ability to be training-free and plug-and-play, the new benchmark dataset introduced, and both quantitative and qualitative results showing state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient image editing method called Instant Diffusion Editing (InstDiffEdit) that generates instant attention masks during diffusion model denoising steps to guide local edits, outperforming previous methods in speed and quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are three-fold:

1. It proposes a novel and efficient image editing method for diffusion-based models called Instant Diffusion Editing (InstDiffEdit). InstDiffEdit exploits the cross-modal attention ability of existing diffusion models to achieve instant mask guidance during the diffusion steps for semantic image editing.

2. InstDiffEdit is a plug-and-play component that can be applied to most diffusion models for semantic image editing without requiring additional training or human intervention. Experiments show its performance is state-of-the-art. 

3. The paper proposes a new image editing benchmark called Editing-Mask to examine the mask accuracy and local editing ability of existing methods. This benchmark contains 200 images with human-labeled masks.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) the proposed InstDiffEdit method for efficient diffusion-based image editing, (2) InstDiffEdit as a plug-and-play and training-free component for diffusion models, and (3) the new Editing-Mask benchmark for evaluating editing methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Instant Diffusion Editing (InstDiffEdit): The name of the proposed novel and efficient image editing method for diffusion models. It aims to achieve instant mask guidance during diffusion steps by exploiting cross-modal attention.

- Diffusion models: The class of generative models that InstDiffEdit is designed to work with, which involves a noise injection and gradual denoising process. Examples are Stable Diffusion and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). 

- Semantic image editing: The task that InstDiffEdit aims to address, which is modifying a target instance in an image according to a text description while preserving other information. 

- Attention maps/distributions: The cross-modal alignments between text and images captured in diffusion models, which InstDiffEdit leverages to generate instant masks.

- Mask refinement: A key component of InstDiffEdit which refines and adapts the noisy attention maps to automatically generate accurate semantic masks for editing guidance.

- Editing-Mask dataset: A new proposed benchmark dataset containing human-labeled masks to evaluate local editing ability and mask accuracy.

- Inference speed/efficiency: A key advantage of InstDiffEdit over prior diffusion editing methods, demonstrated through quantitative experiments.
