# [Towards Faithful Explanations for Text Classification with Robustness   Improvement and Explanation Guided Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Explanation methods like feature attribution highlight important input tokens to explain model predictions. However, recent works show these explanations can lack faithfulness and robustness. For example, similar models can provide different explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method called REGEX that improves the faithfulness of highlight explanations in text classification via:
  1) Robustness Improvement: Apply input gradient regularization and virtual adversarial training to improve model robustness.
  2) Explanation Guided Training (EGT): Iteratively mask tokens with low attribution scores. Maximize similarity between new attention scores and attributions to encourage focusing on salient words. Minimize KL divergence between attention distributions of original and masked input.

Main Contributions:
- Propose REGEX method to improve faithfulness of highlight explanations by improving model robustness and incorporating explanations in a self-training manner.
- Conduct extensive experiments on 6 datasets with 5 attribution methods in in-domain and out-of-domain settings. REGEX improves faithfulness metrics and achieves consistent gains based on two randomization tests.
- Apply explanations from REGEX to train select-then-predict models with comparable performance to end-to-end method, showing usefulness of more faithful explanations.
- Analysis shows REGEX improves explanation robustness. Results suggest considering model robustness yields more faithful explanations, shedding light on connection between explainability and robustness.

In summary, the paper explores improving faithfulness of highlight explanations by robustness improvement and explanation guided training. Extensive experiments demonstrate REGEX generates more faithful explanations, and analysis provides insights into the relationship between robustness and explainability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve the faithfulness of highlight explanations for text classification by enhancing model robustness through input gradient regularization and virtual adversarial training, and incorporating explanations to guide the model training in a self-supervised manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The paper explores how to improve the faithfulness of highlight explanations generated by feature attribution methods in text classification tasks.

2. The paper proposes an explanation guided training mechanism towards more faithful attributions, which encourages the model to learn from input importance during training to reduce the effect of noisy tokens. 

3. The paper empirically demonstrates through extensive experiments on 6 datasets that the proposed REGEX method generates more faithful explanations, suggesting that considering model robustness can yield more faithful explanations.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a method to generate more faithful highlight explanations by improving model robustness and incorporating an explanation guided training approach. The empirical results support the idea that there is a connection between model robustness and explainability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Faithful explanations - The paper focuses on improving the faithfulness (accuracy in representing the model's reasoning) of highlight explanations generated by feature attribution methods for text classification models.

- Robustness improvement - The paper proposes improving model robustness through input gradient regularization and virtual adversarial training as a way to also improve explanation faithfulness.

- Explanation guided training (EGT) - A proposed method that masks low-salience tokens and minimizes the KL divergence between the model's attention and feature attributions to encourage the model to learn from input importance. 

- Sufficiency and comprehensiveness - Metrics used to evaluate the faithfulness of explanations by measuring if the highlights are adequate for the model to make predictions and influence the predictions.

- In-domain vs. out-of-domain - Experiments are conducted to test explanation faithfulness when models are tested on datasets from different distributions than what they were trained on.

- Select-then-predict models - Using the extracted rationales/highlights to train separate classifiers and comparing performance to end-to-end models.

So in summary, key terms cover robustness, explainability, faithfulness measurements, explanation-guided training approaches, and in-domain vs out-of-domain evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a method called REGEX to improve the faithfulness of highlight explanations. What are the two main components of REGEX and how do they aim to improve faithfulness?

2. REGEX uses input gradient regularization and virtual adversarial training for robustness improvement. Why might improving model robustness also lead to more faithful explanations? What is the intuition behind this?

3. The explanation guided training (EGT) component masks low-attribution tokens and minimizes the KL divergence between attention distributions. Walk through the details of how EGT works and why it may reduce the effect of noisy tokens.
