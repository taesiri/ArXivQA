# [Cross-Domain Image Captioning with Discriminative Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01662)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- Can finetuning an image captioning model with a self-supervised discriminative objective help it generate more informative and useful captions compared to just training on human reference captions? 

- The authors hypothesize that finetuning a pretrained captioner to play a discrimination game with an image retriever will help it move away from mimicking potentially uninformative or idiosyncratic human captions. This will allow it to produce plainer, more descriptive captions that are better for practical applications like cross-domain image retrieval.

- They also hypothesize that the discriminatively finetuned captions will not only be good for retrieval by neural systems, but could also be more useful for human image discrimination compared to human-written or non-finetuned captions.

So in summary, the main goals are to explore whether discriminative finetuning can improve caption informativeness and usefulness compared to just training on human references, and testing this both via neural retrieval and human evaluation. The key hypothesis is that the discriminative objective will undo abstraction learned from human captions and recover more plainly descriptive language.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for finetuning neural image captioners to generate more discriminative and communicative captions. The key ideas are:

- Taking a pretrained image captioning model and finetuning it with a self-supervised discriminative objective using reinforcement learning. Specifically, the model plays a "discrimination game" with an image retriever, trying to generate captions that allow the retriever to identify the target image among distractors.

- Showing that this discriminative finetuning improves the generalizability and communicative ability of the captions, even without using any human annotations during finetuning. The new captions enable better cross-domain image retrieval and are more useful for humans trying to identify images compared to the original model. 

- Analyzing the changes in the caption language and style induced by the discriminative finetuning. It steers the model away from overfitting the idiosyncrasies of the original caption dataset and towards a more plainly descriptive style.

- Demonstrating the benefits on two popular captioners - ClipCap and BLIP. The method is captioner-agnostic and only needs unannotated images.

Overall, the discriminative finetuning approach provides a simple but effective way to improve caption generalizability and communication abilities without extra human annotation. The analysis offers insights into how the finetuning changes caption language and style.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a simple method to fine-tune image captioning models using a self-supervised discriminative objective, where the captioner plays an image discrimination game with a frozen image retriever, leading to improved generalization and more descriptive captions compared to non-fine-tuned models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new method for improving image captioning models by finetuning them with a self-supervised discriminative objective. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- Most prior work on image captioning focuses on training models to maximize similarity to human-generated reference captions, either via cross-entropy loss or rewards based on NLG metrics. This paper explores an alternative objective that does not rely on human references.

- A few prior papers have explored discriminative or retrieval-based training objectives for image captioning, but this work proposes a particularly simple and effective approach using an off-the-shelf image retriever. The method is model-agnostic and only needs unlabeled images.

- The paper shows strong improvements in generalization to out-of-domain datasets after discriminative finetuning. This demonstrates the method's ability to improve caption quality in a zero-shot cross-domain setup, which has been an open challenge. 

- The analysis shows finetuning can recover more descriptive and visually-grounded language compared to models that overfit to a particular captioning style. This is a novel finding.

- Using human evaluations, the paper demonstrates the finetuned captions can be more useful than human references for identifying images, which questions the assumption that human captions are always the best target.

In summary, this paper makes several notable contributions compared to prior work by introducing a simple and effective discriminative finetuning approach for image captioning, and providing extensive analysis of its impacts on generalization, language quality, and human usefulness. The results open interesting future work on balancing human-mimicry with more goal-oriented objectives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future work based on their discriminative finetuning method:

- Study the effect of using images from different datasets for discriminative finetuning.

- Alternate different retrievers during finetuning to help the model generalize beyond the quirks of a specific retriever. 

- Explore more sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques beyond basic REINFORCE.

- Study the interplay between human feedback and neural feedback for improving captioning systems.

- Do a thorough investigation on how the nature of the captions used to pre-train the backbone captioner affects the proposed method.

- Apply the method to scenarios requiring very fine-grained image discrimination like video understanding.

- Further analyze the impact of different types and numbers of distractors during training on generalization.

So in summary, they suggest exploring variations in the finetuning data and method, integrating human feedback, analyzing the effect of the pre-training data, and applying the method to challenging discrimination tasks like video understanding. The key theme is further improving and analyzing discriminative finetuning to make image captions more useful for real applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method to fine-tune neural image captioning models to generate more discriminative captions that are better at distinguishing a target image from distractor images. The authors take a pre-trained captioning model like ClipCap or BLIP and fine-tune it using a self-supervised discriminative objective, where the model must generate a caption that allows a frozen image retrieval model (CLIP) to distinguish the target image from a set of distractor images. The captioning model is optimized using reinforcement learning, with the reward based on the retrieval model's ability to select the target image given the generated caption. Experiments show that captions fine-tuned this way enable better cross-domain image retrieval, both for the neural retriever and human annotators, compared to the original captioning model, at the cost of slightly lower faithfulness to human captions on in-domain data. Qualitative analysis reveals the fine-tuned captions use more plainly descriptive language focused on visual aspects rather than mimicking the sometimes vague or abstract style of human captions. Overall, the discriminative fine-tuning produces captions that are more useful for distinguishing images while generalizing better across domains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to finetune neural image captioning models to generate more discriminative and descriptive captions. The authors take a pre-trained captioning model like ClipCap or BLIP and finetune it using a self-supervised reinforcement learning approach. The captioner is rewarded for generating captions that allow a frozen image retriever model like CLIP to identify the target image from a set of distractor images. This discrimination game helps the captioner move away from mimicking potentially noisy or uninformative human captions, and instead produce more useful plain descriptions of image content. 

The authors show that their discriminative finetuning method improves caption quality for out-of-domain datasets, even without access to any target domain language data. For example, a COCO-trained captioner finetuned this way generalizes better to Flickr and other datasets than the original model. They also find that for noisy captions like Conceptual Captions, their method often produces descriptions more useful for retrieval than the original human captions. Qualitative analysis confirms that discriminative finetuning recovers more descriptive language compared to human and baseline model captions. The method provides a way to improve generalization of captioning models without additional annotations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to finetune pretrained image captioning models to generate more discriminative captions. The key idea is to finetune the text generation module of a captioner using a self-supervised discriminative objective, without requiring any additional annotated data. Specifically, the captioner is trained to generate a description of a target image that enables a frozen pretrained image retriever to identify the target image from a set of candidates. The captioner generates a caption for the target image which is fed to the retriever. The retriever uses this caption to select the target image from among the candidates, based on a similarity score between the caption embedding and image embeddings. The captioner is optimized using reinforcement learning, with the reward based on whether the retriever successfully selects the target image. This pushes the captioner to generate more discriminative captions better suited for the retrieval task. The method is applied to ClipCap and BLIP captioners and shown to improve retrieval accuracy both in-domain and out-of-domain.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem that neural image captioning models trained on human references often generate vague or inaccurate captions that do not effectively communicate the content of an image. 

- Standard training objectives like cross-entropy loss or optimizing natural language generation metrics against references encourage mimicking human captions, but don't ensure the captions will be useful for downstream tasks.

- The authors propose a method called "discriminative finetuning" to adapt a pretrained neural captioner to generate more informative and discriminative captions by playing an image discrimination game against a frozen image retriever.

- The finetuned captioner must generate a caption so that the retriever can pick out the target image from a set of candidates, providing a self-supervised discriminative training signal.

- Experiments show this leads to better cross-domain generalization and more plainly descriptive captions compared to the original captioner, even outperforming human captions on an image discrimination task.

- The finetuning approach is model-agnostic and only requires unlabeled images, making it widely applicable for improving caption informativeness and discrimination abilities.

In summary, the key question is how to improve neural captioners to generate more useful and descriptive captions, which the authors address through a simple discriminative finetuning method using self-supervised learning. The main goal is making the captions more informative for downstream discrimination tasks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised method called DiscriTune to finetune image captioning models to generate more discriminative and informative captions. The authors take a pre-trained captioner and finetune its text generation component using reinforcement learning, with the reward provided by an image retriever's ability to correctly retrieve the target image from distractor images based on the generated caption. Experiments show that captions from the finetuned models are slightly less similar to human references on in-domain data, but achieve better cross-domain generalization and are more useful for humans performing an image discrimination task. Analysis reveals the finetuned captions have more precise visual language compared to human references, which tend to contain more abstract terms. The method is model-agnostic, shown to work for both ClipCap and BLIP captioners, only requires unlabeled images during finetuning, and outperforms prior work using discrimination for caption learning. The key novelty is using neural discriminative feedback to guide finetuning without extra human annotation. Overall, this work demonstrates how purely self-supervised tuning can improve caption informativeness and specificity.
