## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest several promising research directions and trends for future work on dialogue systems:1. Multimodal dialogue systems - Building chatbots that can integrate information from different modalities like vision, speech, etc. This is an emerging area of research.2. Multitask dialogue systems - Developing systems that can act as both task-oriented assistants and open-domain chatbots simultaneously in a single framework/model. 3. Corpus exploration on the internet - Enabling dialogue agents to explore and utilize online conversational data/corpora in real-time for training. This requires standardizing access and legal terms.4. User modeling - Improving user simulation modules that can provide realistic user interactions for training and evaluating dialogue systems. Better user models can enable more coherent dialogues.5. Dialogue generation with long-term goals - Designing open-domain chatbots capable of guiding conversations towards specific long-term goals, similar to how humans converse. This can be achieved via reinforcement learning.In summary, the key suggested trends are leveraging multi-modality, building blended dialogue systems, utilizing internet data, enhancing user simulation, and long-term conversational planning. The authors highlight these promising directions based on the capabilities shown in recent research.
