# Recent Advances in Deep Learning Based Dialogue Systems: A Systematic   Survey

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the recent advances and trends in deep learning-based dialogue systems, including both task-oriented and open-domain systems?The authors aim to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and frameworks used in modern dialogue systems research. The paper discusses the key deep learning models, the principles and techniques behind task-oriented and open-domain systems, major research challenges, evaluation methods, datasets, and future research directions. Specifically, the paper reviews various neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs, attention mechanisms, memory networks etc. and their applications in dialogue systems. It also covers end-to-end vs modular approaches for task-oriented systems, and generative vs retrieval-based methods for open-domain chatbots. Several sections are dedicated to hot topics like knowledge grounding, empathy, persona modeling, visualization, and controllable generation in dialogue research.So in summary, the central goal is to provide a systematic and up-to-date survey of deep learning based dialogue systems, summarizing the key ideas, models, challenges, and trends in this research field. The comprehensive literature review and multi-angle analysis make this a valuable reference for anyone looking to get an overview of state-of-the-art techniques and promising directions in building advanced conversational AI systems.
