## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest several promising research directions and trends for future work on dialogue systems:

1. Multimodal dialogue systems - Building chatbots that can integrate information from different modalities like vision, speech, etc. This is an emerging area of research.

2. Multitask dialogue systems - Developing systems that can act as both task-oriented assistants and open-domain chatbots simultaneously in a single framework/model. 

3. Corpus exploration on the internet - Enabling dialogue agents to explore and utilize online conversational data/corpora in real-time for training. This requires standardizing access and legal terms.

4. User modeling - Improving user simulation modules that can provide realistic user interactions for training and evaluating dialogue systems. Better user models can enable more coherent dialogues.

5. Dialogue generation with long-term goals - Designing open-domain chatbots capable of guiding conversations towards specific long-term goals, similar to how humans converse. This can be achieved via reinforcement learning.

In summary, the key suggested trends are leveraging multi-modality, building blended dialogue systems, utilizing internet data, enhancing user simulation, and long-term conversational planning. The authors highlight these promising directions based on the capabilities shown in recent research.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a deep learning framework for dialogue state tracking in task-oriented dialogue systems. The key component is a novel slot gating module based on a copy mechanism. Specifically, the framework consists of an utterance encoder, a slot gate decoder, and a state generator. The utterance encoder uses a BiLSTM to encode the user utterance. The slot gate decoder predicts which slots need to be updated for the current turn based on the encoder features. It makes a binary decision for each slot using a softmax classifier. The state generator then focuses only on the slots predicted as needing an update by the gate decoder. It copies relevant slot values from the dialogue context using a pointer network. The pointer network attends over the encoder features to copy slot values. This selective overwrite approach allows efficient and accurate tracking of dialogue states. The entire framework is trained end-to-end using supervised learning on labeled dialogue states. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results for dialogue state tracking.
