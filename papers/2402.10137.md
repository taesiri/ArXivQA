# [TOAD: Task-Oriented Automatic Dialogs with Diverse Response Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10137)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "TOAD: Task-Oriented Automatic Dialogs with Diverse Response Styles":

Problem:
- Creating high-quality annotated data for task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems is expensive and time-consuming. 
- Existing TOD datasets lack consideration for adaptive response styles and realistic interactions with app contexts like calendars.
- There is a need for TOD systems that can adapt their response styles (e.g. verbosity level, expression mirroring) to different usage scenarios to enhance naturalness and user experience.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce TOAD, a novel and scalable TOD dataset with an automatic generation pipeline that:
  - Simulates realistic app context interactions like revising calendar events
  - Provides diverse system response styles - low, mid and high verbosity levels; with/without user expression mirroring
- The data generation pipeline has 3 key stages:
  1. Persona-grounded user context generation 
  2. Action plot generation
  3. Dialog utterance realization by large language models
- TOAD currently covers 11 service domains with over 37K dialog turns. As an automatic pipeline, it is highly scalable.

Main Contributions:
- A new TOD dataset investigating adaptive response styles for more natural conversations
- Realistic simulations of app context interactions
- A cost-effective and scalable automatic pipeline for TOD data generation
- Analysis of the dimensions of response style that influence naturalness
- Benchmark scores for TOD response generation tasks to facilitate future research

In summary, TOAD explores adaptive response styles for more natural task-oriented conversations, provides an automatic data generation pipeline, and benchmarks for future research towards the next generation of intelligent virtual assistants.
