# [DetDiffusion: Synergizing Generative and Perceptive Models for Enhanced   Data Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current perceptive models like object detectors rely heavily on large-scale datasets which are resource intensive to acquire. On the other hand, recent advances in generative models like diffusion models allow high-quality image synthesis from annotations. However, prior works have mostly focused on improving either the generative or perceptive models separately. There is an opportunity to synergize them for mutual enhancement.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DetDiffusion, a novel perception-aware generation framework to explore the synergy between generative and perceptive models. It incorporates two key components:

1) Perception-Aware Loss (P.A. Loss): Uses an additional segmentation head to provide supervision over intermediate generative model features. This improves image quality and layout control. 

2) Perception-Aware Attribute (P.A. Attr): Extracts easy/hard detection attributes for each object from a pre-trained detector. Using these as conditional inputs customizes the generated data to be more tailored for training the detector.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework designed to synergize generative and perceptive models through P.A. Loss and P.A. Attr.

2) P.A. Loss improves generation quality and controllability by leveraging segmentation supervision.  

3) P.A. Attr enables generating data targeted to boost detector performance. Experiments show significant gains in COCO object detection.

4) DetDiffusion sets new state-of-the-art in layout-to-image generation quality on COCO, achieving 31.2 mAP. Augmenting detector training with its synthesized images leads to 0.9 mAP gain.

In summary, DetDiffusion explores an underexplored synergy between generation and perception for mutual enhancement. Both its superior quality and effectiveness in improving downstream tasks highlight the promise of this integrated approach.
