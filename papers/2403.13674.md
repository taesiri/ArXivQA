# [Reward-Driven Automated Curriculum Learning for Interaction-Aware   Self-Driving at Unsignalized Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections remains challenging due to the uncertainty associated with surrounding vehicles' (SVs) driving intentions and the varying traffic densities. Existing rule-based and optimization-based methods struggle to account for all possible scenarios and adapt to rapid changes. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from low sample efficiency and may converge to suboptimal policies. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a reward-driven automated curriculum proximal policy optimization (RD-ACPPO) approach to address these challenges. The key ideas are:

1) Decompose the target task into a curriculum set with increasing number of SVs to accommodate progressively higher difficulties. Model curriculum selection as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem.

2) Design an automated curriculum selection module based on exponential-weight algorithm to dynamically allocate importances and sample curricula. This guides the agent to explore more rewarding scenarios.

3) Carefully design the reward function to incentivize efficiency, safety and interaction-aware behaviors. 

4) Integrate the module with PPO to optimize the policy network.

Main Contributions:

1) An interaction-aware RL framework RD-ACPPO that leverages automated curriculum learning to address uncertainties at unsignalized intersections.

2) A MAB based curriculum selection module that rationally allocates importances across curricula over time to enhance sample efficiency. 

3) Superior performance over baselines regarding task success rate, robustness, and adaptivity across varying traffic densities validated in both highway-env and CARLA simulator.
