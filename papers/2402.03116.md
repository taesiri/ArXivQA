# [Feature-Action Design Patterns for Storytelling Visualizations with Time   Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditionally, storytelling visualizations are created for a known, static dataset by authors defining a storyboard. This does not work well for dynamic, multi-stream datasets that are continuously updated, like COVID-19 data during the pandemic. It is also not scalable when many personalized storytelling visualizations are needed for different individuals and contexts. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new meta-authoring method to create generalized storyboards that can work with multiple, dynamic, unseen datasets. The key ideas are:

1) Meta-authoring: Authors create a meta-storyboard by anticipating features that may appear in similar datasets and mapping them to visualization actions. This meta-storyboard can then be applied to unseen, dynamic datasets.

2) Feature-action patterns: Common data features (e.g. peaks, slopes) are detected algorithmically and mapped to visualization actions (e.g. highlight segment, annotate point) to tell data-driven stories.

3) Algorithmic pipeline: An algorithmic pipeline processes time series data to detect features, ranks feature importance, segments timelines, and selects actions to visualize impactful events.

The method is demonstrated through COVID-19 and machine learning storyboards. COVID-19 stories visualize cases in different regions over time, comparing waves and key events. ML stories visualize model benchmarking, tracking metrics like accuracy over runs.

Main Contributions:

- Meta-authoring method to create generalized storyboards for multi-stream dynamic data 

- Concept of feature-action patterns to map detected data features to visualization actions

- Algorithmic pipeline to process time series, detect events, rank importance, segment time, and drive animations

- Demonstrated feasibility through COVID-19 and machine learning storyboarding case studies

The proposed approach enables efficient and automated storytelling for streaming datasets tailored to individual user contexts. It is a novel addition to author-driven and reader-driven storytelling systems.
