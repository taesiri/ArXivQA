# ToolkenGPT: Augmenting Frozen Language Models with Massive Tools via   Tool Embeddings

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is developing an efficient and flexible approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with the ability to leverage massive external tools. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel method called "ToolkenGPT" which represents each tool as a "toolken" embedding that can be predicted by the LLM like a regular token. This allows the LLM to master and call upon a large number of tools without expensive fine-tuning, while still learning from extensive demonstration data.The central hypothesis is that modeling tools as lightweight toolken embeddings enables LLMs to rapidly adapt to new tools on the fly by expanding the toolken vocabulary. This combines the strengths of prior tool integration paradigms like fine-tuning and in-context learning, while avoiding their limitations.The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of ToolkenGPT in enhancing LLMs with relevant tools across diverse domains, including numerical reasoning, knowledge-based QA, and embodied task planning. The goal is to show ToolkenGPT's potential for LLMs to leverage massive tools for complex problem-solving.In summary, the key research focus is efficiently augmenting LLMs with massive tools through lightweight toolken embeddings, with the hypothesis that this method will enable rapid adaptation to new tools and improved performance on tasks requiring relevant tool usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel method called "ToolkenGPT" for efficiently augmenting large language models (LLMs) with massive external tools. Specifically, the key ideas of ToolkenGPT are:- Representing each tool as a "toolken" (tool + token) by learning a lightweight embedding vector for it. This allows tools to be called like regular tokens during text generation.- Toolken embeddings are appended to the LLM head, so tools can be predicted without fine-tuning the entire LLM parameters. This enables efficient adaptation to new tools. - Once a toolken is predicted, the LLM switches to "tool mode" temporarily and generates arguments to execute the tool call.- Toolken embeddings can be trained on extensive tool demonstration data, unlike typical in-context learning approaches.In this way, ToolkenGPT combines the benefits of LLM fine-tuning and in-context learning approaches, while avoiding their limitations. It allows efficient integration of massive tools into frozen LLMs and leveraging large amounts of demonstration data.The paper shows ToolkenGPT can effectively utilize numerous tools in diverse applications like numerical reasoning, knowledge-based QA, and embodied plan generation. It outperforms previous methods significantly in leveraging tools to solve complex problems.In summary, the main contribution is proposing ToolkenGPT as an effective and scalable approach to augment LLMs with massive external tools without expensive fine-tuning. The toolken embedding method is the core novel technique for efficient and flexible tool integration.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research on tool learning for large language models:The key innovation of this paper is representing tools as "toolken" embeddings that can be predicted like regular tokens during text generation. This allows integrating an arbitrary number of tools into an LLM without expensive fine-tuning. It combines the benefits of fine-tuning (using lots of demonstration data) and in-context learning (flexibility for new tools) while avoiding their limitations. In contrast, prior work on tool learning has limitations:- Fine-tuning methods like Toolformer can use extensive training data but are limited to a fixed set of tools and require expensive retraining for new tools.- In-context learning methods like ReAct are flexible to new tools but are limited by context length and cannot leverage large training data. They also rely heavily on prompt engineering.This paper shows toolken embeddings can be effectively learned from both annotated real data and synthetic demonstrations. The toolkens generalize well even when trained only on synthetic one-hop data.The experiments cover diverse tasks spanning numerical reasoning, QA, and embodied agents. In all cases, ToolkenGPT outperforms in-context learning baselines, especially as the number of tools grows large. It also shows compatibility with advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought.Overall, this paper presents an important advancement in efficiently adapting LLMs to leverage massive external tools. The toolken embedding approach enables tapping into the expanding landscape of tools while retaining a frozen LM architecture. The strong empirical results support the flexibility and effectiveness of this method across different domains.
