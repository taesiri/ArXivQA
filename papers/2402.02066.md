# [Trustworthiness of $\mathbb{X}$ Users: A One-Class Classification   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying Twitter users as trusted or untrusted is important to maintain platform reliability. 
- Traditional machine learning models face challenges with high-dimensional imbalanced Twitter data.
- Limited exploration of using One-Class Classification (OCC) models for Twitter user classification.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use various OCC models to classify Twitter users as trusted or untrusted.
- Propose a subspace learning-based approach to optimize OCC performance. 
- Introduce a novel regularization term for Subspace SVDD (SSVDD) that expresses data concentration in lower-dimensional subspace while preserving local data structure.

Dataset:
- 1000 manually labeled Twitter profiles of politicians, categorized as trusted or untrusted.
- Features extracted include tweet metrics, influence score, sentiment, credibility.  

Models Compared:
- Linear and non-linear variants of OCSVM, SVDD, SSVDD, GEOCSVM, GESVDD.
- Proposed variants: SSVDD with new regularization term using kNN, within-cluster and between-cluster graphs.

Results:
- Non-linear OCC models outperform linear counterparts in accuracy and metrics. 
- Proposed non-linear SSVDD variant with kNN graph shows best performance.
- regularization captures local structure and improves optimization.

Main Contributions:
- First use of subspace learning-based OCC for Twitter user classification
- Novel regularizer for SSVDD expressing data concentration in lower subspace while preserving local structure
- Evaluated new variants on 1000 labeled profiles, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques

In summary, the paper demonstrates the potential of OCC models for reliable Twitter user classification through a subspace learning approach and graph-based regularization. The proposed SSVDD variant shows superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
