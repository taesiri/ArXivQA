# [Models under which random forests perform badly; consequences for   applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.0943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we learn reusable skill embeddings from unlabeled video demonstrations that can be composed to solve new tasks?

In particular, the authors aim to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view video demonstrations, without needing any correspondence between frames and task labels. The goal is for the learned embedding to enable training reinforcement learning agents to reuse previous skills for new tasks by using the embedding space as a reward function.

To address this, the paper introduces Adversarial Skill Networks, which combines a metric learning loss that utilizes temporal video coherence with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill transfer loss. The key ideas are:

- The metric learning loss learns a state representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. 

- The adversarial skill transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains by maximizing the entropy of a discriminator's outputs.

- Using these losses jointly results in a versatile embedding space that represents skills in a task-independent way.

- The learned embedding can then be used as a reward function to train RL agents to solve new tasks by composing and interpolating previously seen skills.

So in summary, the central research question is how to learn a reusable, task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled videos that allows solving new tasks by skill composition, which they address using an adversarial learning framework with specific metric and entropy losses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Adversarial Skill Networks (ASN), a novel approach for learning a transferable skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view videos. The method combines a metric learning loss that utilizes temporal video coherence with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill-transfer loss. The metric learning component attracts simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation and repels temporally close but visually different frames to learn a disentangled state representation. The adversarial component trains an encoder network against a discriminator network in a minimax game. The encoder tries to maximize the entropy of the discriminator output to encourage versatility and generalizability of the learned embedding, while the discriminator tries to minimize the entropy to improve its skill recognition ability. This results in a skill embedding space that is versatile, can represent multiple skills, and is task-independent. 

The authors evaluate ASN on simulated and real-world block manipulation tasks. Quantitative results show it outperforms prior methods like Time-Contrastive Networks on zero-shot temporal alignment of multi-view videos. Further experiments demonstrate ASN can be used to learn reusable control policies for novel compositions of previously seen skills given only a single video demonstration. The method does not need correspondence between frames and task IDs nor instrumentation. This allows end-to-end learning directly from pixels with minimal human involvement. The paper demonstrates promising results towards reusable, task-agnostic skill learning from unlabeled video.
