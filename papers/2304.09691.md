# [DarSwin: Distortion Aware Radial Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09691)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we design a transformer-based model that can automatically adapt to the distortion produced by different wide-angle lenses?

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a novel transformer encoder architecture called DarSwin that embeds knowledge of the lens distortion profile into its structure. This allows it to adapt to different distortion profiles.

- Introducing distortion-aware components into DarSwin:
  - Polar patch partitioning 
  - Distortion-based sampling for token embeddings
  - Angular relative positional encoding for patch merging

- Showing through classification experiments on distorted ImageNet that DarSwin can perform zero-shot generalization to different lens distortion profiles much better than baseline methods like Swin and deformable attention transformers.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by designing a distortion-aware transformer model like DarSwin, we can enable better generalization and adaptation to different lens distortion profiles in a zero-shot manner. The paper aims to demonstrate this via extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new transformer-based architecture called DarSwin that can automatically adapt to the distortion profile of a camera lens. The key ideas are:

- Using a polar patch partitioning strategy rather than the cartesian strategy typically used in vision transformers like Swin. This allows the image patches to better match the radial distortion of wide-angle lenses.

- Employing a distortion-aware sampling technique to create token embeddings from the polar patches. This helps embed knowledge of the lens distortion into the model architecture.

- Using an angular relative positional encoding scheme to capture relationships between the polar patch tokens. 

- Introducing distortion-aware polar patch merging operations in the hierarchical architecture.

Through experiments on distorted ImageNet images, the authors demonstrate that DarSwin can perform zero-shot generalization to new lens distortion profiles not seen during training. Compared to baselines like Swin and deformable attention transformers, DarSwin achieves superior performance when evaluating on out-of-distribution distortions.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing a novel transformer architecture that can implicitly adapt to lens distortion profiles, enabling better generalization across different wide-angle lenses compared to prior approaches. The polar coordinate-based design choices allow embedding distortion knowledge into the model itself.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it relates and compares to other research in the field:

- The paper presents a novel transformer-based architecture called DarSwin that is designed to automatically adapt to the distortion profile of wide-angle lenses. This sets it apart from previous transformer architectures like Swin and ViT that use a cartesian grid partitioning and do not account for lens distortion.

- It is most directly related to other works aiming to enable deep networks to handle wide-angle/fisheye images without undistorting them first, such as deformable CNNs and spherical CNNs. However, DarSwin is the first transformer-based approach shown to adapt to lens distortion.

- Compared to deformable CNN methods, DarSwin does not require expensive per-sample kernel deformation and can handle a wide field of view. Spherical CNNs adapt to spherical distortion but have not been shown to generalize to other wide-angle lenses.

- DarSwin relies on a distortion-aware polar partitioning of the image, angular positional encoding, and distortion-based sampling. These components allow it to embed knowledge of the lens geometry into the architecture itself.

- Experiments demonstrate DarSwin's superior generalization ability compared to baselines when training on one lens distortion profile and testing on others. This indicates it is better able to handle the "distortion gap" problem.

- Limitations include the need for a calibrated lens, sparse sampling, and restriction to classification tasks so far. But the results indicate promise for future extensions to uncalibrated settings and dense prediction tasks.

In summary, DarSwin introduces a novel transformer architecture that sets a new state-of-the-art for adapting to wide-angle lens distortion in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating advantages over prior CNN and transformer approaches. There is significant potential for future work building on these ideas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions based on the limitations and findings of their work:

- Improving the distortion aware sampling strategy. While it was effective for zero-shot adaptation, the sparsity of sampling points and need to interpolate pixel values may affect performance. Other sampling strategies could be explored.

- Extending the approach to uncalibrated lenses. Currently the method assumes the distortion profile is known through lens calibration. Inspiration could be taken from other works to estimate the distortion profile of uncalibrated lenses. 

- Applying the approach to per-pixel tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. The authors hope to make the pixel decoders in such models distortion aware as well.

- Developing insights from this encoder architecture towards designing distortion aware models for uncalibrated lenses and dense pixel-level tasks.

- Expanding evaluation to additional tasks beyond classification, such as semantic segmentation.

In summary, the main future directions are: improving the sampling strategy, removing the calibration requirement, applying it to dense prediction tasks, and evaluating on more computer vision problems beyond classification. The authors aim to build on the strong performance of their distortion-aware transformer encoder.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents DarSwin, a distortion aware radial Swin transformer for image classification on wide-angle lens images. The key ideas are:

- Leveraging known lens distortion profile to adapt the Swin transformer architecture via polar patch partitioning, distortion-based sampling for token embeddings, and angular positional encoding. This makes the model distortion aware.

- Experiments on ImageNet classification with synthetic distortion show DarSwin can generalize to unseen distortion levels better than Swin, deformable attention transformer, and Swin on undistorted images. 

- Design choices like azimuthal merging, jittering augmentation, and distortion aware sampling contribute to DarSwin's strong performance.

The main conclusion is that explicitly building in distortion awareness through radial transforms enables zero-shot generalization, outperforming generic Cartesian architectures like Swin and deformable attention transformers. This demonstrates the importance of adapting model structure to lens geometry.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents DarSwin, a novel transformer-based model that adapts to the distortion produced by wide-angle lenses. Wide-angle lenses are becoming increasingly popular due to their large field of view, but they introduce significant distortions that break the translation equivariance assumption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DarSwin is inspired by the Swin transformer architecture and embeds knowledge of the lens distortion profile to perform well on distorted images. 

Specifically, DarSwin employs a distortion aware polar patch partitioning strategy to split the image into patches. It uses a distortion-based sampling technique to obtain embeddings for each patch. Self-attention is computed using angular relative positional encodings to capture relationships between the radial patches. DarSwin is evaluated on distorted ImageNet classification and demonstrates an ability to generalize to unseen distortions at test time. It outperforms baselines like Swin applied on distorted images and achieves comparable performance to Swin applied on undistorted images, without having access to the undistorted images at training or test time. In summary, DarSwin introduces a novel distortion-aware transformer that achieves robustness to different lens distortion profiles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a novel transformer-based model called DarSwin that is distortion aware and can automatically adapt to the distortion produced by wide-angle lenses. The key aspects of DarSwin are:

- It uses a polar patch partitioning strategy to divide the image into patches based on radius and azimuth angles rather than cartesian coordinates. The radial partitioning takes into account the lens distortion curve to make equiangular divisions. 

- It employs a distortion aware sampling technique to sample points from each patch before creating token embeddings. The sampling uses the lens distortion curve to sample equiangularly along radius.

- It performs window-based self-attention on the token embeddings. The windows can be formed along azimuth or both azimuth and radius. 

- It uses an angular relative positional encoding scheme to capture relationships between tokens based on their incident angle and azimuth.

- It performs polar patch merging, again either along azimuth or azimuth+radius.

By embedding the lens distortion curve into the various components of the architecture, DarSwin is able to adapt to different levels of distortion and generalize to unseen distortions better than other transformer baselines. The model is evaluated on classification tasks using synthetically distorted ImageNet data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper addresses the problem of adapting vision systems to handle the distortion caused by wide-angle lenses. Wide-angle lenses introduce significant radial distortion, which breaks the translation equivariance assumptions in convolutional neural networks.

- The paper proposes a new transformer-based model called DarSwin that adapts to the known lens distortion profile. DarSwin uses polar patch partitioning, distortion-based sampling for token embeddings, angular positional encodings, and polar patch merging strategies. 

- The goal is to allow the model to generalize to different lens distortion profiles in a zero-shot manner without needing to retrain or finetune on each new lens. This aims to bridge the "distortion gap" between training and test lenses.

- Experiments on distorted ImageNet classification show DarSwin can generalize to unseen distortions better than baselines like Swin, deformable attention networks, and Swin on undistorted images.

In summary, the key focus is designing a vision transformer architecture that can intrinsically adapt to radial lens distortion in order to improve generalization across different wide-angle lenses. The distortion profile is assumed to be known through camera calibration.
