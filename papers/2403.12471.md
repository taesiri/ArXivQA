## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Soft robots have benefits like lightweight and cost-effectiveness but determining optimal design parameters and control strategies is challenging. 
- Existing works focus on bio-inspiration and function realization but lack optimization for efficiency. 
- Providing an efficient and generalizable method for soft robot design and control is difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- Uses an origami-based robot with octagon body for crawling and twisted tower arms for swimming as an example.
- Builds mathematical models to reveal influence of design parameters on locomotion and optimize efficiency. 
- For crawling - devises dynamic model to show impact of friction coefficients on displacements. 
- For swimming - establishes kinematics model and develops algorithm to systematically plan human-like gaits.

Key Contributions:
- Constructs theoretical modeling of geometric configurations and periodic dynamics. 
- Integrates models with design parameters and motion variables to quantify crawling efficiency.
- Develops generalizable heuristic-based algorithm to optimize swimming gaits for max thrust.
- Verifies improved locomotion capabilities through simulations and experiments.

In summary, the paper presents modeling and optimization strategies for an origami robot to enhance multiple locomotion modes. It reveals relationships between design and performance, and develops a bio-inspired, generalizable approach to improve efficiency of soft robots in crawling and swimming. Effectiveness is shown analytically and experimentally.
