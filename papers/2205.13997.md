# [Prototype Based Classification from Hierarchy to Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13997)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is how to design a neural network architecture that can learn different types of concept relationships, ranging from independence to hierarchy, within a single model. 

The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called the Concept Subspace Network (CSN) that is capable of learning a spectrum of multi-concept relationships by using sets of prototypes to define concept subspaces in the latent representation. The key idea is that the alignment between concept subspaces can be controlled during training to guide the desired relationships between concepts, such as independence for fair classification or hierarchy for hierarchical classification.

Specifically, the paper aims to show:

- CSNs can match state-of-the-art performance in specialized tasks like fair classification and hierarchical classification, despite prior techniques being designed for only one problem.

- CSNs allow encoding both independence and hierarchy within a single model by controlling concept subspace alignment.

- CSNs provide a unified framework to learn different concept relationships, reconciling specialized techniques that had previously addressed problems like fairness and hierarchy separately.

- The prototype-based CSN architecture also enables interpretability.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed CSN architecture with controllable concept subspace alignment provides a unified framework for learning a spectrum of multi-concept relationships within a neural network model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a new neural network architecture called the Concept Subspace Network (CSN). The key ideas behind CSNs seem to be:

- Using sets of trainable prototype vectors to define "concept subspaces" in the latent space of the neural network. Each set of prototypes corresponds to a different classification concept (e.g. predicting gender vs predicting creditworthiness).

- Projecting encodings into each concept subspace to perform the associated classification task. Distances to the prototypes in that subspace induce a softmax distribution over classes.

- Introducing a "concept subspace alignment" metric to characterize the relationship between different concept subspaces, ranging from orthogonal (independent concepts) to parallel (hierarchical concepts). 

- Adding alignment loss terms to the training objective to guide the network to learn desired concept relationships like fairness (orthogonal subspaces) or hierarchy (parallel subspaces).

- Unifying specialized model architectures that had previously only been designed for hierarchical classification, fair classification, etc. into a single framework that can represent a spectrum of concept relationships.

The key results seem to be:

- CSNs match state-of-the-art performance on fair classification benchmarks while also being applicable to other tasks like hierarchical classification.

- CSNs outperform prior methods on hierarchical image classification tasks on CIFAR-100 in terms of accuracy and cost of errors.

- A single CSN can enforce both hierarchical and fair classification on a human motion prediction task by using aligned and orthogonal subspaces.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing the CSN architecture to represent and control relationships between classification concepts, unifying previously disparate specialized models. The results demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of fairness and hierarchy tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called a concept subspace network that unifies specialized models for fair classification, hierarchical classification, and other multi-concept learning tasks by using sets of prototypes to define subspaces in the latent representation that can be aligned to encode different concept relationships.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new neural network architecture called the concept subspace network (CSN) for multi-concept learning and classification. The key contributions are:

- CSNs use prototype-based representations for interpretability, similar to prior work like prototype networks (PCNs) and hierarchical prototype networks (HPNs). However, CSNs modify the standard PCN architecture to remove the linear classification layer while maintaining performance.

- CSNs introduce the idea of concept subspaces defined by sets of prototypes. Multiple concept subspaces can be learned jointly, allowing CSNs to perform multiple classification tasks simultaneously. 

- CSNs can learn different concept relationships like independence or hierarchy by controlling the alignment between concept subspaces via the training loss. This enables CSNs to handle both fair classification and hierarchical classification within a single unified framework.

- Experiments show CSNs match state-of-the-art performance on fair classification benchmarks. For hierarchical classification, CSNs exceed prior prototype-based methods like HPNs and metric-guided prototype learning in accuracy and cost of errors on CIFAR-100.

- CSNs can enforce both fairness and hierarchy constraints simultaneously, which is demonstrated on a human motion prediction task. This showcases the flexibility of learning multiple customizable concept relationships.

Overall, the key novelty is the concept subspace framework that generalizes specialized models for fair classification, hierarchical classification, etc. into a single technique. This allows controlling the relationships between learned concepts within a neural network in ways not possible with standard or prior prototype architectures. The results demonstrate the benefits of this approach on a variety of multi-concept learning problems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest a few future research directions:

- Extending the concept of subspace alignment to non-Euclidean geometries like hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic spaces have been used for hierarchical modeling, so this could allow modeling hierarchy in a geometrically natural way within the CSN framework.

- Relaxing simplifying assumptions in the CSN model, such as allowing for more complex relationships beyond subspace cosine similarity, or using adversarial approaches instead of Gaussian distributions for distributional regularization. This could expand the flexibility and applicability of CSNs.

- Applying CSNs to new domains and tasks, especially those involving multi-concept relationships like fairness, hierarchy, or privacy. The authors demonstrated CSNs on a few tasks but suggest they may be useful for many other applications as well.

- Studying emergent concept relationships learned by CSNs on new datasets, and using alignment penalties/rewards to induce desired relationships. This could provide insight into how to guide CSNs for different goals.

- Considering negative societal impacts and unintended consequences of CSNs, such as potential misuse of controllable alignments or problematic effects of using prototypes for human data. Responsible development of the CSN framework is suggested.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: 1) extending CSNs to new geometries and spaces, 2) relaxing simplifying assumptions to improve flexibility, 3) applying CSNs to new tasks and domains, 4) analyzing and controlling emergent concept relationships, and 5) responsible CSN development considering potential downsides.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the challenge of designing neural network architectures that can learn different types of relationships between concepts or attributes. Specifically, it proposes a new model called the Concept Subspace Network (CSN) that is able to learn a spectrum of concept relationships ranging from independence (for fair classification) to hierarchy (for hierarchical classification).

The key ideas presented in the paper are:

- CSNs use prototype-based representations, where sets of trainable prototype vectors define "concept subspaces" in the latent space. Classifications are made by projecting data into these concept subspaces and calculating distances to the prototypes.

- CSNs support multiple concept subspaces and classification tasks by using multiple sets of prototypes. The relationships between concepts are controlled by a measure of "concept subspace alignment".

- Orthogonal concept subspaces support fair/independent classification, where changing belief about one concept does not affect others. Parallel/aligned subspaces support hierarchical classification.

- A single CSN model is able to learn different types of concept relationships ranging from fully independent to hierarchical by controlling the concept subspace alignment during training.

- Experiments show CSNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on fair classification tasks, hierarchical classification tasks, and even a combined task requiring both fair and hierarchical classification in a single model.

In summary, the key contribution is a flexible neural network architecture that unifies specialized models for fair classification, hierarchical classification, and other concept relationships into one framework via the use of trainable concept subspaces. The aim is to provide more control over what neural networks learn.
