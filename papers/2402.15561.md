# [Fair Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines for Ensuring Equity and   Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predictive models are often proprietary, inaccessible, opaque, and can introduce or exacerbate bias and inequity. 
- There is a need for transparent, interpretable, and fair predictive models that can be easily adopted and adapted by different stakeholders.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a fair multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model that incorporates fairness measures into the learning process. 
- MARS is a non-parametric regression model that performs feature selection, handles non-linear relationships, generates interpretable decision rules, and derives optimal splitting criteria.

Key Contributions:
- Integrate fairness into the knot optimization algorithm of MARS during the forward and backward passes by adding fairness constraints to the objective function. This results in fair knot placement.
- Incorporate fairness into the loss function minimization for estimating coefficients after basis function selection. This enforces fairness in coefficient estimation. 
- Provide theoretical justification and empirical validation that the modifications result in a fair MARS model in terms of accuracy and equity.
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fairMARS method compared to baselines on real-world datasets. The method balances accuracy and equity.
- The approach contributes to the advancement of responsible and ethical predictive analytics for social good by providing a transparent, interpretable, and fair predictive model.

In summary, the key innovation is a fair MARS algorithm that bakes fairness considerations into the core model training process through modified knot selection and coefficient estimation. This results in accurate and equitable predictive modeling that can be trustworthy for high-stakes decision making across different sectors.
