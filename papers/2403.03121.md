# [Angry Men, Sad Women: Large Language Models Reflect Gendered Stereotypes   in Emotion Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT-4 are known to encode societal biases and stereotypes, but there is little research on gender bias specifically in the context of emotion analysis. 
- However, gender and emotions are closely linked in societal discourse (e.g. women seen as more empathetic, men's anger more accepted). 
- So it's important to study whether LLMs exhibit gendered emotion associations that reflect stereotypes rather than factual differences in lived experiences.

Methodology:
- Use persona-based prompting to get LLMs to adopt a gendered persona ("Take the role of a man/woman") 
- Prompt models to attribute emotions to over 7,500 real-life events from the ISEAR dataset 
- Test 5 major LLMs - LLaMA, GPT-4, Mistral 
- Analyze over 200K emotion attributions quantitatively and qualitatively

Key Findings:
- All models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, associating sadness with women and anger with men
- The emotions attributed do NOT correspond to actual emotions reported in ISEAR based on gender
- Qualitative analysis of generated explanations also reveals strong evidence of gender stereotyping

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive study of gender bias in emotion attribution in major LLMs
- Strong quantitative and qualitative evidence that models reflect gender stereotypes rather than lived experiences
- Raises questions about suitability of using biased LLMs for emotion applications
- Calls for more interdisciplinary work to address this issue
