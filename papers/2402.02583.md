# [DiffEditor: Boosting Accuracy and Flexibility on Diffusion-based Image   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion-based methods for fine-grained image editing like DragDiff and DragonDiff lack flexibility to harmonize complex editing operations. For example, they struggle to imagine new content not present in the source image like opening the mouth of a lion. They also lack editing accuracy in some cases and can produce unexpected artifacts. 

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces image prompts instead of just text prompts to provide more detailed descriptions of the editing content, improving quality.

2) Proposes a regional SDE sampling strategy that injects controlled randomness into the editing region to improve flexibility while maintaining consistency in unedited areas.  

3) Incorporates regional score-based gradient guidance and a time travel strategy to further refine and improve editing quality.

Proposed Method (DiffEditor):
1) Uses an image prompt encoder to embed image prompts along with text prompts to guide diffusion.

2) Performs sampling using regional SDE that applies SDE only in the editing region.

3) Computes regional gradient guidance locally constrained to the editing area.

4) Introduces time travel strategy for recurrent guidance and refinement.

5) Integrates these strategies into diffusion sampling pipeline guided by prompt embeddings.

Results:
The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various fine-grained editing tasks like object moving, appearance replacing etc. The method also has lower complexity than prior arts like DragDiff and DragonDiff.

In summary, the key ideas are using image prompts, regional SDE sampling, localized gradient guidance and time travel for accurate and flexible diffusion-based image editing.
