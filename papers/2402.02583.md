# [DiffEditor: Boosting Accuracy and Flexibility on Diffusion-based Image   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion-based methods for fine-grained image editing like DragDiff and DragonDiff lack flexibility to harmonize complex editing operations. For example, they struggle to imagine new content not present in the source image like opening the mouth of a lion. They also lack editing accuracy in some cases and can produce unexpected artifacts. 

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces image prompts instead of just text prompts to provide more detailed descriptions of the editing content, improving quality.

2) Proposes a regional SDE sampling strategy that injects controlled randomness into the editing region to improve flexibility while maintaining consistency in unedited areas.  

3) Incorporates regional score-based gradient guidance and a time travel strategy to further refine and improve editing quality.

Proposed Method (DiffEditor):
1) Uses an image prompt encoder to embed image prompts along with text prompts to guide diffusion.

2) Performs sampling using regional SDE that applies SDE only in the editing region.

3) Computes regional gradient guidance locally constrained to the editing area.

4) Introduces time travel strategy for recurrent guidance and refinement.

5) Integrates these strategies into diffusion sampling pipeline guided by prompt embeddings.

Results:
The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various fine-grained editing tasks like object moving, appearance replacing etc. The method also has lower complexity than prior arts like DragDiff and DragonDiff.

In summary, the key ideas are using image prompts, regional SDE sampling, localized gradient guidance and time travel for accurate and flexible diffusion-based image editing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DiffEditor, a diffusion-based image editing method that introduces image prompts and strategies like regional SDE sampling, regional score-based gradient guidance, and time travel to improve the accuracy, flexibility, and quality of fine-grained image editing tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing image prompts into fine-grained image editing tasks to provide more detailed content description and reduce distortion. This image prompt encoder can be plugged into various editing tasks without task-specific training.

2) Proposing a regional SDE strategy to inject flexibility specifically into the editing region while maintaining content consistency in other areas. This improves editing flexibility compared to purely using ODE. 

3) Incorporating regional score-based gradient guidance and a time travel strategy into the diffusion sampling process to further refine and improve editing quality.

4) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various fine-grained image editing tasks like object moving, resizing, pasting, appearance replacing, and content dragging, with attractive complexity compared to prior diffusion-based methods.

In summary, the main contributions are using image prompts, regional SDE, and enhanced gradient guidance strategies to boost both accuracy and flexibility in diffusion-based fine-grained image editing.
