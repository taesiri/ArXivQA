# [API-BLEND: A Comprehensive Corpora for Training and Benchmarking API   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of diverse and comprehensive datasets for training and benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on tool/API usage tasks such as API detection, slot filling and sequencing. 
- Existing datasets rely heavily on synthetic data generation which leads to overfitting and poor out-of-distribution generalization. 
- There is also a lack of benchmark datasets for systematically evaluating API usage capabilities of LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces API-Blend, a large and diverse corpus for training and benchmarking tool-augmented LLMs.
- It contains 10 datasets - 5 for in-distribution training and testing, and 5 more for out-of-distribution testing.
- The training datasets are created from existing dialog, semantic parsing and digital assistant datasets using language model assisted generation and grammar-based transformations.
- The benchmark datasets are sourced from prior works on tool-augmented LLMs.
- In total, API-Blend contains over 190k instances covering API detection, slot filling and sequencing.

Main Contributions:
- Curation of a large and diverse corpus, API-Blend, for training and benchmarking tool-augmented LLMs.
- Demonstration of improved out-of-distribution generalization for models trained on API-Blend compared to prior state-of-the-art.
- Establishing API-Blend as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating API usage capabilities of LLMs through systematic in-distribution and out-of-distribution testing.
- Analysis of common failure cases and suggestions for future work to address limitations.
