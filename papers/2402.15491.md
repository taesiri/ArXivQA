# [API-BLEND: A Comprehensive Corpora for Training and Benchmarking API   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of diverse and comprehensive datasets for training and benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on tool/API usage tasks such as API detection, slot filling and sequencing. 
- Existing datasets rely heavily on synthetic data generation which leads to overfitting and poor out-of-distribution generalization. 
- There is also a lack of benchmark datasets for systematically evaluating API usage capabilities of LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces API-Blend, a large and diverse corpus for training and benchmarking tool-augmented LLMs.
- It contains 10 datasets - 5 for in-distribution training and testing, and 5 more for out-of-distribution testing.
- The training datasets are created from existing dialog, semantic parsing and digital assistant datasets using language model assisted generation and grammar-based transformations.
- The benchmark datasets are sourced from prior works on tool-augmented LLMs.
- In total, API-Blend contains over 190k instances covering API detection, slot filling and sequencing.

Main Contributions:
- Curation of a large and diverse corpus, API-Blend, for training and benchmarking tool-augmented LLMs.
- Demonstration of improved out-of-distribution generalization for models trained on API-Blend compared to prior state-of-the-art.
- Establishing API-Blend as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating API usage capabilities of LLMs through systematic in-distribution and out-of-distribution testing.
- Analysis of common failure cases and suggestions for future work to address limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces API-Blend, a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating tool-augmented large language models on tasks like API detection, slot filling, and sequencing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of API-Blend, a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- API-Blend consists of 10 datasets - 5 for training LLMs on tool/API usage (SeqATIS, SeqSNIPS, SeqSGD, SeqMultiWOZ, SeqTopV2) and 5 for out-of-distribution testing (ToolLLM, API Bank, ToolBench, SeqToolQA, ToolAlpaca). Together these datasets have over 190k instances.

- The training datasets are created by transforming existing datasets into tool/API formats through language model assisted generation, grammar-based generation, and using existing API datasets. This results in more diversity compared to purely synthetic data.

- Experiments show that models trained on API-Blend generalize better on out-of-distribution datasets compared to other tool-augmented LLMs. This demonstrates the utility of API-Blend for both training and systematic benchmarking of tool usage capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and demonstration of the comprehensive API-Blend corpus for advancing tool/API-augmented LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- API-Blend - The name of the comprehensive corpora introduced in the paper for training and benchmarking API-based language models.

- API detection - One of the key tasks that API-Blend focuses on, which involves identifying the right API to call based on a user query.

- Slot filling - Another key task that API-Blend deals with, which involves extracting the input parameters needed to call an API. 

- Sequencing - The task of determining the right sequence of API calls needed to accomplish a high-level task, which API-Blend also covers.

- Out-of-domain generalization - A key capability that models trained on API-Blend are shown to have, allowing them to generalize to new, unseen APIs. 

- Hybrid data generation - API-Blend uses both human-annotated data as well as LLM-assisted data generation to create a diverse training corpus.

- Digital assistants - One of the domains that the datasets in API-Blend are collected from, in addition to dialog and semantic parsing.

So in summary, the key terms cover the tasks, capabilities, data generation strategy, and domains associated with API-Blend. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
