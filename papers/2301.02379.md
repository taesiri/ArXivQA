# [CodeTalker: Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Discrete Motion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02379)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high-quality 3D facial animations from speech using discrete motion priors. The key hypotheses are:

1. Modeling the facial motion space with discrete motion primitives can reduce the ambiguity and uncertainty in mapping speech to facial motions. 

2. Learning a generic and reusable codebook of facial motion primitives allows capturing realistic and subtle motions.

3. Formulating speech-driven facial animation as a code query task in this discrete proxy space can promote synthesis quality and vividness against cross-modal uncertainty.

4. A temporal autoregressive model over the discrete motion space with speech as input can produce accurate lip sync as well as plausible facial expressions.

The main goal is to develop a speech-driven facial animation model that overcomes limitations of previous approaches, such as over-smoothing and lack of vividness, by utilizing a learned discrete motion prior. The method, called CodeTalker, aims to achieve superior performance in terms of realistic motions, accurate lip sync, and natural facial expressions. The code query formulation and discrete motion space are the key innovations proposed to address the ambiguity in mapping speech to motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for speech-driven 3D facial animation called CodeTalker. The key ideas are:

- Modeling the facial motion space with discrete motion primitives learned by a vector quantized autoencoder (VQ-VAE). This allows representing facial motions with a finite set of codes that encapsulate realistic motion priors. 

- Formulating speech-driven facial animation as a code query task in the learned discrete space. This reduces the uncertainty in mapping speech to facial motions.

- Employing a temporal autoregressive model over the discrete code space to sequentially predict facial motion codes from speech. This ensures accurate lip sync and natural expressions.

Specifically, the facial motion codebook and VQ-VAE are first pre-trained on real 3D facial motion data. Then a transformer-based model takes speech as input and generates motion codes in an autoregressive manner. The predicted codes are used to retrieve and reconstruct realistic 3D facial animations.

Compared to previous regression-based methods, CodeTalker avoids over-smoothed motions and achieves better lip sync and vivid expressions. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. The user study also demonstrates the superior perceptual quality of the synthesized animations.

Overall, the key contribution is the novel formulation of speech-driven 3D facial animation as a discrete code query problem, which notably improves the realism and accuracy of motion synthesis. The proposed CodeTalker achieves new state-of-the-art performance.
