# [CodeTalker: Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Discrete Motion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02379)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high-quality 3D facial animations from speech using discrete motion priors. The key hypotheses are:

1. Modeling the facial motion space with discrete motion primitives can reduce the ambiguity and uncertainty in mapping speech to facial motions. 

2. Learning a generic and reusable codebook of facial motion primitives allows capturing realistic and subtle motions.

3. Formulating speech-driven facial animation as a code query task in this discrete proxy space can promote synthesis quality and vividness against cross-modal uncertainty.

4. A temporal autoregressive model over the discrete motion space with speech as input can produce accurate lip sync as well as plausible facial expressions.

The main goal is to develop a speech-driven facial animation model that overcomes limitations of previous approaches, such as over-smoothing and lack of vividness, by utilizing a learned discrete motion prior. The method, called CodeTalker, aims to achieve superior performance in terms of realistic motions, accurate lip sync, and natural facial expressions. The code query formulation and discrete motion space are the key innovations proposed to address the ambiguity in mapping speech to motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for speech-driven 3D facial animation called CodeTalker. The key ideas are:

- Modeling the facial motion space with discrete motion primitives learned by a vector quantized autoencoder (VQ-VAE). This allows representing facial motions with a finite set of codes that encapsulate realistic motion priors. 

- Formulating speech-driven facial animation as a code query task in the learned discrete space. This reduces the uncertainty in mapping speech to facial motions.

- Employing a temporal autoregressive model over the discrete code space to sequentially predict facial motion codes from speech. This ensures accurate lip sync and natural expressions.

Specifically, the facial motion codebook and VQ-VAE are first pre-trained on real 3D facial motion data. Then a transformer-based model takes speech as input and generates motion codes in an autoregressive manner. The predicted codes are used to retrieve and reconstruct realistic 3D facial animations.

Compared to previous regression-based methods, CodeTalker avoids over-smoothed motions and achieves better lip sync and vivid expressions. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. The user study also demonstrates the superior perceptual quality of the synthesized animations.

Overall, the key contribution is the novel formulation of speech-driven 3D facial animation as a discrete code query problem, which notably improves the realism and accuracy of motion synthesis. The proposed CodeTalker achieves new state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel speech-driven 3D facial animation method called CodeTalker that represents facial motions using learned discrete motion priors and predicts facial animations in an autoregressive manner, achieving higher quality and more realistic results compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents CodeTalker, a method for speech-driven 3D facial animation using a discrete motion prior. Here are some key comparisons to other recent work in this field:

- Previous work like VOCA and FaceFormer formulate speech-driven facial animation as a regression problem, directly mapping from speech to facial motions. This can lead to over-smoothed and averaged motions due to the ambiguity of the mapping. CodeTalker instead casts it as a code query task in a learned discrete space, which reduces uncertainty and promotes more vivid motions.

- MeshTalk also uses a categorical latent space to disentangle audio-correlated and uncorrelated factors. But it doesn't have an explicit codebook and the training is more difficult. CodeTalker shows better performance with its codebook of facial motion primitives. 

- Compared to neural 3DMM-based methods like Learn2Listen which are speaker-specific, CodeTalker learns a generic facial motion codebook that generalizes across speakers. The codebook represents more plentiful motion priors.

- CodeTalker employs a transformer-based temporal autoregressive model for robust lip-sync and natural expressions. The model predicts motion codes conditioned on past motions and speech, enabling contextual modeling.

- Experiments show CodeTalker outperforms VOCA, MeshTalk and FaceFormer on both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. The gains highlight the benefits of the discrete motion prior approach.

In summary, CodeTalker advances state-of-the-art speech-driven facial animation through its novel formulation using a learned discrete motion codebook. This reduces cross-modal uncertainty and enables higher quality and more vivid motions compared to previous regression or categorical latent space based methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring the rationality and effect of using Instance Normalization (IN) in the self-reconstruction learning stage. The authors found empirically that IN helped improve performance but suggest further study is needed.

- Guiding 3D facial animation synthesis using priors learned from large-scale available talking head videos, rather than just the limited paired audio-visual training data currently used.

- Further study on the assumption that facial motions are independent of shapes. The validity of this assumption which underpins their approach may require more investigation. 

- Improving the overall perceptual quality of the synthesized animations to get even closer to ground truth real videos. The authors acknowledge there is still a gap here, mainly due to limited training data.

- Extending the discrete codebook approach to model other aspects of facial motion and expression beyond just speech, such as emotions.

- Exploring other potential cross-modal architectures, losses and training frameworks that could improve on the results achieved in this work.

In summary, the main future directions are around better understanding and improving their proposed method, generalizing the approach to leverage more data, and extending the technique to model more complex facial motions and expressions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes CodeTalker, a method for speech-driven 3D facial animation. It formulates facial animation as a code query task in a finite proxy space of learned discrete motion primitives. First, a vector quantized autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is pre-trained to learn a codebook of motion primitives by self-reconstruction of real facial motions. This codebook allows representing facial motions with combinations of discrete codebook items. Then, a temporal autoregressive model is used to sequentially map speech to facial motion codes, conditioned on past motions and speaking style. The model consists of a speech encoder, cross-modal decoder, and the pre-trained VQ-VAE decoder. Experiments on BIWI and VOCA datasets show CodeTalker generates more accurate and vivid animations than previous state-of-the-art methods. A user study also indicates superiority in perceptual quality. The main advantages are using the discrete facial motion space to reduce cross-modal uncertainty and embed realistic motion priors, and the temporal autoregressive formulation for generating detailed and synchronized motions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes CodeTalker, a novel method for speech-driven 3D facial animation. Existing methods typically formulate the mapping from speech to facial motions as a regression task. However, this suffers from over-smoothing and lack of vividness due to the ambiguity in mapping speech to plausible motions. CodeTalker addresses this by representing facial motions using a discrete codebook learned with a VQ-VAE on real motion capture data. This codebook contains facial motion primitives that allow realistic animation. Given speech as input, CodeTalker uses a temporal autoregressive model to predict a sequence of codes from the discrete codebook, which are then decoded into motion sequences. This promotes robustness against the speech-to-motion uncertainty. Experiments on two datasets BIWI and VOCASET demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate lip synchronization and vivid expressions. Both quantitative metrics and user studies confirm the higher quality compared to competitors like VOCA, MeshTalk and FaceFormer.

In summary, the key ideas are: (1) Learn a discrete codebook containing realistic motion primitives with a VQ-VAE. (2) Map speech to codes in this discrete space using a temporal autoregressive model. (3) Animation by decoding predicted code sequences. (4) More robust against speech-to-motion ambiguity, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Experiments validate effectiveness on datasets and via user studies.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes CodeTalker, a novel method for speech-driven 3D facial animation. The key idea is to formulate facial animation as a code query task in a discrete proxy space. Specifically, the method first learns a codebook of facial motion primitives using a transformer-based vector quantized autoencoder. This codebook serves as a finite discrete prior space that approximates the facial motion space, where each code represents a facial motion primitive. Based on this codebook, the method then trains a temporal autoregressive model to predict a sequence of motion codes from an input speech signal. This is achieved by a cross-modal decoder with a speech encoder and transformer decoder. The predicted codes are used to retrieve items from the codebook, which are then passed through the pretrained decoder to reconstruct facial motions. By mapping speech to the discrete proxy space, the uncertainty of the ill-posed speech-to-motion mapping is reduced. Experiments show this method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in generating vivid and realistic speech-driven facial animations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to synthesize realistic facial animations from speech. Specifically, it focuses on the challenges of generating vivid facial motions and accurate lip synchronization from speech signals.

The key questions addressed in the paper are:

1. How to achieve accurate lip synchronization between the generated facial animations and input speech signals? This is challenging due to the ambiguity in mapping speech to facial motions. 

2. How to generate vivid and expressive facial motions, especially for the upper face region which is only weakly correlated with speech? Existing methods tend to produce over-smoothed and static facial motions due to the regression-to-mean effect.

3. How to reduce the uncertainty and ambiguity in mapping speech to facial motions? The ill-posed nature of this problem leads to multiple plausible facial motion outputs for a given speech input.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel method called CodeTalker that formulates speech-driven facial animation as a code query task in a learned discrete codebook space. The codebook effectively embeds realistic facial motion priors to promote animation vividness and reduce cross-modal uncertainty. The temporal autoregressive model further ensures accurate lip synchronization and natural expressions.
