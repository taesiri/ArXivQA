# [DS-AL: A Dual-Stream Analytic Learning for Exemplar-Free   Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17503)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually update a model by learning new classes over time. CIL under an exemplar-free constraint is challenging as models tend to catastrophically forget past knowledge when learning new classes. Existing exemplar-free CIL methods have inferior performance compared to replay-based techniques. Recently proposed analytic learning (AL) based CIL delivers competitive results but suffers from under-fitting due to relying solely on linear mapping.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Dual-Stream Analytic Learning (DS-AL) approach to solve the exemplar-free CIL problem. DS-AL contains:

1) A main stream that reformulates the CIL problem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task. This allows an equivalence between CIL and joint-learning, eliminating catastrophic forgetting. 

2) A compensation stream with a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module. DAC projects an alternatively activated embedding onto the null space of the main stream to compensate for the limited fitting ability of linear mapping. 

Main Contributions:

1) DS-AL establishes equivalence between incremental and joint learning without storing exemplars, overcoming catastrophic forgetting.

2) The compensation stream and DAC module mitigate the under-fitting limitation of linear mapping in AL-based CIL.

3) Experiments show DS-AL matches or exceeds the performance of existing exemplar-free and replay-based CIL methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-Full across various numbers of phases.

4) A 500-phase ImageNet CIL task shows identical performance to a 5-phase task, demonstrating DS-AL's phase-invariant property.

In summary, DS-AL is an exemplar-free CIL technique that delivers strong performance by combining an analytical solution with a compensation stream to enhance fitting ability. It establishes equivalence to joint-learning and exhibits excellent results across datasets and numbers of phases.
