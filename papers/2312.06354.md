# [PortraitBooth: A Versatile Portrait Model for Fast Identity-preserved   Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06354)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes PortraitBooth, a novel and efficient one-shot text-to-portrait generation framework for fast personalized image generation using a single reference image. It achieves high efficiency by eliminating test-time fine-tuning and optimization. Robust identity preservation is enabled through the Subject Text Embedding Augmentation (STEA) module which enhances subject representation by incorporating face features from a pre-trained face recognition model, and the Dynamic Identity Preservation (DIP) module which employs an identity loss during training. Diverse facial expression editing capabilities are achieved via the Emotion-aware Cross-Attention Control (ECAC) mechanism which focuses attention to relevant face regions. Experiments demonstrate PortraitBoothâ€™s state-of-the-art performance in one-shot personalized portrait generation, with superior identity preservation and expression editing abilities compared to existing methods, while requiring less training resources. The method is highly scalable, supporting both single and multi-subject image generation. Overall, PortraitBooth provides an efficient and high-quality text-to-portrait generation solution with robust identity preservation and controllable facial expression editing.
