## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses both direct AI/ML positioning and AI/ML assisted positioning. What are the key differences between these two approaches and what are some example use cases where one approach would be preferred over the other?

2. The paper introduces the concept of "functionality" to manage the activation and switching of different AI/ML models. What specifically does a "functionality" encapsulate and how does this concept allow coordination between the UE and network side when managing models?

3. Fine-tuning is analyzed as a technique to adapt a pre-trained model to new deployment scenarios. What were the key limitations identified when fine-tuning across different drops or clutter settings? What aspects need further analysis to determine if fine-tuning can overcome these limitations?  

4. Several CIR measurement reporting techniques are proposed such as truncation, identifying strongest paths and segmentation. What are the tradeoffs between these techniques in balancing positioning accuracy and report size/signaling overhead? Which technique seems most promising?

5. The paper discusses spatial consistency and its influence on channel models used for evaluations. What specifically is spatial consistency referring to and why is it an important consideration when generating channel realizations? 

6. What role do the proposed concepts of ACS and IPD play in determining the density and quality of collected training data? How do these metrics differ in the insights they provide?

7. The paper identifies tracking solutions as an area that requires further analysis. What are some ways that information from successive positioning snapshots could be incorporated to potentially improve direct positioning performance?

8. Model monitoring and management is highlighted for both active and inactive models/functionalities. What approaches are suggested to select the best inactive alternative when model switching is required? What factors need to be considered?

9. How can concepts like active learning and semi-supervised learning potentially help minimize the reliance on ground truth labels from PRUs during model training? What are some drawbacks of these approaches?

10. What considerations related to positioning accuracy requirements, signaling overhead, and computational complexity motivate the need for proactive model selection and switching? How could this be realized?
