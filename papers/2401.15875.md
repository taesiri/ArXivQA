# [Combining Satellite and Weather Data for Crop Type Mapping: An Inverse   Modelling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Accurate and timely crop mapping is important for tasks like yield estimation and conservation efforts. 
- Most existing methods rely solely on satellite imagery for crop mapping. However, crop growth is a complex process involving weather, soil, etc. 
- Accounting for the physical drivers like weather can improve crop mapping performance and provide new insights.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an inverse modeling approach called WSTATT that combines satellite imagery and weather data for crop mapping.
- It formulates crop mapping as inferring the crop type (initial condition) from observed satellite data (crop growth proxy) and weather drivers.
- The WSTATT model has separate encoders for satellite and weather data which are combined using attention. The decoder then predicts crop maps.
- This forces the model to learn relationships between weather and crop growth to determine crop types.

Main Contributions:
- WSTATT outperforms satellite-only methods like STATT for both year-end and early prediction crop mapping tasks.
- It can predict accurate crop maps months in advance compared to standard practices.
- Analysis shows weather helps focus attention on discriminative time periods for each crop.
- Results are explained through correlation with crop phenology cycles showing model captures meaningful patterns.
- Overall, the paper shows benefit of inverse modeling with weather for crop mapping and early prediction.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for crop mapping that models it as an inverse problem using both satellite and weather data. This outperforms traditional methods, enables early prediction, and provides new physical insights into crop dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an inverse modeling approach called WSTATT that combines spatio-temporal satellite imagery and weather data in a deep learning model to generate accurate and timely pixel-wise crop type maps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for crop mapping called WSTATT (Weather-based Spatio-Temporal segmentation networks with ATTention). WSTATT is a deep learning model that leverages an inverse modeling approach to combine spatiotemporal satellite imagery and weather data for accurate pixel-wise crop type mapping. The key ideas are:

1) Formulating crop growth as an inverse modeling problem where weather drivers and satellite observations of crop growth are available, but the crop type (initial condition) is unknown. The model learns to infer crop type by capturing relationships between weather and crop growth signals.

2) Developing a neural network architecture with separate encoders for satellite and weather data followed by an attention module and decoder to produce crop segmentation maps. The attention module focuses on the most discriminative time periods for each crop.

3) Demonstrating that including weather data allows the model to significantly outperform satellite-only methods for both year-end and early season prediction of crop maps. It also enables better generalization across years.

4) Providing analysis to show that the weather-based model is able to capture physical crop growth processes like timing of maturity and leaf shedding more effectively compared to satellite-only approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is using an inverse modeling paradigm to effectively combine satellite and weather data in a neural network for superior performance in crop type mapping.
