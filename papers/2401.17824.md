# [A Survey of Pre-trained Language Models for Processing Scientific Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17824)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides the first comprehensive review of Language Models (LMs) dedicated to processing scientific text, referred to as SciLMs. The rapid growth of SciLMs over the past few years has made it challenging to keep pace and gain a complete picture of the progress in this field. 

The paper first defines the scope of the survey, covering SciLMs proposed from 2019 to September 2023 across various scientific domains, languages, architectures and modalities. An evolutionary tree illustrates the landscape of 117 identified SciLMs. Key observations include the prevalence of encoder-based architectures like BERT in 91 models, the dominance of biomedical domain with 85 models, and the trend of proposing larger-scale models.

The background introduces LM architectures, categorizing them into encoder-decoder, encoder-only, decoder-only and other styles. It also summarizes scientific tasks into two groups - scientific text mining and scientific text application. Popular tasks include NER, RE, QA, document classification and summarization. Characteristics distinguishing scientific text from other domains are also analyzed across content, style and source.

Section 3 provides a systematic review of existing SciLMs, categorized by domain. 85 biomedical SciLMs demonstrate a progression from LSTM to Transformer architectures. 13 chemical domain models mostly rely on BERT. 11 cover multiple scientific domains. The rest span CS, climate, math and other nascent domains. 

Section 4 conducts an effectiveness analysis by visualizing performance changes over time and listing models surpassing prior SOTA. Charts across NER, RE, QA and other tasks showcase steady progress. However, limited evaluations on 1-2 datasets raise overfitting concerns. Analyzing BERT variations on fixed architectures reveal consistent gains across years for certain tasks.  

Finally, current challenges are discussed including developing multilingual non-English, specialized non-biomedical, large-scale and multi-modal SciLMs. Recommendations to address evaluation, robustness and transparency issues are also provided to shape more reliable future models.

In summary, this paper provides the first systematic review of the rapidly advancing landscape of SciLMs. By appraising state-of-the-art progress and comparing model effectiveness, it offers valuable insights to guide future research towards more versatile, generalized and trustworthy SciLMs.
