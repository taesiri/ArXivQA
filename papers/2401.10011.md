# [CPCL: Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning for Weakly   Supervised Text-based Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Text-based person re-identification (TPRe-ID) aims to retrieve images of a person using only a textual description, without relying on identity labels during training. This weakly supervised setting is more challenging and practical, but suffers from intra-class differences in both visual features (due to varying viewpoints, backgrounds etc.) and semantic gaps between modalities. Prior methods have focused on instance-level alignment and ignored intrinsic, invariant prototypical features.  

Proposed Solution - Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL):
1) Introduces CLIP encoder-decoder model to weakly supervised TPRe-ID for cross-modal feature extraction and mapping to shared space. 
2) Proposes Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) to capture associations between heterogeneous modalities by maintaining up-to-date prototypes.
3) Hybrid-level Cross-modal Matching with Prototypical Contrastive Matching loss and Instance-level loss.  
4) Outlier Pseudo Label Mining distinguishes unclustered samples by leveraging implicit relationships.

Main Contributions:  
1) Novel cross-modal prototypical contrastive learning framework to mitigate intra-class variations. Mimics human cognitive classification behavior.  
2) PMM with momentum update scheme to dynamically maintain prototypical features of modalities.
3) Outlier mining technique to identify valuable unclustered samples.
4) State-of-the-art results on 3 datasets, significantly outperforming prior weakly supervised methods. First use of CLIP for this task.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective approach for weakly supervised TPRe-ID that establishes cross-modal alignment using prototypes and contrastive loss while mining unclustered samples. The method achieves new SOTA results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning method for weakly supervised text-based person re-identification, which brings instance-level samples closer to their prototypes and aligns cross-modal prototypes to mitigate intra-modal and cross-modal variations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1) It proposes a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method to mitigate the intra-modal feature variations and cross-modal semantic gaps in weakly supervised text-based person re-identification. This learning scheme is inspired by human cognitive behavior.

2) It proposes a Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module and a Hybrid-level Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module to help establish associations between heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person. 

3) It introduces an Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module to identify valuable outlier samples by mining implicit relationships between image-text pairs.

4) It achieves state-of-the-art results on three public benchmark datasets with significant improvements. The method marks the first introduction of the CLIP pre-trained model to weakly supervised text-based person re-identification.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel cross-modal prototypical contrastive learning framework for weakly supervised text-based person re-identification, which leverages prototype-level and instance-level alignment as well as outlier mining.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Weakly supervised text-based person re-identification (TPRe-ID) - The paper focuses on this task of retrieving images of a person using only a textual description, without relying on identity annotations.

- Cross-modal prototypical contrastive learning (CPCL) - The proposed method that introduces prototypes for each modality and brings samples closer to their corresponding prototype while pulling prototypes from the same identity together.

- Intra-class variations - Encompasses intra-modal feature variations within a modality and cross-modal semantic gaps between modalities. CPCL aims to mitigate these.  

- Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) - Proposed module that dynamically maintains and updates prototypical features for each identity.

- Hybrid-level Cross-modal Matching (HCM) - Contains both instance-level and prototype-level contrastive losses to align features.

- Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) - Proposed method to identify and add valuable unclustered samples to training.

- CLIP - Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model that is used as the backbone encoder. First introduced to weakly supervised TPRe-ID here.
