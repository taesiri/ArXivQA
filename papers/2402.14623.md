# [RoboScript: Code Generation for Free-Form Manipulation Tasks across Real   and Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14623)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a gap between high-level semantic understanding of language models (LLMs) and the practical nuances of lower-level control and physical constraints needed for robotic manipulation. Existing benchmarks focus more on language understanding rather than ensuring deployability of generated code on real robots. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents RobotScript, a platform and benchmark for code generation that bridges high-level reasoning and low-level control for robot manipulation. The key aspects are:

1) ROS-based Testing: Enables testing and validation of generated code on real robots using ROS, ensuring syntactic validity and simulation testing. Demonstrated on multiple robot platforms (Franka, UR5) and grippers.

2) Perception-in-Loop: Uses outputs of perception modules like grasp detection and 3D scene modeling as inputs to motion planning, rather than ground truth data. This introduces realism and errors to benchmark capability on practical systems. 

3) Physical Reasoning: Comprehensive testbed that evaluates reasoning on physical spaces, constraints and complex object interactions. Highlights performance differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive integration of LLMs with robotics covering perception, planning, grasp detection and control

- In-depth analysis studying impact of factors like object geometry, perception accuracy and planning on real-world deployment

- Assessment of LLM reasoning abilities on complex physical interactions and constraint satisfaction  

The RobotScript platform and benchmark allows generating directly executable robot control code, deployable on both simulation and real hardware. It advances integration of language models and robotics for autonomous manipulation.
