## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MICRO, a novel model-based offline reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates robustness using a conservative Bellman operator. MICRO trades off performance and robustness by combining the standard and robust Bellman operators. Specifically, it applies the standard Bellman operator to accurate offline data and the robust operator to inaccurate model data. The robust operator enforces conservatism by selecting the minimum Q-value within a state uncertainty set induced by model errors. Compared to prior algorithms like RAMBO and ARMOR which constantly update adversarial models, MICRO chooses the worst-case model only once, significantly reducing computation. Theoretically, MICRO guarantees robust policy improvement. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks, outperforming prior model-free and model-based methods. It also demonstrates superior robustness against various environment perturbations and adversarial attacks. Key advantages are better performance and robustness with lower computation cost. Limitations include slightly worse robustness under extreme attacks. Overall, MICRO sets a new state-of-the-art for model-based offline RL.
