# [Object-Centric Instruction Augmentation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots need to understand both object identities (the "what") and locations (the "where") to perform manipulation tasks effectively from natural language instructions. 
- Prior work with large language models focuses more on task planning from instructions, but less on conveying positional information.
- Learning object locations directly from visual inputs is challenging and sample-inefficient.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Object-Centric Instruction Augmentation (OCI) framework to augment language instructions with absolute and relative position information of target objects.
- Use a fine-tuned multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to weave positional knowledge into natural language.
- Propose a feature reuse mechanism to repurpose MLLM's visual-language feature embedding to aid policy learning, avoiding repeated MLLM computations.

Key Contributions:
- Established a pipeline to equip MLLM with position-aware capabilities to augment instructions with object locations.
- Introduced a feature reuse mechanism to transfer MLLM knowledge into policy networks.
- Demonstrated superior performance of OCI over baselines on both simulated and real-world robotic tasks through empirical evaluations.  
- Showed the importance of both absolute and relative position instructions via ablation studies.

In summary, the paper presents an object-centric instruction augmentation approach to convey positional cues through text to facilitate better generalization of manipulation policies to novel scenes. The reuse of MLLM features also improves sample efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Object-Centric Instruction Augmentation framework that enhances language instructions for robotic manipulation by incorporating absolute and relative position information of objects using a multi-modal large language model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It establishes a pipeline that equips multi-modal large language models (MLLM) with position-aware knowledge, enabling them to augment incoming instructions with object-centric information like absolute and relative positions of objects. 

2. It introduces a feature reuse mechanism that incorporates feature embeddings from the MLLM into the policy networks to improve policy learning. 

3. It provides empirical evaluations and ablations on both simulated and real robots that validate the superiority of their framework over existing baselines that use only flat language instructions.

In summary, the key innovation is augmenting language instructions with positional information about objects to better guide robot manipulation policies, as well as reusing MLLM features to further improve policy learning. The experiments demonstrate improved performance over baseline methods not utilizing this object-centric augmentation and feature reuse.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Object-Centric Instruction Augmentation (OCI): The proposed framework to augment language instructions for robotic manipulation with object position information. 

- Absolute position: Specifies the exact spatial location of an object using bounding boxes.

- Relative position: Describes an object's position relative to the robot using directional terms like "left" and "right".  

- Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM): Pretrained model that understands vision and language, used to generate augmented instructions.

- Feature reuse mechanism: Method to repurpose MLLM embeddings to enhance policy learning without high computational costs.  

- Manipulation tasks: The robotics applications focused on in this work, like pick-and-place.

- Simulation experiments: Tests conducted in simulated environments like Franka Kitchen.  

- Real-world experiments: Physical robot tests with a Franka arm to validate performance.

The key ideas focus on augmenting language instructions for robotic manipulation by incorporating object position information from a multi-modal language model, and reusing features to improve policy learning. The approach is evaluated on both simulation and real-world tasks.
