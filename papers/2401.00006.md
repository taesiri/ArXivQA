# [Building Open-Ended Embodied Agent via Language-Policy Bidirectional   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Building open-ended learning agents that can continuously acquire new skills and handle diverse human instructions remains challenging. Existing methods using pre-trained language models (LLMs) struggle with real-time contextual understanding, while reinforcement learning (RL) methods face efficiency issues for exploration.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes OpenContra, a co-training framework that combines LLMs and goal-conditioned RL (GRL) to construct an open-ended agent. The framework has two stages:

1. Independent Training: 
- Fine-tune an LLM to translate human instructions into structured goals based on environment states. Use multi-step prompting and fine-tuning strategies to enhance precision.
- Warm-start a GRL agent with non-goal RL to acquire basic skills. Then use curriculum strategies like hindsight goal generation to expand goal achievement space.

2. Collaborative Training:
- Continue to train LLM and GRL agent to mutually adapt and improve instruction consistency and goal achievement. 
- Use an RLAF method to provide multifactor rewards to LLM based on goal completion, key sub-goal presence, etc. Periodically reset LLM to avoid local optima.

The framework is evaluated on Contra, a complex battle royale game. Goals have 68 possible sub-dimensions, posing an open-ended challenge.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes one of the first practical frameworks to combine LLMs and RL for constructing open-ended embodied agents.
- Introduces comprehensive strategies for independent and collaborative training of components.
- Demonstrates promising performance on complex FPS game by generating high-quality goals for arbitrary instructions and achieving high goal completion ratios.
- Sets strong benchmark for future open-ended learning research by releasing Contra platform.

Overall the paper makes significant progress towards building practically useful open-ended agents that can handle diverse human instructions through an efficient LLM+RL approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a co-training framework called OpenContra that combines large language models and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning to build an embodied agent capable of interpreting arbitrary human instructions and achieving open-ended competence in completing corresponding goals in a complex battle royale game environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a co-training framework called OpenContra for building an open-ended embodied agent that can understand and complete arbitrary human instructions. The main contributions are:

1) It combines large language models (LLMs) and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GRL) in a novel way to achieve efficient open-ended learning. Specifically, the LLM is responsible for translating human instructions into structured goals, while the GRL agent executes those goals in the environment. 

2) It introduces a two-stage implementation: (a) Independent training of the LLM and GRL, where the LLM is fine-tuned to generate goals and the GRL agent is trained with curriculum learning to complete goals. (b) Collaborative training to make the LLM and GRL agent adapt to each other, improving the goal completion ratio for arbitrary instructions.

3) It demonstrates this framework in a complex battle royale FPS game called Contra with a vast goal space. Experiments show the agent can understand diverse human instructions and complete goals with high accuracy after collaborative training.

4) The results prove OpenContra's potential as a practical solution for constructing open-ended embodied agents that can continuously acquire skills grounded in language.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel co-training framework combining LLMs and GRL to achieve open-ended learning for embodied agents following human instructions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Open-ended learning - Building agents capable of continuously acquiring new skills and creating new behaviors without predefined limits. A core focus of this research.

- Language models (LLMs) - Large pre-trained neural network models that can generate text. Used here as an interface to translate human instructions into structured goals.

- Reinforcement learning (RL) - Training agents by having them interact with an environment and providing rewards/punishments. Used here to train goal-conditioned policies to execute goals. 

- Goal-conditioned RL - Reinforcement learning paradigm where an agent tries to complete goals sampled from a predefined goal space. Enables open-ended learning over the goal space.  

- Co-training - Simultaneous, collaborative training of the LLM and RL modules to enable them to adapt to each other. A key contribution of this work.

- Battle royale game - FPS game genre with last-man-standing gameplay. \Contra{} game used as the testbed here.

- Completion ratio - Metric used to evaluate ability of agent to complete arbitrarily instructed goals. Higher is better.

- Distributed RL - Leveraging a cluster of machines for efficient parallelized data collection and training. Used here to scale RL training.

The core ideas focus on using co-training of language models and reinforcement learning to achieve open-ended learning for embodied agents following human instructions. The Battle Royale domain poses challenges that test these capabilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a co-training framework between a large language model (LLM) and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. What are the key benefits of this co-training approach compared to training the LLM and RL modules independently? How does it enable open-endedness over the instruction and goal spaces?

2. The first stage of the framework involves independent training of the LLM for goal generation and curriculum goal-conditioned RL for goal execution. What are the motivations and rationales behind explicitly separating the basic skill learning and goal-conditioned learning for the RL agent? 

3. The paper introduces a multi-step fine-tuning approach for the LLM, including CoT-assisted fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning and ensemble fine-tuning. What is the purpose of each step and how do they collectively enhance the LLM's goal generation capabilities?

4. Explain the manual curriculum strategy employed for warm-starting the goal-conditioned RL agent before the co-training stage. Why is an automatic curriculum like UED not suitable in this context and how does the paper's curriculum approach alleviate issues like sparse rewards? 

5. The hindsight goal generator trains on state-goal pairs extracted from RL trajectories. What is the procedure used to construct these training samples? How does this goal generator complement random goal sampling during curriculum RL training?

6. The collaborative training stage adapts the LLM and RL agent to each other bidirectionally. How specifically does the introduced Reinforcement Learning with Agent Feedback (RLAF) optimize the LLM towards goals executable by the agent? 

7. What is the motivation behind periodically resetting the LLM during co-training? How does this help avoid local convergence and enhance goal consistency as well as completion ratio?

8. The distributed training system incorporates Actor-Learner architecture and surgical methods to enable sample efficiency and environment robustness. Elaborate on these techniques and how they facilitate scalable open-ended learning.

9. While the framework is evaluated in a complex Battle Royale game environment, what are some key limitations that need to be addressed in future work related to goal space formulation, input-output modality and environment stationarity? 

10. The paper claims the proposed framework is a practical solution for constructing open-ended embodied agents. Do you agree with this claim? Substantiate your perspective through a critical discussion of the results and appropriate comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
