# [Bias in Language Models: Beyond Trick Tests and Toward RUTEd Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12649)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bias benchmarks are commonly used to study negative impacts of bias in large language models (LLMs), but there is little evidence that these benchmarks actually indicate how real-world harms could manifest.  
- Many bias benchmarks are based on contrived, isolated text snippets not grounded in realistic use cases. The authors refer to these as "trick tests".
- There is a need to understand if trick tests correspond to evaluations based on realistic use that have tangible connections to harm (referred to as RUTEd evaluations).

Methods:
- The authors compare trick tests of gender-occupation bias to analogous RUTEd evaluations applied to long-form text generation tasks.
- Trick tests adapted from literature: 
    1) WinoBias sentence completion
    2) Sentence completion with male/female words 
    3) Gender Sensitivity benchmark
- RUTEd generation tasks:
    1) Children's bedtime stories  
    2) User personas
    3) ESL learning exercises
- Same bias metrics calculated for each trick test and RUTEd task across 7 LLMs.

Results: 
- No correspondence found between trick tests and RUTEd evaluations. 
- Selecting the least biased model based on trick tests matches the least biased model for RUTEd tasks at chance level.
- Bias metrics across different RUTEd tasks are also uncorrelated.

Conclusions:
- Evaluations not based in realistic use are insufficient to assess bias and potential real-world harms from LLMs.  
- More RUTEd evaluations are needed that match real use cases and connect to tangible harms.
- Need to move away from isolated trick tests toward grounded evaluations tailored to specific use contexts.

Main Contributions:
- First empirical demonstration of lack of correlation between standard trick test evaluations and RUTEd evaluations for studying bias in LLMs
- Introduction of RUTEd concept and articulation of need for more grounded evaluations connected to potential real-world impacts
- Results highlight challenges in generalizing bias metrics across tasks and need for custom, context-specific assessments
