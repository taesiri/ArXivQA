# [Colorizing Monochromatic Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12184)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Colorizing Monochromatic Radiance Fields":

Problem:
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) can produce colorful 3D representations of scenes from a set of RGB images. However, they fail to generate color when provided with only monochromatic images as input. 
- Colorizing monochromatic radiance fields is challenging as it requires ensuring both plausibility (visually reasonable appearance) and vividness (high color saturation) of the results.
- Existing methods either fail to produce coherent colors across views or lack vividness.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose ColorNeRF, which takes a representation prediction approach in CIE Lab color space. 
- First construct luminance and density representations using the monochromatic images.
- Then predict the missing color channels (a and b) using an image colorization module.
- Employ a query-based strategy to colorize rendered luminance samples multiple times to incorporate various possible colors.
- Propose a histogram-guided purification module to remove color outliers.
- Formulate color injection as a classification task to preserve extensive color distribution and enhance vividness.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to generate plausible and vivid radiance fields from monochromatic images.
- Representation prediction paradigm specifically designed for monochromatic radiance field colorization.
- Query-based colorization and histogram purification for strong plausibility across views.
- Classification-based color injection for highly vivid results.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results on synthetic and real monochromatic datasets.
- Demonstrate potential for rejuvenating old monochromatic archives.
