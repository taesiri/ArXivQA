# [Adversarial Training with OCR Modality Perturbation for Scene-Text   Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scene Text Visual Question Answering (ST-VQA) aims to understand scene text in images and answer related questions. 
- Existing methods rely heavily on optical character recognition (OCR) which can have errors due to issues like blurring, distortion, etc. in scene images.  
- Aggressive fine-tuning on limited spatial information and erroneous OCR texts leads to overfitting.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes an adversarial training architecture called ATS tailored for ST-VQA.  
- Introduces an Adversarial OCR Enhancement (AOE) module that uses adversarial training in OCR embedding space to make the representations fault-tolerant to OCR errors.
- Incorporates a Spatial-Aware Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism in AOE to help capture spatial relationships between OCR tokens.
- Uses adversarial training as regularization to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

Main Contributions:
- First to design adversarial training architectures for ST-VQA to learn fault-tolerant OCR representations.
- Uses relative position embeddings instead of absolute embeddings in SASA to provide broader perspective for spatial modeling.   
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on ST-VQA and TextVQA benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness.
- Provides a novel paradigm for multimodal adversarial training.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel adversarial training framework with spatial modeling capabilities tailored for ST-VQA that achieves superior performance over existing methods. The main ideas are enhancing fault tolerance using adversarial OCR perturbations and spatial-aware self-attention.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adversarial training framework with an Adversarial OCR Enhancement module and Spatial-Aware Self-Attention for scene text visual question answering to learn fault-tolerant representations of OCR texts and better capture spatial relationships among them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose the first adversarial training architecture for the ST-VQA task, which can force the model to learn a fault-tolerant representation of OCR texts to improve generalization performance. 

2) Instead of using absolute position embeddings for OCR tokens, they utilize relative position embeddings to provide a broader perspective for spatial modeling of extended text contexts.

3) Their approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on extensive experimental tests on the popular ST-VQA and TextVQA benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is an adversarial training framework with spatial modeling capabilities that enhances the fault tolerance of OCR text representations, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance on ST-VQA tasks.
