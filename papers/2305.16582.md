# Beyond Chain-of-Thought, Effective Graph-of-Thought Reasoning in Large   Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can large language models (LLMs) be enhanced to better capture the non-sequential, graph-like nature of human reasoning and problem solving? The key hypothesis is that modeling reasoning processes as graphs rather than linear chains will allow LLMs to perform more complex, human-like deductive reasoning and generate more accurate answers to reasoning tasks.In particular, the paper proposes representing reasoning as a "Graph-of-Thought" (GoT) rather than just a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The GoT models reasoning steps as connected nodes in a graph structure rather than a simple linear chain. The authors hypothesize that integrating GoT graph representations along with textual and visual features will improve the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks compared to only using CoT chains or textual/visual features alone.The paper aims to test this central hypothesis by implementing GoT reasoning in LLMs and evaluating on text-only and multimodal reasoning datasets. The goal is to demonstrate that modeling reasoning as graph structures rather than chains enables more human-like deductive reasoning and stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.In summary, the core research question is whether Graph-of-Thought can enhance reasoning abilities in LLMs beyond current Chain-of-Thought and multimodal methods. The central hypothesis is that the graph structure will better capture human reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning, a new approach to model human reasoning processes as graphs instead of simple chains. GoT represents thought units as nodes and connections between them as edges, capturing the non-sequential nature of human thinking. 2. Implementing GoT reasoning by constructing thought graphs with an Extract-Cluster-Coreference process and encoding the graphs with a graph attention network. The graph features are fused with text and visual features using a gated fusion mechanism.3. Evaluating GoT reasoning on the GSM8K and ScienceQA benchmarks. GoT significantly outperforms strong baselines like GPT-3, Multimodal-CoT, and even exceeds human performance on ScienceQA.4. Conducting comprehensive ablation studies and analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of GoT in improving reasoning and deductive abilities. The results show incorporating thought graph features and graph encoding enhances model performance, especially on complex, higher-level reasoning tasks.5. Establishing new state-of-the-art results on GSM8K and ScienceQA datasets using GoT reasoning, while using significantly fewer parameters than models like GPT-3 and GPT-4.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Graph-of-Thought to model reasoning as graphs instead of chains, and showing this approach effectively improves reasoning abilities of large language models like T5 with fewer parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of GoT in unlocking stronger reasoning for LLMs.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning, which models human thought processes as graphs rather than just chains, and shows this improves the reasoning abilities of large language models like T5 on complex tasks involving text, images, and logical deductions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on reasoning and thought processes in large language models:- This paper introduces a novel approach called Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning, which models the reasoning process as a graph rather than a sequential chain. This differs from most prior work like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting that represents reasoning as linear chains of thought. Modeling reasoning as a graph better captures the non-linear nature of human thinking.- While some prior work has explored multimodal reasoning by incorporating visual features, this paper proposes a more nuanced integration of textual, visual, and graph-based features through techniques like graph attention networks and gated fusion. The graph component specifically targets improving deductive reasoning abilities.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmark reasoning datasets like GSM8K and ScienceQA, significantly outperforming prior CoT methods. The gains are especially pronounced on complex, higher-level reasoning questions. This shows the value of the graph-based approach.- Compared to methods that prompt large pretrained models like GPT-3, this paper takes a fine-tuning based approach that is more parameter-efficient. Performance competitive with 175B parameter models is achieved with only 250M parameters.- The proposed model architecture modularly combines different encoders for text, images, and graphs with gated fusion techniques. This provides a flexible framework for multimodal reasoning.Overall, by modeling reasoning as interconnected graphs, this work makes an important contribution over prior chain-based approaches. The results demonstrate strong gains over CoT prompting and fine-tuning methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art. The graphical modeling better reflects the complexity of human reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring different methods for constructing the Graph-of-Thought beyond the proposed Extract-Cluster-Coreference approach, such as incorporating knowledge graphs or other structured data to build richer thought graphs. - Experimenting with different graph encoding methods beyond graph attention networks, such as graph neural networks, to model the relationships and information flow in the thought graph.- Applying Graph-of-Thought to a wider range of reasoning tasks beyond math and science QA, such as commonsense reasoning, causal reasoning, etc. to further demonstrate its capabilities.- Combining Graph-of-Thought with other reasoning techniques like neural-symbolic systems to integrate both sub-symbolic graph reasoning and explicit logic-based reasoning.- Developing methods to construct explanatory graphs and provide natural language justifications to make the Graph-of-Thought reasoning process more interpretable. - Scaling up Graph-of-Thought to even larger language models to take advantage of their greater reasoning capacity.- Reducing the computational overhead of Graph-of-Thought while retaining effectiveness.In summary, the main future directions focus on improving Graph-of-Thought construction, exploring alternative encoders, applying it to more tasks, integrating other reasoning techniques, enhancing interpretability, and improving scalability. The key goal is to advance graph-based reasoning for language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel Graph-of-Thought (GoT) approach to model human reasoning processes in large language models. GoT represents thought units as nodes and connections between them as edges in a graph structure, capturing the non-sequential nature of human thinking. The authors implement GoT as a two-stage framework on top of the T5 model - first generating rationales conditioned on the input text, image, and constructed GoT graph, then producing the final answer based on predicted rationales. They employ an Extract-Cluster-Coreference process to construct the GoT graph and use a graph attention network to encode it. Experiments on the GSM8K and ScienceQA datasets show GoT significantly outperforms strong CoT baselines and achieves new SOTA results, demonstrating the efficacy of modeling reasoning as graph structures rather than chains. Key innovations include the ECC process for GoT construction and gated fusion of text, visual, and graph features.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a novel Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning approach to model human thought processes in a non-sequential, graph-based manner within large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to represent thought units as nodes and connections between thoughts as edges, forming a thought graph. This allows capturing the rich, non-linear nature of human thinking beyond just sequential chains of thought. The authors implement GoT reasoning via a two-stage framework - generating rationales first using the thought graph, then producing the final answer. Specifically, they employ additional encoders for thought graph representation learning and fuse this with the original input via gated fusion. Experiments on text-only and multimodal reasoning tasks show GoT significantly improves over strong baselines including Chain-of-Thought and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ScienceQA dataset.Paragraph 2: The paper introduces an innovative Extract-Cluster-Coreference process to construct meaningful thought graphs that simulate human deductive reasoning. A graph attention network then encodes the graph, fusing it with input text and image features using cross-attention and gated fusion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate GoT's superiority over CoT on the GSM8K dataset and state-of-the-art performance on ScienceQA, even exceeding human accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of modeling reasoning as a thought graph. Case studies provide insights into GoT's ability for robust deductive reasoning. The work illustrates the potential of incorporating graph-structured representations of thought processes to enhance reasoning in LLMs.
