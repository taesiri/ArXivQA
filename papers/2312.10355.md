# [CoAScore: Chain-of-Aspects Prompting for NLG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- NLG evaluation has shifted from single-aspect to multi-aspect assessments for more accurate quality measurement. 
- Large language models (LLMs) achieve great performance on NLG tasks but current works mostly evaluate aspects independently, ignoring correlations between them.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes CoAScore, an LLM-based NLG evaluation metric utilizing a chain-of-aspects prompting framework.  
- For a target aspect to evaluate, CoAScore first generates a chain of relevant aspects using the LLM. These aspects are scored for quality beforehand. 
- Finally, the knowledge of relevant aspects, including descriptions and scores, is integrated to enhance the LLM's evaluation capability for the target aspect.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of CoAScore metric that employs LLM to create, measure, combine and leverage a sequence of relevant aspects as references to improve evaluation of a target aspect.
- Experiments across 9 aspects and 5 datasets show CoAScore correlates better with human judgments than individual aspect evaluation and outperforms existing unsupervised metrics.
- Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the 3 stages in CoAScore. Case studies illustrate how the LLM works in these stages.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel LLM-based NLG evaluation metric CoAScore that utilizes a chain-of-aspects prompting framework to leverage knowledge of relevant aspects for enhancing the assessment of a target aspect. Experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CoAScore, a novel NLG evaluation metric that employs a chain-of-aspects prompting framework with large language models to leverage knowledge of relevant aspects for more accurate multi-aspect assessment of system-generated text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose a novel evaluation metric called CoAScore that utilizes a chain-of-aspects prompting framework. This framework uses a large language model (LLM) to generate a chain of relevant aspects related to the target aspect being evaluated. It scores each generated aspect and then leverages the knowledge about these aspects to improve evaluation of the target aspect.

2. Experiment results demonstrate that CoAScore correlates better with human judgments across various NLG evaluation tasks and aspects, compared to both rule-based metrics and machine-learned metrics.

3. The authors conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the three stages in the CoAScore framework. They also provide case studies to illustrate how the LLM works during these stages.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of CoAScore, a new LLM-based evaluation metric that employs a chain-of-aspects approach to improve multi-aspect evaluation for natural language generation systems. Both empirical results and detailed analysis are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

The paper introduces a new LLM-based NLG evaluation metric called CoAScore that utilizes a chain-of-aspects prompting framework. It generates and scores a chain of relevant aspects to help evaluate a target aspect of interest. Experiments are conducted on evaluating overall quality and other specific aspects for tasks like dialog response generation and text summarization. The key ideas focus on leveraging multi-aspect knowledge and the capabilities of LLMs to enhance NLG evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing the CoAScore metric? How does it aim to address limitations in existing NLG evaluation metrics?

2. Explain the overall framework and key stages involved in CoAScore. How does it leverage knowledge of relevant aspects to aid evaluation of a target aspect? 

3. Why does the paper argue that independent evaluation of aspects in NLG systems overlooks interrelationships between them? Provide some examples of such interrelationships.

4. How does CoAScore generate and select relevant aspects in Stage 1? What experiments were done to validate this approach over just using aspects in the dataset?

5. In Stage 2, what is the importance of scoring each relevant aspect before final evaluation? What happens if random scores are assigned instead?

6. Explain the prompting structure and information provided to the LLM in Stage 3 for final evaluation. Why is directly averaging scores of aspects not as effective?

7. Analyze the correlation results between CoAScore and human judgments. How does performance vary with number of aspects? What explains this trend?  

8. Compare CoAScore's correlation with human judgments to the machine-learned and rule-based baseline metrics discussed. What explanations are provided for CoAScore's stronger performance?

9. Discuss the case studies provided in the paper. How do they demonstrate CoAScore's ability to better align with human judgments compared to the LLM baseline?

10. What avenues for future work are identified? What potential strategies are discussed to further improve efficiency and applicability of the CoAScore framework?
