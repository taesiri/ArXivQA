# [CoAScore: Chain-of-Aspects Prompting for NLG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- NLG evaluation has shifted from single-aspect to multi-aspect assessments for more accurate quality measurement. 
- Large language models (LLMs) achieve great performance on NLG tasks but current works mostly evaluate aspects independently, ignoring correlations between them.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes CoAScore, an LLM-based NLG evaluation metric utilizing a chain-of-aspects prompting framework.  
- For a target aspect to evaluate, CoAScore first generates a chain of relevant aspects using the LLM. These aspects are scored for quality beforehand. 
- Finally, the knowledge of relevant aspects, including descriptions and scores, is integrated to enhance the LLM's evaluation capability for the target aspect.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of CoAScore metric that employs LLM to create, measure, combine and leverage a sequence of relevant aspects as references to improve evaluation of a target aspect.
- Experiments across 9 aspects and 5 datasets show CoAScore correlates better with human judgments than individual aspect evaluation and outperforms existing unsupervised metrics.
- Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the 3 stages in CoAScore. Case studies illustrate how the LLM works in these stages.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel LLM-based NLG evaluation metric CoAScore that utilizes a chain-of-aspects prompting framework to leverage knowledge of relevant aspects for enhancing the assessment of a target aspect. Experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
