# [Combining topic modelling and citation network analysis to study case   law from the European Court on Human Rights on the right to respect for   private and family life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16429)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Case law databases are rapidly growing, making it challenging for legal scholars to efficiently find relevant cases and gain a comprehensive understanding of the vast information. 
- Traditional legal research methods struggle to discover overarching topics, trends or patterns within large case law collections.
- Computational techniques like topic modelling and citation network analysis could offer solutions, but their usefulness for organizing and studying case law has not been compared or combined before.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper demonstrates and compares topic modelling and citation network analysis for collecting and organizing case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
- Three experiments are conducted using two data sets:
    1) All English case law on Article 8 (n=6,854)
    2) Manually collected subset of eviction cases (n=198)
- Experiment 1 applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling to cluster cases based on topics.
- Experiment 2 uses the Louvain algorithm to detect communities in the citation network, grouping interconnected cases.
- Experiment 3 combines both methods to assess if an integrated text and citation-based approach leads to better results in finding relevant cases.

Main Contributions:
- The paper shows LDA can provide an overview of topics in case law but fails to fully capture specific subtopics like eviction. 
- Citation network analysis also did not adequately identify all eviction cases.
- Combining topic modelling with community detection leads to the most effective results in retrieving and organizing relevant cases. The integrated method identified 83 additional eviction cases.
- The study highlights the need for a guided approach supplementing computational techniques with legal expertise for improved case law analysis.
- It demonstrates the promise of merging text-based and citation-based methods for organizing legal data and enhancing understanding.

The paper makes key contributions in evaluating and enhancing computational approaches for efficient case law analysis at scale.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper compares and combines topic modeling and citation network analysis to develop an enhanced computational method for organizing legal case law from the European Court of Human Rights, using cases related to evictions under Article 8 as a test set to evaluate the methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating that combining topic modeling and citation network analysis leads to better results in finding, organizing and analyzing case law compared to using only one of these methods. 

Specifically, the paper shows that:

- Using topic modeling (LDA) alone provides an overview of themes in the case law, but does not reliably identify more specific subtopics like eviction cases. A portion of eviction cases are missed.

- Using only citation network analysis and community detection also fails to reliably identify all the eviction cases, again missing a substantial portion. 

- However, combining topic modeling similarity scores with the citation network analysis allows strengthening connections between similar cases. Using this combined approach leads to identifying smaller, more interconnected communities of cases that have a higher concentration of eviction cases. It also allows discovering new eviction cases that were missed with the other approaches.

So in summary, the key insight is that integrating the textual content and citation patterns of cases enables more effective retrieval and organization of case law centered around specific topics like evictions, compared to using either data source in isolation. This demonstrates the value of a combined computational and legal expert-guided approach.

The paper focuses on applying and comparing topic modelling and citation network analysis techniques to organize and analyze a large collection of case law from the ECtHR related to Article 8 and evictions. It experiments with using LDA for topic modelling, the Louvain algorithm for community detection in citation networks, and a combined approach to improve case retrieval.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper applies both topic modeling (using LDA) and network analysis (using the Louvain algorithm) to analyze case law. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods in identifying relevant cases on a specific issue like eviction? 

2. When applying LDA for topic modeling, the authors had to determine the optimal number of topics. What procedure did they use to decide on the best number of topics and why was this important?

3. The resolution parameter in the Louvain algorithm influences the size and number of detected communities. How did the authors show the effect of this parameter and why does this pose a challenge in identifying coherent communities?  

4. What was the main idea behind the authors' proposed method of combining topic modeling and network analysis? How does incorporating textual similarity scores for the links in the citation network help in community detection?

5. The authors focus their analysis on a subset of eviction cases to evaluate their methods. What were the criteria used to manually collect this subset and what potential limitations does this introduce?  

6. When analyzing the eviction cases using the combined topic+network approach, the authors detect over 80 new relevant cases in addition to their original subset. What does this suggest about the utility of their proposed computational method?

7. What percentage of Article 8 cases fall outside the main giant subnetwork component analyzed in Experiments 2 and 3? What implications could this have for attempts to fully automate case law analysis?  

8. How do the sizes of the detected eviction-related communities compare between using just network analysis vs. the combined topic+network method? What accounts for these differences?

9. What are some ways the authors could further improve or extend their proposed computational method for case law analysis in future work? 

10. The authors analyze case law from the ECtHR on Article 8 of the ECHR. How well do you think their method would transfer to analyzing case law from other courts or legal domains? What adaptations might be needed?
