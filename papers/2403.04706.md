# [Common 7B Language Models Already Possess Strong Math Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04706)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Prior works believed advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities emerge only in extremely large language models or those with extensive math-specific pretraining. This paper challenges that notion by showing the LLaMA-2 7B model already possesses strong inherent math reasoning abilities. However, the primary issue is the instability in eliciting correct answers consistently. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors demonstrate simply scaling up the amount of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) math data leads to significant performance gains. To enable further scaling beyond existing datasets, they propose using GPT-4 Turbo to synthesize new mathematical questions and solutions. This synthetic data proves to be nearly as effective as real data. By expanding to 960K synthetic samples, the method lifts state-of-the-art accuracy on GSM8K to 82.6% and on MATH to 40.6% using just a standard 7B LLaMA-2 model, exceeding more complex approaches.

Key Contributions:
- Reveals 7B LLaMA-2 already has strong mathematical capabilities, challenging common beliefs larger models are necessary 
- Shows scaling synthetic SFT data is a simple yet effective approach to enhance reliability in eliciting capabilities
- Pushes SOTA accuracy on GSM8K (82.6%) and MATH (40.6%) using just LLaMA-2 7B, surpassing more complex methods
- Provides analysis into error types, reasoning complexity scaling, avoiding benchmark overfitting, etc. to glean insights

In summary, this work makes both empirical and analytical contributions demonstrating surprising inherent reasoning abilities in smaller models can be unlocked through straightforward synthetic data scaling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates that common 7B language models already possess strong mathematical capabilities, and that scaling up supervised fine-tuning data with synthetic math questions can significantly enhance the reliability and state-of-the-art performance of eliciting those capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that common 7B language models like LLaMA-2 already possess strong mathematical capabilities. By significantly scaling up the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data using synthetic math questions, the paper shows that the stability and reliability of these models in solving math problems can be greatly improved. 

Specifically, by scaling the SFT data to about 1 million samples, the LLaMA-2 7B model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.6\% on the GSM8K benchmark and 40.6\% on the MATH benchmark. This simple scaling method using synthetic data enables smaller common language models to match or even exceed the performance of larger models dedicated to mathematical reasoning.

The paper also provides insights into the scaling behavior, such as how single-step reasoning accuracy and different error types change with more SFT data. Overall, it demonstrates the potential of synthetic SFT data scaling to unlock innate mathematical capabilities in general-purpose language models.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims that common 7B models already have strong inherent mathematical capabilities. Why do you think this capability has been overlooked in previous work? What evidence supports the authors' claim?

2. The authors use synthetic data to further scale up the SFT data. What are the main challenges in generating valid and diverse synthetic math questions at scale? How does the paper's approach for synthetic data generation address these challenges?

3. The paper finds that synthetic math questions are nearly as effective as real questions for improving model performance. What factors may contribute to the high quality of the synthetic data? How could the synthetic data approach be further improved?
