# [Spacewalk-18: A Benchmark for Multimodal and Long-form Procedural Video   Understanding in Novel Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18773)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Spacewalk-18, a new benchmark for multimodal, long-form procedural video understanding in novel domains. The dataset contains 96 hours of densely annotated video from 18 spacewalk missions outside the International Space Station. To efficiently collect temporal segment labels, the authors develop a new annotation protocol that pre-defines the label space and pre-segments the videos. They propose two tasks on this dataset: step recognition, which tests generalization ability using out-of-domain visuals and multimodal cues; and intra-video retrieval for unsupervised temporal segmentation. Experiments show that state-of-the-art video-language models perform poorly on these tasks, unable to effectively utilize long context or multimodal signals. Further analysis confirms humans can solve the tasks decently and rely on both modalities and long-term context. The authors conclude that current models fall short of structured temporal understanding of procedural video in new environments. The work motivates developing models that can incorporate multimodal evidence across long horizons and generalize across domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Spacewalk-18, a new multimodal long-form video understanding benchmark for procedural video temporal segmentation containing footage of International Space Station spacewalks, which current state-of-the-art models perform poorly on, indicating their inability to generalize to novel domains, jointly leverage modalities effectively, or comprehend long context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content in the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. The authors propose a new procedural video benchmark for extracting structured temporal representations, approximated by the step recognition and intra-video retrieval tasks. 

2. They collect the Spacewalk-18 dataset with 96 hours of densely annotated videos spanning over 456 animated steps using a new efficient annotation protocol. 

3. The authors conduct extensive experiments and human evaluations that demonstrate the importance of multimodal evidence from long temporal context. Their analysis highlights the need for future video-language models capable of incorporating such evidence and generalizing to novel domains.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of a new benchmark and dataset to advance multimodal, long-form, procedural video understanding models that can generalize to unseen environments.

The paper introduces the new Spacewalk-18 benchmark for evaluating video-language models on tasks like step recognition and intra-video retrieval in long-form procedural videos from a novel domain (spacewalks). Key goals are assessing generalization abilities and the use of multimodal context, with poor performance of current models demonstrating room for progress. The dataset itself, annotation protocol, analysis, and tasks are central topics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two tasks - step recognition and intra-video retrieval - as intermediate benchmarks towards the goal of temporal video segmentation with novel domains. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using these proxy tasks instead of directly evaluating temporal segmentation?

2. The paper finds that current video-language models still struggle on the Spacewalk-18 benchmark, even after last-layer fine-tuning. What types of architectural changes or self-supervised pre-training strategies could help models better leverage long-range context and generalize to new domains? 

3. The authors design an efficient annotation protocol to collect structured labels and temporal boundaries from long videos. Could similar protocols be developed to annotate other challenging long-form video datasets more efficiently? What are the limitations?

4. How does the temporal certificate metric quantify the contextual reasoning requirements of different video understanding benchmarks? Why does Spacewalk-18 require longer contextual reasoning than other existing benchmarks?

5. The paper demonstrates the multimodal nature of the Spacewalk-18 benchmark through human studies and model ablations. However, current models still fail to effectively leverage both video and text signals jointly. What are some ways to better fuse multimodal context in video-language models?

6. Why does directly learning to segment videos into steps remain an extremely challenging open problem? What intermediate proxies other than step recognition and intra-video retrieval could be proposed to make progress towards this goal? 

7. The paper finds optimal context lengths between 3-10 mins for step recognition and 20 secs - 1 min for intra-video retrieval. What explains this discrepancy? How can models determine the appropriate context lengths in an unsupervised manner?

8. What types of background knowledge and common sense would be required for models to understand novel domains like spacewalks without any domain-specific training data? How can we effectively incorporate such knowledge into models?

9. The paper demonstrates that current models fail to effectively adapt to the spacewalk domain even with last layer fine-tuning. What other adaptation strategies could help models generalize better to unseen domains with limited in-domain labeled data?

10. Beyond accuracy, what other evaluation metrics could reveal more insights into a model's understanding of long-form, multimodal procedural videos? How can the benchmarks be made more challenging?
