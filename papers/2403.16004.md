# [A Federated Parameter Aggregation Method for Node Classification Tasks   with Different Graph Network Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16004)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) require large amounts of data to achieve good performance. However, data is often distributed across multiple clients and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. 

- Existing federated learning methods for GNNs assume the graph structure is the same across clients. However, in many real-world scenarios, clients have graphs with different nodes, edges, and edge types.

- There is a need for federated learning methods that can work with GNNs in the presence of heterogeneous graph structures across clients.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FLGNN, a federated learning framework for GNNs that can handle different graph structures across clients. 

- Clients train GNN models locally and only share the weight parameters with a central server. By not sharing node features or graphs, privacy is preserved.

- The server aggregates the weight parameters from all clients to construct a global model. Both single-layer and multi-layer aggregation strategies are explored.

- For handling different edge types, the paper proposes FLGNN+ which assigns dynamic aggregation weights to each client based on model accuracy feedback.

Main Contributions:
- FLGNN enables federated learning for GNNs with heterogeneous graph structures across clients, through sharing and aggregation of GNN weight parameters.

- Experiments on real-world datasets show FLGNN matches the performance of centralized training within 1-2% accuracy drop, outperforming individual client training.

- FLGNN+ can handle different edge types across clients via dynamic weight assignment and improves over simple average aggregation.

- Privacy analysis shows FLGNN is robust to membership inference attacks. Addition of differential privacy noise further reduces attack success rate.

- The proposed methods advance the applicability of federated learning to real-world GNN use cases with distributed heterogeneous graph data.
