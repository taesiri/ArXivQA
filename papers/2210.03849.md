# [ConvFinQA: Exploring the Chain of Numerical Reasoning in Conversational   Finance Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03849)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research questions this paper addresses are:

1. Which is the more fundamental approach for solving complex reasoning problems - neural symbolic models or prompting-based methods using large language models?

2. How well do these two approaches perform on a new complex reasoning task involving conversational question answering and numerical reasoning over financial reports?

3. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach on this new task? What insights can be gained?

Specifically, the authors propose a new dataset called ConvFinQA for conversational question answering that requires complex numerical reasoning over financial reports. They conduct experiments using both neural symbolic models and prompting-based methods on this dataset. Their goal is to analyze the reasoning mechanisms and provide insights into these two types of approaches for complex real-world reasoning tasks. The central hypothesis seems to be that prompting-based methods may start to struggle or underperform on tasks like this that require reasoning on specialized domains, compared to neural symbolic approaches designed specifically for the task.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new conversational QA dataset in the finance domain, ConvFinQA, to study complex numerical reasoning chains, and experiments with neural-symbolic and prompting methods, finding both have difficulties in learning long-range reasoning dependencies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in conversational question answering and reasoning:

- The focus on complex numerical reasoning in finance is quite novel. Most prior conversational QA datasets are in more general domains and focus on challenges like co-reference, table navigation, open-endedness, etc. This paper explores long chains of numerical reasoning which is uncommon.

- The idea of simulating conversational flows by decomposing multi-hop questions is clever. It provides a methodical way to create realistic conversations with reasoning dependencies. Most prior conversational QA datasets are collected through human-human dialogs which can be costly.

- Using a specialized domain like finance sets this work apart from recent advances in reasoning for large LMs. Those tend to use more general math/common sense reasoning tasks. This paper shows prompting large LMs may struggle on complex new domains.

- Comparing neural symbolic and prompting-based approaches on this dataset provides insights into their reasoning mechanisms. Neural symbolic can learn reasoning patterns with full training data. Prompting probes the knowledge already within LMs. But both struggle with long chains of reasoning in this new domain.

- The limitation of constructing only two types of conversational flows means there are still many phenomena in real human conversations not covered. But it's a good first step towards more diverse reasoning-focused conversational QA.

Overall, I would say this paper makes a very novel contribution by constructing a dataset to probe complex, multi-turn numerical reasoning in a specialized domain. The comparisons of reasoning approaches are insightful. There are still limitations like the diversity of conversations, but it seems to advance research in conversational reasoning in a meaningful way compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Continuing to explore complex, real-world reasoning tasks as a challenge for AI systems. The authors propose their new ConvFinQA dataset as an example of such a task in the finance domain, but suggest exploring other complex real-world reasoning tasks as well. 

- Further investigating the differences between neural-symbolic reasoning methods and large language model prompting-based methods. The authors suggest exploring the strengths and limitations of each approach on different types of reasoning tasks.

- Exploring the bound between tasks that can benefit from language modeling techniques vs those that require more specialized reasoning methods. The authors are interested in analyzing what factors determine whether a task is suitable for language model based reasoning vs requiring specialized reasoning architectures.

- Developing methods to provide stronger domain knowledge and reasoning chains to models, which was a weakness identified in experiments on ConvFinQA.

- Creating more datasets that require understanding new and complex task paradigms and reasoning chains. The authors found that language models struggled on ConvFinQA since it required understanding a novel complex reasoning task.

- Continuing to analyze reasoning abilities of large language models as they scale up in size. The authors suggest that larger LMs may have improved performance on complex reasoning.

In summary, the key suggestions are to explore more complex real-world reasoning tasks, analyze neural-symbolic vs language model based reasoning, provide stronger reasoning chains and domain knowledge to models, create datasets with new task paradigms, and scale up language models. Advancing reasoning abilities on complex real-world tasks is highlighted as a major next step.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new large-scale dataset called ConvFinQA for studying complex numerical reasoning in conversational question answering over financial reports. The dataset contains 3,892 conversations with 14,115 questions constructed by decomposing and concatenating multi-hop questions from the existing FinQA dataset. The questions require chaining numerical reasoning across turns in the conversation. Experiments are conducted using both neural symbolic models trained on the full dataset and prompting-based methods with GPT-3. The key findings are: 1) Both approaches achieve less than 70% accuracy, indicating the challenge of modeling long-range reasoning chains. 2) Despite excelling at simple reasoning tasks, prompting-based methods perform much worse on ConvFinQA (less than 50% accuracy), failing to understand the new complex task paradigm. 3) More work is needed to explore complex, real-world reasoning abilities as the next research focus. The new dataset provides a valuable resource for studying reasoning in specialized domains.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset called ConvFinQA for conversational question answering in the finance domain. To construct this dataset, the authors first simulate conversation skeletons by decomposing multi-hop questions from the existing FinQA dataset into single reasoning steps. They generate two types of conversations: simple conversations from decomposing one FinQA question, and hybrid conversations from decomposing and concatenating two FinQA questions on the same report. They then hire expert annotators to realize these skeletons into natural conversational questions. The resulting dataset contains 3,892 conversations with 14,115 questions requiring complex numerical reasoning chains. The authors experiment with both neural symbolic models like specialized encoder-decoders as well as large pre-trained language models with prompting. They find that both methods still fall behind human experts, with execution accuracies below 70% compared to 89% for humans. The key challenges are long-range reasoning dependencies throughout the conversation and understanding complex reasoning paradigms for specialized domains. The authors conclude that while pre-trained LMs excel at simple reasoning tasks with prompting, they struggle on complex real-world reasoning, indicating the need for continued research on simulating human-like reasoning abilities.
