# [Planning with a Learned Policy Basis to Optimally Solve Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods can successfully solve a variety of sequential decision problems. However, learning policies that can generalize predictably across multiple tasks with non-Markovian reward specifications remains challenging. The paper aims to develop a method that can leverage previously learned knowledge to efficiently solve new tasks specified via finite state automata (FSAs), while still ensuring global optimality.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes to use successor features (SFs) to learn a policy basis, where each policy solves a well-defined sub-problem or sub-goal. For a new task that involves the same sub-problems but specified via an FSA, these policies can be combined through planning to generate an optimal solution without requiring additional learning. 

Key Ideas:
- Learn a set of policies along with their SFs that constitute a convex coverage set (CCS). This CCS forms an expressive policy basis for planning.
- Associate SF dimensions with terminal/exit states in the environment. This reduces the planning to only consider exit states rather than all states.  
- Perform value iteration style planning over the exit states based on the FSA specification to retrieve optimal weights for combining policies in the CCS. This results in the optimal policy for the task.

Contributions:
- Propose using SFs to learn a policy basis suitable for planning in stochastic domains.
- Develop a planning framework that leverages such policy bases for zero-shot generalization to complex FSA-specified tasks.
- Prove that if the CCS policies are optimal, the framework produces globally optimal solutions even in stochastic environments.

The experiments demonstrate the approach can efficiently compose optimal behavior for new unseen tasks, outperforming prior hierarchical and multi-task RL techniques. A key benefit is predictable generalization without retraining.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to learn a set of subpolicies using successor features that can be combined via planning to optimally solve complex tasks specified by finite state automata, enabling zero-shot generalization to new tasks over the same subproblems without additional learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to use successor features to learn a policy basis that can be combined via planning to retrieve globally optimal policies for complex temporal tasks specified by finite state automatons. Specifically:

- They propose to use successor features to learn a convex coverage set (CCS) of policies that constitutes an optimal policy basis for planning. 

- They develop a planning framework that leverages this CCS to generate optimal solutions for new tasks described by arbitrary finite state automatons, without needing additional learning. 

- They formally prove that if the policies in the CCS are optimal, their framework produces globally optimal solutions even in stochastic environments.

So in summary, the key contribution is a novel method to attain predictable generalization to new complex task specifications in a provably optimal manner by combining learned sub-policies via planning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Successor features - A reinforcement learning representation that allows for generalization across tasks by decomposing rewards into feature vectors. Enables generalized policy evaluation and improvement.

- Convex coverage set (CCS) - A set of policies that are optimal for different linear combinations of successor features. Allows transferring optimal policies to new tasks through planning. 

- Policy basis - The set of policies constituting a CCS that solves well-defined subproblems. Can be combined to generate an optimal policy for new tasks.

- Non-Markovian reward specifications - Reward functions that cannot be expressed purely in terms of the current state and action. Expressed using formal languages like finite state automata.

- Finite state automaton (FSA) - A formal way to specify non-Markovian tasks using states, transitions between states labeled with propositional symbols, initial/terminal states etc.

- Planning - Generating a policy by searching in a space of plans based on a model. Used here to combine policies in a CCS to solve tasks specifies by FSAs.

- Recursive/hierarchical/global optimality - Different notions of optimality when combining solutions to subtasks. Global optimality provides an overall optimal solution.

So in summary, key terms revolve around using successor features and convex coverage sets for optimal policy reuse, transferring policies for non-Markovian FSA-specified tasks through planning, and attaining global optimality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims the method can attain global optimality even in stochastic environments. What aspects of the method's design enable this capability and why can't other hierarchical approaches like options frameworks achieve the same?

2. The paper uses successor features to learn a policy basis. How does this differ from simply learning a set of options or policies? What specific advantages does using successor features provide over those alternatives? 

3. The method performs planning on the space of augmented exit states rather than the full product MDP state space. Why is this sufficient for retrieving an optimal policy and how does it improve computational efficiency?

4. Could you explain the intuition behind the feature vector design? Why is it important that the feature vectors for non-terminal transitions are zero vectors?

5. Could you walk through the update rule for the weight vectors in Eq. 6 and explain why this dynamic programming approach converges to the optimal set of weight vectors?  

6. The proof of optimality relies on showing the weight vectors output by the algorithm are optimal. Why is that sufficient to prove the overall value function and policy optimality?

7. How does the method generalize to new task specifications described by an arbitrary FSA? Does it require any additional learning when presented with a new FSA?

8. What are the key limitations of constructing a full convex coverage set of policies? When would using an Îµ-approximate CCS be preferred?

9. How suitable would the proposed method be for application in continuous state and action spaces? What adjustments would need to be made?

10. Could the high-level planning component of this approach be combined with other multi-task learning methods that acquire useful policy components? What benefits might such hybridization provide?
