# [HiFace: High-Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction by Learning Static and   Dynamic Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11225)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we reconstruct high-fidelity 3D faces with realistic and animatable details from a single image?The key points are:- The paper proposes a method called HiFace to reconstruct 3D faces with both coarse shape and fine details from a single image. - It focuses on modeling both static details (e.g. person-specific appearance) and dynamic details (e.g. expression-driven wrinkles).- The method uses a module called SD-DeTail to explicitly decouple the static and dynamic factors in facial details. - It leverages synthetic datasets with ground truth labels to help disentangle and reconstruct realistic static and dynamic details.- Novel loss functions are designed to learn coarse shapes and details simultaneously.- Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and generates animatable details that can be manipulated in a realistic way.In summary, the core research question is how to reconstruct 3D faces with high-fidelity, realistic and animatable details from single images, which existing methods struggle with. The paper proposes a new method to address this by decoupling static and dynamic details and using synthetic data supervision.
