# [Causal State Distillation for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can behave in complex ways that are difficult for humans to understand. Post-hoc explanation methods like saliency maps have limitations - they are not grounded in the agent's learning process and overlook RL-specific aspects like rewards and state transitions.

- There is a need for better ways to explain RL agent behavior that go beyond saliency maps and leverage interaction data to provide insights into why agents make certain decisions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a causal learning framework called "causal state distillation" that identifies explanatory factors from the agent's states that influence its actions and rewards. 

- The key ideas are to: (1) learn a disentangled state representation with causal factors and non-causal factors, (2) ensure causal factors have properties like sufficiency, sparsity, and orthogonality, and (3) use information-theoretic objectives to encourage these properties.

- Two paradigms are presented - R-Mask focuses on causal factors for reward prediction while Q-Mask incorporates RL objectives for learning factors predictive of Q-values. The framework can handle tasks with multiple reward channels.

Contributions:
- Formalizes RL explanations from a causal perspective and proposes explanatory factors (latent components of states) to explain agent behavior.

- Presents a principled framework with desired criteria (sufficiency, sparsity, orthogonality) for learning disentangled causal factors using information-theoretic measures.

- Provides two instantiations of the framework - R-Mask and Q-Mask, which differ in how causal factors are distilled.

- Demonstrates the framework on Atari games and shows causal factors provide more meaningful explanations than saliency maps. The factors offer multifaceted explanations that capture nuances in agent behavior.
