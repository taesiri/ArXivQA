# [UCVC: A Unified Contextual Video Compression Framework with Joint   P-frame and B-frame Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing learned video compression methods only support either P-frame coding for low latency or B-frame coding for high efficiency. They cannot flexibly choose frame types to meet different application requirements. Besides, compressing all sequences with a fixed frame type is suboptimal compared to performing frame type selection for each sequence. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a unified contextual video compression framework (UCVC) that supports both P-frame and B-frame coding. The key ideas are:

1) Each non-intra frame refers to two neighboring decoded frames, which can be either from the past (P-frame) or one from the past and one from the future (B-frame).

2) Jointly optimize network parameters with both P-frame and B-frame coding during training. This allows the model to adapt to both frame types.

3) Perform frame type selection for each sequence during testing to achieve better compression efficiency. P-frame works better for sequences with large motions while B-frame is more efficient for slow and simple motions.

Main Contributions:

1) A unified video compression framework that supports both P-frame and B-frame coding, enabling flexible latency-efficiency trade-off.

2) A joint training strategy with both frame types, allowing the model to adapt to different frame coding modes.

3) Demonstrated the benefit of frame type selection in different motion scenarios and reported optimal compression efficiency by selecting the best frame type for each sequence.

4) Achieved comparable or better compression efficiency than state-of-the-art traditional and learned video compression methods on standard test datasets.

In summary, the proposed method provides a unified solution for video compression that can meet the requirements of different application scenarios by supporting multiple frame coding modes and frame type selection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a unified contextual video compression framework that supports both P-frame and B-frame coding and achieves optimal compression efficiency by selecting appropriate frame types for each video sequence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified contextual video compression framework (UCVC) that supports both P-frame and B-frame coding. Specifically:

- The framework takes two decoded frames as references, which can be either both from the past (P-frames) or one from the past and one from the future (B-frames). This allows flexible switching between P-frame and B-frame compression.

- The model parameters are jointly optimized with both P-frames and B-frames during training. This allows the framework to achieve comparable compression efficiency on both frame types. 

- By selecting the optimal frame type (P or B) for each sequence, the framework can achieve better overall compression efficiency compared to using only one frame type.

- Experimental results show the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior learned video compression methods, and is comparable to traditional video codecs like HEVC and VVC.

In summary, the main contribution is the unified framework that supports both P and B-frame coding, joint optimization strategy, and flexibility to select frame types per sequence for optimal efficiency.

The paper proposes a unified video compression framework that supports both P-frame coding (for low latency) and B-frame coding (for high efficiency). It extracts temporal contexts from multiple reference frames and fuses them for compression. The framework is trained end-to-end with both P-frames and B-frames to optimize rate-distortion performance. One key aspect is the flexibility to select frame types to achieve optimal compression efficiency for each sequence. This work is presented for the video compression track of the CLIC challenge at DCC 2024.
