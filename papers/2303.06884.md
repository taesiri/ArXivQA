# [SCPNet: Semantic Scene Completion on Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06884)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve the performance of semantic scene completion algorithms, especially for outdoor scenes where the input point cloud is sparse, incomplete, and contains objects at multiple scales as well as label noise from dynamic objects. 

Specifically, the paper proposes three key solutions:

1) Redesigning the completion sub-network to aggregate multi-scale features without lossy downsampling operations. This aims to improve completion quality for objects at different scales.

2) Distilling dense semantic knowledge from a multi-frame teacher model to a single-frame student model via a novel Dense-to-Sparse Knowledge Distillation (DSKD) objective. This transfers relational knowledge to combat sparsity and incompleteness. 

3) A completion label rectification strategy using panoptic segmentation to remove traces of dynamic objects in the completion labels, addressing inherent label noise.

The central hypothesis is that jointly addressing these three challenges (multi-scale objects, sparse/incomplete input, and label noise) through these solutions will significantly improve semantic scene completion performance on real-world outdoor LiDAR datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Redesigning the completion sub-network: The authors propose several key principles for building a strong completion sub-network, including maintaining sparsity, avoiding downsampling, and aggregating multi-scale features. They design a new completion sub-network based on these principles using Multi-Path Blocks.

2. Distilling knowledge from multi-frame model: The authors propose a Dense-to-Sparse Knowledge Distillation (DSKD) method to transfer dense, relation-based semantic knowledge from a multi-frame teacher model to a single-frame student model. This is the first work to apply knowledge distillation to semantic scene completion. 

3. Completion label rectification: The authors propose a simple strategy to use panoptic segmentation labels to remove traces of dynamic objects in the completion labels, making them more accurate for training completion models.

4. State-of-the-art results: The proposed SCPNet achieves 1st place on the SemanticKITTI completion benchmark, outperforming prior state-of-the-art by 7.2 mIoU. It also achieves strong performance on SemanticPOSS and SemanticKITTI semantic segmentation.

In summary, the key novelty is in the comprehensive redesign of the completion sub-network, the novel application of knowledge distillation to this task, and the completion label rectification strategy. Together, these contributions achieve new state-of-the-art results on semantic scene completion benchmarks.
