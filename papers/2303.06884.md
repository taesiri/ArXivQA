# [SCPNet: Semantic Scene Completion on Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06884)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve the performance of semantic scene completion algorithms, especially for outdoor scenes where the input point cloud is sparse, incomplete, and contains objects at multiple scales as well as label noise from dynamic objects. 

Specifically, the paper proposes three key solutions:

1) Redesigning the completion sub-network to aggregate multi-scale features without lossy downsampling operations. This aims to improve completion quality for objects at different scales.

2) Distilling dense semantic knowledge from a multi-frame teacher model to a single-frame student model via a novel Dense-to-Sparse Knowledge Distillation (DSKD) objective. This transfers relational knowledge to combat sparsity and incompleteness. 

3) A completion label rectification strategy using panoptic segmentation to remove traces of dynamic objects in the completion labels, addressing inherent label noise.

The central hypothesis is that jointly addressing these three challenges (multi-scale objects, sparse/incomplete input, and label noise) through these solutions will significantly improve semantic scene completion performance on real-world outdoor LiDAR datasets.
