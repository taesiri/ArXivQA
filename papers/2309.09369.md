# [Embrace Divergence for Richer Insights: A Multi-document Summarization   Benchmark and a Case Study on Summarizing Diverse Information from News   Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09369)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and goals of this paper appear to be:1) How proficient are large language models (LLMs) at summarizing diverse information from multiple news articles about an event? The paper aims to evaluate the performance of different LLMs on a new proposed task called Multi-document Diversity Summarization (MDDS).2) What are the pitfalls and best practices when using GPT-4 as an automatic evaluation metric for the MDDS task? The paper analyzes different protocols for using GPT-4 to evaluate summary faithfulness and coverage, looking at biases and correlation with human judgments.3) Do LLMs exhibit particular biases or coverage limitations when performing MDDS? The paper investigates the tendencies of different LLMs to summarize certain types of information over others based on article position, question type, and answer frequency. The overarching focus seems to be assessing the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for summarizing diverse information from multiple news sources, using both human and automatic evaluation. The new MDDS dataset and task are proposed as a rigorous benchmark, and analyses are conducted to provide recommendations for evaluation and gain insights into current LLM behavior on this challenging summarization task.
