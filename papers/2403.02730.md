## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world systems often have inherent constraints (e.g. conservation laws) that must be satisfied. 
- Existing techniques to incorporate constraints into neural networks like Neural ODEs have limitations:
    - Modified architectures are tailored to specific constraints, lacking versatility. 
    - Penalty methods require manual tuning of hyperparameters which is challenging.
- Lack of constraints in neural network models reduces interpretability and requires more training data.  

Proposed Solution:  
- A two-stage training method to incorporate constraints into Neural ODEs without penalty parameters.
- Reformulates constrained optimization problem into two unconstrained sub-problems solved sequentially. 
    - Stage 1 (Admissibility): Minimizes constraints violation to find feasible solution.
    - Stage 2 (Optimization): Minimizes loss function starting from feasible solution of Stage 1.  
- Employs "preference point" strategy in Stage 2 to ensure optimization remains in feasible region.

Main Contributions:
- Parameter-free method to incorporate constraints into Neural ODEs.
- Enhances model interpretability and convergence.
- Reduces data requirements by leveraging constraint knowledge.  
- Demonstrated superior performance over baseline Neural ODEs across various experiments.
- Established equivalence between original constrained problem and proposed two sub-problems.
- Detailed algorithm and comprehensive experimental analysis provided.  
- Introduced two new datasets designed specifically to evaluate the method.
- Discussed potential extensions beyond Neural ODEs to general neural network architectures.

In summary, the paper presents a novel two-stage training approach that explicitly handles constraints in Neural ODE models in an efficient and interpretable manner without relying on additional hyperparameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage training method for Neural ODEs to model constrained real-world systems by reformulating the constrained optimization problem into two sequential unconstrained sub-problems of finding feasible solutions and optimizing the loss function, while ensuring the optimization process satisfies constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage training method for Neural ODEs to effectively model constrained real-world systems. The key ideas are:

1) Reformulating the constrained optimization problem as two unconstrained sub-problems - an admissibility stage to find a feasible solution satisfying constraints, and an optimization stage to minimize the loss function.

2) Introducing a "preference point" strategy in the optimization stage to ensure the process stays within the feasible region by rejecting trial points with worse admissibility.  

3) Demonstrating through experiments that this approach improves predictive performance, converges faster, and enhances model interpretability compared to vanilla Neural ODEs and penalty methods.

4) Establishing mathematically that the constrained problem and the two sub-problems have equivalent optimal solutions.

5) Providing a detailed algorithm outlining the integration of the two-stage method into Neural ODE training.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel parameter-free method to effectively incorporate constraints into Neural ODEs for modeling real-world systems, with both theoretical justifications and experimental validations.
