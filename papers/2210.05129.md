# [Multi-Object Navigation with dynamically learned neural implicit   representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can neural implicit representations be used as effective inductive biases to support visual navigation and mapping in unknown environments? 

Specifically, the authors propose and evaluate two complementary neural implicit representations that are learned dynamically during agent deployment:

1) A "Semantic Finder" that predicts the position of a queried object of interest from its semantic code. This allows the agent to locate objects it has previously observed.

2) An "Occupancy and Exploration Implicit Representation" that encodes information about explored areas and obstacles. The authors introduce a novel global read mechanism to extract a useful summary embedding from this representation. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that equipping a navigation agent with these two learned implicit representations as inductive biases will improve its ability to build semantic, occupancy and exploration maps on-the-fly, thereby boosting navigation performance on tasks like Multi-Object Navigation that require locating multiple objects.

The key research contributions appear to be:

- Proposing the two implicit representations and demonstrating their benefits

- Introducing the global read mechanism to efficiently summarize the occupancy representation 

- Showing these representations can be learned fully dynamically, without any pre-training on the environment

- Analyzing design choices and providing extensive experimental evaluation

In summary, the central research question relates to using learned neural implicit representations as inductive biases to improve mapping and navigation in unknown environments. The main hypothesis is that the proposed representations will enhance agent capabilities on tasks requiring semantic, occupancy and exploration mapping.
