# [Generator-Guided Crowd Reaction Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting the reach/engagement of social media posts is challenging but valuable for digital marketers, content creators, etc. 
- Specifically, the paper introduces a novel task called Crowd Reaction Assessment (CReAM) - predicting if one tweet will receive more reactions than another tweet.

Solution - Generator-Guided Estimation Approach (GGEA):
- GGEA leverages the analytical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude etc. to guide classification models in making better predictions.
- It combines the reasoning ability of LLMs and state-of-the-art performance of classifiers.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new dataset called Crowd Reaction Estimation Dataset (CRED) containing pairs of tweets from White House twitter account with comparative retweet count labels.
- Proposes the GGEA framework that utilizes LLMs' analysis to guide classification models.
- Shows that fine-tuned FLANG-RoBERTa model with tweet text and Claude's responses performs the best, outperforming baseline models.
- Demonstrates GGEA's ability to assess paraphrrases of a tweet to help users optimize engagement.

Overall, the key novelty is using LLMs like Claude or ChatGPT to provide explanatory analysis on tweet pairs which is then fed to classifiers like FLANG-RoBERTa to guide them to make better predictions on tweet engagement, introducing the new CReAM task and CRED dataset in the process.
