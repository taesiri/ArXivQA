# [Towards Controllable Face Generation with Semantic Latent Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art results in image generation but lack controllability and ability to edit real images. This is especially problematic for human faces where precise control is needed.
- Existing semantic image synthesis (SIS) models allow control via semantic masks but GAN-based ones lack diversity and quality while diffusion-based SDM lacks ability to guide generation using reference images.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel latent diffusion model architecture called SCA-DM for controllable face generation and editing.
- Uses both SPADE normalization and cross-attention to merge shape from masks and style from reference images, enabling precise control.
- Modified mask-conditioned cross-attention proposed to improve disentanglement of face parts.
- Trained end-to-end with a style encoder to extract multiresolution style embeddings from reference images.

Main Contributions:
- First diffusion model for SIS that can both generate diverse samples and reproduce precise styles from references for editing.
- Novel combination of SPADE and cross-attention to fuse layout and style information.
- Modified cross-attention using masks to encourage disentanglement.  
- Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation showing superiority over GAN-based and diffusion-based state-of-the-art in reconstruction, style transfer, and controllable generation.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel latent diffusion model architecture for semantic face image synthesis that, for the first time, achieves both high-quality controllable generation guided by semantic masks and reference images as well as precise editing of real faces. This is enabled by a combination of SPADE and masked cross-attention.
