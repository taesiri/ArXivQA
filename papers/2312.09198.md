# [Weaving Pathways for Justice with GPT: LLM-driven automated drafting of   interactive legal applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using generative AI to help automate the creation of guided interviews that assist people in filling out complex legal forms. The traditional manual approach to building these interactive tools is time-consuming. The authors test three methods of automation using GPT-3 and GPT-4: 1) a fully automated conversational approach, 2) a constrained template-driven approach that generates draft questions for human review, and 3) a hybrid method. They conduct experiments with court forms using the open source Docassemble platform. The results show promise in using generative AI to reduce the human effort needed to author the first draft of these guided interviews. However, human review and editing remains essential to address limitations around complex logic and ensuring usability. The authors conclude that a hybrid human-in-the-loop approach, leveraging the strength of both humans and AI, is best suited for this document automation task. They propose integrating their experimental features into an existing guided interview authoring tool they created to fully realize the benefits.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Creating interactive legal applications to help self-represented litigants fill out court forms is slow and labor-intensive work. The traditional approach requires extensive human effort to manually label fields, write questions and prompts, group questions logically, and add conditional logic. This limits the number of forms that can feasibly be automated.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors experiment with using generative AI to automate parts of the interactive legal application creation process. They try three approaches:

1) Using GPT-3 to iteratively prompt the user to fill in the form fields.

2) Using GPT-4-turbo to generate draft questions and logic that are then reviewed by a human. 

3) A hybrid approach that combines automated drafting with human review and editing.

The experiments use the open-source Docassemble platform and integrate with an existing tool called the Assembly Line Weaver that helps automate part of the process.

Main Contributions:

- Show that generative AI can automatically label fields and draft basic questions/logic for both Word and PDF documents. This works fairly well for simpler documents.

- There are still limitations, especially with accurately placing checkboxes from PDFs into the text context. Additional engineering work could help address this.

- Fully automated AI-only approaches have downsides compared to integrating human review. Allowing flexible human intervention at different points balances automation with control.

- A hybrid approach is best - where humans review and edit an auto-generated draft guided interview. This can significantly reduce human effort compared to manual authoring.

- Even basic level 1 automation that just matches the PDF experience can expand access to justice by making forms mobile-friendly.

Conclusion:
Generative AI drafting combined with human editing of interviews is a promising approach to speed up the creation of tools to help self-represented litigants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes experiments with using generative AI to automate the creation of guided interviews that help users complete complex court forms, finding that a hybrid approach of machine-generated drafts combined with human review balances efficiency and quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a hybrid approach to automating the creation of interactive legal applications (guided interviews) that help people complete court forms and similar documents. 

Specifically, the key points are:

1) They evaluate using GPT-3 and GPT-4 to automatically label fields in Word documents and PDF forms. This shows promise but has some limitations.

2) For PDF forms, they show it's possible to automatically generate full draft Docassemble interviews in YAML format using a large language model, without any human intervention. This works fairly well for simple forms without much conditional logic.

3) They argue the best approach is to integrate the automated drafting with their existing template-driven Weaver tool. This allows flexible human review and editing at different points. 

4) The hybrid approach of humans reviewing and editing automatically generated draft interviews can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to author these tools, allowing more forms to benefit.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the potential of a hybrid approach to automated and human authoring of interactive legal applications, combining the strengths of generative AI and human judgment. Their experiments show this can expand access to document automation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords or key terms are:

- document automation
- generative AI
- large language models
- forms
- form automation
- guided interviews
- interactive legal applications

The abstract also lists these specific keywords:

- document automation 
- generative AI
- large language models
- forms  
- form automation
- guided interviews
- interactive legal applications

So in summary, the key terms relate to using AI and automation to create guided interviews and interactive tools to help with legal forms and court documents. The goal is to make these forms more accessible and usable, particularly for self-represented litigants.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three different approaches to automating the completion of court forms. Can you describe these approaches in more detail and discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of each?

2. The Assembly Line Weaver tool is used in all three experiments described. What specific capabilities does this tool provide and how does it facilitate the automation process?

3. The paper states that generative AI alone is not suitable for automating complex legal documents. Why is some level of human review and editing still essential? What are some of the risks if forms are automated without human oversight?

4. The hybrid approach combines automated drafting with human review. At what stages in the process would it be most valuable for humans to intervene? What types of errors or issues might they be looking to identify and correct?

5. The paper experimented with having the AI classify data types upfront during the parsing stage. What risks or downsides did this introduce? How could those risks be mitigated?

6. What was the core challenge in reliably identifying and labeling all fields, particularly checkboxes, when working with PDF documents? How successful were the attempted solutions?

7. How exactly would you integrate the DOCX and PDF automation capabilities together with the existing Assembly Line Weaver tool? What would be the advantages of this type of integration?

8. Can you walk through the full process that was used to automatically generate questions and a Docassemble interview from a provided PDF document? What were the key steps? 

9. The paper refers to a "level 1" guided interview. What capabilities would an interview at this level have compared to the original PDF? What further enhancements represent levels 2-4?

10. What opportunities exist for further research and engineering to improve the automated labeling of fields in PDF documents? What approaches seem most promising from the experiments discussed?
