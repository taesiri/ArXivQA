# [Weaving Pathways for Justice with GPT: LLM-driven automated drafting of   interactive legal applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using generative AI to help automate the creation of guided interviews that assist people in filling out complex legal forms. The traditional manual approach to building these interactive tools is time-consuming. The authors test three methods of automation using GPT-3 and GPT-4: 1) a fully automated conversational approach, 2) a constrained template-driven approach that generates draft questions for human review, and 3) a hybrid method. They conduct experiments with court forms using the open source Docassemble platform. The results show promise in using generative AI to reduce the human effort needed to author the first draft of these guided interviews. However, human review and editing remains essential to address limitations around complex logic and ensuring usability. The authors conclude that a hybrid human-in-the-loop approach, leveraging the strength of both humans and AI, is best suited for this document automation task. They propose integrating their experimental features into an existing guided interview authoring tool they created to fully realize the benefits.
