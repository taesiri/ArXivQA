# [L$^2$GC: Lorentzian Linear Graph Convolutional Networks For Node   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06064)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing linear graph convolutional network (GCN) models perform feature transformation in Euclidean space, which may cause distortions when dealing with real-world graph data that exhibits tree-like hierarchical structures. Although some nonlinear GCN models have been proposed for hyperbolic spaces to capture such hierarchical structures, they increase model complexity. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Lorentzian Linear Graph Convolutional Network (L2GC) that performs linear feature transformation in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical structures while maintaining simplicity. 

Key points:
- L2GC has three main steps - parameter-free neighborhood feature propagation in Euclidean space, Lorentzian linear feature transformation in hyperbolic space, and node label prediction back in Euclidean space.  
- For feature propagation, a personalized page rank scheme is used to balance graph structure and node features.
- For feature transformation, a novel Lorentzian linear transformation is defined to allow linear operations in hyperbolic geometry. This captures hierarchical structures better.
- Log and exp maps are used to move between tangent spaces and hyperbolic space.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to model linear GCN feature transformation in hyperbolic space using Lorentzian manifold
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on Citeseer and PubMed citation datasets
- Trains two orders of magnitude faster than nonlinear models on large dataset while using significantly fewer parameters
- Demonstrates superiority of hyperbolic geometry for tree-like structures and enhances linear GCN performance

In summary, the paper introduces a novel simplistic linear GCN approach in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical data structures, achieving simplicity, efficiency and new state-of-the-art results.
