# [What's the Plan? Evaluating and Developing Planning-Aware Techniques for   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Planning is an important capability for AI systems like web/embodied agents, but recent studies show large language models (LLMs) lack necessary planning skills. 
- Experiments reveal LLMs struggle to effectively model state changes from actions, identify applicable actions, and prioritize subgoals by necessity or optimality.
- These deficiencies highlight gaps in LLMs' planning and decision-making mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper advocates for a hybrid approach combining LLMs with classical planning techniques to address LLM limitations.
- They introduce SimPlan, a novel similarity-based planner using an action-ranking model and greedy best-first search (GBFS). 
- The action-ranking model scores action relevance based on state/goal similarity using late interaction and hard negatives. 
- GBFS explores high-potential paths unlike beam search's limited diversity.  
- Direct state updates from actions avoid LLM inference errors.

Contributions:
- Analysis of critical missing capabilities in LLMs for planning tasks.  
- Introduction of SimPlan, a new hybrid planner integrating classical planning algorithms/tools with LLMs.
- Proposal of a novel generalized planning setup with training on simple problems and testing on more complex ones.
- Demonstration of significant performance gains over prior hybrid and LLM-only methods across planning domains.
- The setup and model provide a platform to advance LLM-based planning.

In summary, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis of LLMs' deficiencies as planners, advocates the potential of hybrid methods, introduces the novel SimPlan planner, and shows substantial improvements in a challenging generalized planning setup across multiple planning domains.
