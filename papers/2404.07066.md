# [Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at   Different Layers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, but it remains unclear how and where they acquire conceptual knowledge within their neural networks. This paper introduces the notion of "concept depth" to measure the layer at which models understand different concepts.

- LLMs tend to efficiently classify simpler tasks, indicating shallow concept learning. More complex concepts require deeper layers to fully comprehend, if at all. This suggests a spectrum of conceptual complexity learned at different depths.

Methodology: 
- Concepts are categorized by factual, emotional, and inferential dimensions, with tasks of varying complexity under each. 9 datasets spanning these dimensions are used.  

- Representations are extracted from every layer of various LLMs and evaluated via linear classifier probes on the tasks to quantify conceptual understanding per layer.

Key Findings:
- Easy tasks see high accuracy initially, complex tasks only at deeper layers or not at all. This pattern persists across LLMs of differing sizes and families.

- Larger models grasp concepts better and earlier on. Converging points (peak comprehension) shift to shallower depths as model size grows.

- Same-sized models converge at varied depths, indicating diverse approaches to processing complexity despite similar scale.

- Noise and lower precision (below 16 bits) impede learning, shifting convergence deeper. This suggests deeper models have greater robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the notion of concept depth to capture layered acquisition of knowledge in LLMs.

- Extensive analysis quantifying and comparing concept depth across models and tasks.

- Demonstrates easy versus complex concept learning at different depths.

- Surface key factors impacting concept depth - model scale, family, noise, and precision.

The paper offers important insights into how conceptual knowledge emerges within large language models, paving the way for optimized model design.
