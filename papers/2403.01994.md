# [Vanilla Transformers are Transfer Capability Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01994)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformers have been gaining traction due to their ability to expand model capacity at lower computational cost. 
- However, studies show that MoE transformers underperform vanilla transformers in many downstream tasks, diminishing their practical value.

Proposed Solution - Transfer Capability Distillation (TCD):  
- The authors propose that a model's downstream performance depends on both its pre-training performance and its "transfer capability" - the ability to transfer pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks.
- Vanilla transformers have weaker pre-training performance but stronger inherent transfer capability compared to MoE transformers. 
- The authors introduce the concept of TCD - using vanilla transformers as "teachers" to distill transfer capability into MoE transformer "students", enhancing their downstream performance.

Key Contributions:
- Identify inferior transfer capability as the cause of poor downstream performance in MoE transformers compared to vanilla transformers.
- Introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, using weaker vanilla models to teach transfer capability to superior MoE models.
- Design a distillation scheme with relational constraints that demonstrably improves downstream performance of MoE models.
- Provide insights into differences in transfer capability from a model feature perspective and explain effectiveness of proposed distillation.

In experiments, TCD shows significant gains in GLUE scores for MoE BERT models, surpassing both the original MoE baseline and the vanilla teacher model. This supports TCD as an effective novel concept for enhancing transfer learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes transfer capability distillation to address the issue of Mixture-of-Experts transformers underperforming vanilla transformers in downstream tasks due to inferior transfer capability, by using vanilla models as teachers to enhance the transfer capability of Mixture-of-Experts models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Differentiating pre-training performance from transfer capability as distinct influencers of downstream performance, and identifying inferior transfer capability as the cause of poor downstream performance in MoE models.

2. Introducing the concept of transfer capability distillation, identifying vanilla transformers as effective teachers, and proposing a distillation scheme. 

3. Addressing the issue of weak transfer capability in MoE models through transfer capability distillation, thereby enhancing their downstream task performance.

4. Providing insights into the differences in transfer capability from a model feature perspective and offering a basic explanation of the mechanisms behind transfer capability distillation.

So in summary, the key contribution is introducing transfer capability distillation to enhance the downstream performance of MoE models by using vanilla transformers as teachers to improve their transfer capability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers - The paper focuses on enhancing the transfer capability and downstream performance of MoE transformer models.

- Transfer capability - A key concept proposed in the paper, referring to a model's inherent ability to transfer knowledge learned during pre-training to downstream tasks. The paper argues that MoE models have inferior transfer capability compared to vanilla transformers.

- Transfer capability distillation - The main idea proposed in the paper, which involves using vanilla transformers as teacher models to enhance the transfer capability of MoE student models.

- Pre-training performance - The performance of a model on pre-training objectives like masked language modeling. The paper differentiates this from transfer capability.

- Downstream performance - The performance of a model when fine-tuned on downstream tasks like those in the GLUE benchmark. Determined by both pre-training performance and transfer capability.

- Relation alignment - The method used to implement transfer capability distillation, involving aligning relationships between representations in the teacher and student models rather than their absolute values.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes that pre-training performance and transfer capability are two distinct factors influencing downstream performance. However, what is the theoretical basis for making this distinction between the two factors? Is there prior work supporting this?

2. The paper claims that the root cause behind Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models underperforming vanilla models is inferior transfer capability. However, have alternative explanations been fully ruled out, such as overfitting issues during fine-tuning? 

3. The core idea proposed is transfer capability distillation, with vanilla models acting as teachers. However, what factors determine the suitability of a model for playing the teacher role? Should the teacher necessarily have weaker pre-training performance?

4. In the distillation scheme, relation alignment is employed instead of value alignment of representations. What is the theoretical motivation behind opting for relation alignment? Are there any drawbacks to this approach?  

5. The distillation scheme aligns relations in three locations - model trunk, residual inner, and multi-head attention. Why were these specific locations chosen? What principles or insights guided this choice?

6. Experiments reveal adding constraints at the multi-head attention harms transfer capability for smaller models. What factors might explain this observation? Are there any mitigation strategies?  

7. To explain the efficacy of transfer capability distillation, feature quality is discussed. However, how is feature quality defined and quantified? What specific characteristics constitute high-quality features?

8. The explanation attributes differences in transfer capability to variations in feature quality learned during pre-training. However, how does this account for models having identical pre-training performance yet differing transfer capabilities?

9. Ablation analysis shows constraints at trunk and inner residual are critical for enhancing transfer capability. However, do both contribute equally? Is the relative importance context-dependent?

10. Trend analysis reveals the student model surpasses teacher model downstream performance after distillation. Does this outcome depend on the level of pre-training of the teacher model? Would over-training the teacher alter outcomes?
