# [Vanilla Transformers are Transfer Capability Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01994)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformers have been gaining traction due to their ability to expand model capacity at lower computational cost. 
- However, studies show that MoE transformers underperform vanilla transformers in many downstream tasks, diminishing their practical value.

Proposed Solution - Transfer Capability Distillation (TCD):  
- The authors propose that a model's downstream performance depends on both its pre-training performance and its "transfer capability" - the ability to transfer pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks.
- Vanilla transformers have weaker pre-training performance but stronger inherent transfer capability compared to MoE transformers. 
- The authors introduce the concept of TCD - using vanilla transformers as "teachers" to distill transfer capability into MoE transformer "students", enhancing their downstream performance.

Key Contributions:
- Identify inferior transfer capability as the cause of poor downstream performance in MoE transformers compared to vanilla transformers.
- Introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, using weaker vanilla models to teach transfer capability to superior MoE models.
- Design a distillation scheme with relational constraints that demonstrably improves downstream performance of MoE models.
- Provide insights into differences in transfer capability from a model feature perspective and explain effectiveness of proposed distillation.

In experiments, TCD shows significant gains in GLUE scores for MoE BERT models, surpassing both the original MoE baseline and the vanilla teacher model. This supports TCD as an effective novel concept for enhancing transfer learning.
