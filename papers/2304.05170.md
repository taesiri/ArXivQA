# [SportsMOT: A Large Multi-Object Tracking Dataset in Multiple Sports   Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05170)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve multi-object tracking performance in sports scenes. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a multi-object tracking method that can handle the unique challenges present in sports videos, such as fast and variable speed motions of players as well as their similar appearances. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Existing MOT datasets and methods are not optimized for sports scenes, which exhibit faster and more complex motions compared to regular pedestrian tracking scenarios. 

2) Sports players have relatively similar appearances with subtle distinguishing features like jersey numbers and postures. This requires the tracker to develop more discriminative and extensive appearance representations.

3) A tracking framework that integrates specialized motion modeling and robust appearance-based association can achieve improved performance on sports MOT.

To test these hypotheses, the paper introduces a new large-scale sports MOT dataset called SportsMOT. It also proposes a new tracking method called MixSort that combines motion-based association using a Kalman filter with appearance-based matching using a MixFormer module. Experiments demonstrate improved tracking accuracy on SportsMOT dataset compared to other state-of-the-art trackers.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop optimized MOT algorithms for sports scenes by addressing the unique motion and appearance challenges. The key hypotheses focus on creating a sports-specific benchmark and a tracking framework that integrates motion and appearance cues in a robust and specialized way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing SportsMOT, a new large-scale multi-object tracking dataset in diverse sports scenes. SportsMOT contains 240 videos with over 150K frames and 1.6M bounding boxes. It has two key properties - fast and variable-speed motion, and similar yet distinguishable appearance.

2. Benchmarking several state-of-the-art trackers on SportsMOT. The results reveal that the main challenge lies in object association rather than detection. 

3. Proposing a new tracking framework called MixSort, which introduces a MixFormer-like structure to enhance appearance-based association in prevailing trackers. Experiments show MixSort boosts performance on both SportsMOT and MOT17.

4. Conducting extensive experiments and analysis to provide insights into SportsMOT. For example, comparing results on different sports categories reveals basketball is most difficult due to more occlusion and blur. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of fusing motion and appearance cues for tracking in sports scenes.

In summary, the main contribution is creating a new tracking benchmark for sports analysis and proposing a tracking framework to address the key challenges. The experiments and analysis also provide valuable insights into tracking in sports scenes.
