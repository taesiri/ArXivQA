# [Decomposed Prompting: Unveiling Multilingual Linguistic Structure   Knowledge in English-Centric Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, though primarily trained on English data, have shown remarkable cross-lingual capabilities. But it is unclear if this multilinguality stems from deep linguistic knowledge or just superficial pattern matching. 
- Existing methods to probe multilingual knowledge in sequence labeling tasks have limitations - behavioral probes struggle with complex structures, text-to-text prompts lack output control.
- A recent iterative prompting method is slow due to dependence of each prediction on previous ones.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a "decomposed prompting" method to probe linguistic structure understanding of LLMs by transforming a sequence labeling task into focused prompts for each token.
- For an input sentence, prompts are generated asking for the linguistic label of each token. The model then predicts labels independently.

Experiments and Results:
- Evaluated decomposed prompting for part-of-speech tagging in 38 languages using English-centric (LLaMA, Mistral) and multilingual (BLOOMZ, mT5) LLMs.
- Decomposed prompting outperforms iterative prompting baseline in both zero-shot and few-shot settings in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
- Analysis reveals impact of evaluation method (probability vs generation based) and task instructions on performance.
- English-centric LLMs achieve higher average scores than multilingual models, but multilingual models show better performance on distant languages.

Key Contributions:
- Introduced an effective prompting strategy to probe linguistic structure knowledge in LLMs, outperforming prior approaches.
- Provided analysis contrasting capabilities of English-centric vs multilingual LLMs.
- Showed English-centric LLMs harbor substantial multilingual knowledge, giving insights into their cross-lingual transferability.

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper - the problem being addressed, the proposed decomposed prompting solution, experiments demonstrating its advantages, and an analysis of findings regarding multilinguality of different LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a decomposed prompting approach to probe the multilingual linguistic structure understanding of English-centric large language models by generating individual prompts for each token asking for its part-of-speech tag, finding that this method outperforms iterative prompting baselines and provides insights into the models' cross-lingual transfer capabilities for sequence labeling tasks across 38 languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new prompting method called "decomposed prompting" for probing the multilingual linguistic structure knowledge in English-centric large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) It proposes the decomposed prompting approach which splits an input sentence into tokens and generates an individual prompt for each token to inquire about its linguistic label, transforming sequence labeling into a series of focused prompts.

2) It evaluates decomposed prompting on Universal Dependencies part-of-speech tagging datasets across 38 languages, comparing it to an iterative prompting baseline. The results show decomposed prompting achieves better accuracy and efficiency.

3) Analysis reveals the nuanced impact of evaluation methods and prompt instructions on the performance of decomposed prompting. 

4) It provides an investigation and insights into the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs compared to multilingual LLMs, contributing to the understanding of their cross-lingual transferability.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating the novel decomposed prompting method to unveil and analyze the multilingual linguistic structure knowledge stored in predominant English-centric LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Decomposed prompting - The proposed method to probe multilingual linguistic structure knowledge in English-centric large language models by generating individual prompts for each token asking for its linguistic label. 

- Sequence labeling - Framed as tagging tasks to evaluate linguistic structure understanding, such as part-of-speech tagging.

- Multilingual prompting - Evaluating language models on tasks in languages other than English by providing an English description and examples along with inputs in the target language. 

- English-centric large language models - Language models like GPT-3 and LLaMA that are primarily trained on English data but still show cross-lingual capabilities.

- Multilingual linguistic knowledge - The paper investigates whether the cross-lingual ability stems from deep multilingual understanding or just surface pattern matching.

- Iterative prompting - The baseline method that iteratively predicts each token's label based on the full context including previous labels.

- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting - Experimental scenarios evaluated where models receive only an English description or also a few English demonstrations respectively. 

- Probability-based vs generation-based evaluation - Ways to evaluate the model outputs, either based on the predicted label probabilities or the generated label text.

The key focus is understanding and evaluating the multilingual linguistic knowledge in predominately English-trained language models through the decomposed prompting strategy.

3. The paper argues decomposed prompting is more efficient than iterative prompting. What factors contribute to the faster inference? How much speedup was achieved in experiments?

4. The formulation defines a prompt template function T(). What considerations went into the design of this function? How was it adapted for providing demonstrations?

5. What findings from the ablation study reveal insights into the nuances of evaluation methods and the role of instructions? How do these factors impact performance?

6. In analyzing individual language performance, what key attributes, like linguistic proximity to English and script type, seem to influence cross-lingual transferability? 

7. What theory does the paper propose to explain the better average performance of English-centric models compared to multilingual models? Do you agree?

8. What challenges highlighted in the case study analysis remain unresolved in the current implementation of decomposed prompting? How can the approach evolve?  

9. What practical implications does this research have in guiding the selection criteria for foundation models to fulfill multilingual requirements?

10. The paper focuses only on part-of-speech tagging. What other linguistic tasks could decomposed prompting be applied to as future work to probe multilingual knowledge?
