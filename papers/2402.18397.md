# [Decomposed Prompting: Unveiling Multilingual Linguistic Structure   Knowledge in English-Centric Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, though primarily trained on English data, have shown remarkable cross-lingual capabilities. But it is unclear if this multilinguality stems from deep linguistic knowledge or just superficial pattern matching. 
- Existing methods to probe multilingual knowledge in sequence labeling tasks have limitations - behavioral probes struggle with complex structures, text-to-text prompts lack output control.
- A recent iterative prompting method is slow due to dependence of each prediction on previous ones.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a "decomposed prompting" method to probe linguistic structure understanding of LLMs by transforming a sequence labeling task into focused prompts for each token.
- For an input sentence, prompts are generated asking for the linguistic label of each token. The model then predicts labels independently.

Experiments and Results:
- Evaluated decomposed prompting for part-of-speech tagging in 38 languages using English-centric (LLaMA, Mistral) and multilingual (BLOOMZ, mT5) LLMs.
- Decomposed prompting outperforms iterative prompting baseline in both zero-shot and few-shot settings in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
- Analysis reveals impact of evaluation method (probability vs generation based) and task instructions on performance.
- English-centric LLMs achieve higher average scores than multilingual models, but multilingual models show better performance on distant languages.

Key Contributions:
- Introduced an effective prompting strategy to probe linguistic structure knowledge in LLMs, outperforming prior approaches.
- Provided analysis contrasting capabilities of English-centric vs multilingual LLMs.
- Showed English-centric LLMs harbor substantial multilingual knowledge, giving insights into their cross-lingual transferability.

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper - the problem being addressed, the proposed decomposed prompting solution, experiments demonstrating its advantages, and an analysis of findings regarding multilinguality of different LLMs.
