# [Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2724v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. How can we formulate canonical correlation analysis (CCA) in a sparse convex framework to learn sparse projections that maximize correlation between two views?

2. Can sparse CCA with a primal-dual formulation, where one view uses a primal representation and the other a dual (kernel) representation, effectively learn semantic relationships between different languages in a bilingual corpus? 

3. Will sparse CCA outperform kernel CCA when the number of original features is large, by learning the semantic space from a small set of relevant features?

The paper proposes a new sparse CCA method to address the first question, formulated as a convex least squares problem with L1 regularization to induce sparsity. 

It then applies this method to bilingual text data to evaluate the second and third hypotheses, comparing performance to kernel CCA. The results suggest sparse CCA can effectively learn semantic relationships from small feature sets and outperforms kernel CCA when the original feature space is very high-dimensional.

In summary, the main focus is developing and evaluating a new sparse optimization framework for CCA to learn interpretable low-dimensional projections.
