# [ViVid-1-to-3: Novel View Synthesis with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01305)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating novel views of objects from a single image is an important problem in computer vision. It requires understanding the 3D structure of an object from a 2D image and rendering high-quality, spatially consistent new views from desired camera poses. Recent diffusion model-based methods can generate high-quality images but often lack consistency in terms of both content and viewing angle. Making them more consistent requires costly retraining or combining them with 3D methods, which can hurt image quality.

Method: 
The key idea is to formulate novel view synthesis as generating a video where the camera moves around the object from the input view to the target view. This allows leveraging powerful priors from pre-trained video diffusion models to improve consistency without any training. 

Specifically, the method:
1) Creates a smooth camera path from input to target view using spherical linear interpolation
2) Initializes latents for each frame and denoises them using both a view-conditioned diffusion model (Zero-1-to-3 XL) and a video diffusion model (ZeroScope)
3) Linearly reduces the video diffusion model's influence over time to prevent over-smoothing

The combined guidance from both models results in novel views that are more consistent in content and viewing angle compared to using only the view-conditioned model.

Contributions:
- Shows how video diffusion can improve novel view synthesis from single images without any training
- Proposes a simple and effective way to combine view-conditioned and video diffusion models 
- Introduces a new optical flow based metric to better evaluate consistency
- Outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, especially as target view deviates more from the input

The method provides significantly improved consistency while retaining competitive image quality by exploiting video diffusion as a strong prior. It demonstrates the promise of leveraging pre-trained models in complementary ways without costly training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a strikingly simple yet effective method for consistent novel view synthesis by posing it as a video generation task and combining pre-trained novel view and video diffusion models without any training or fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a strikingly simple yet effective method for improving the consistency of novel view synthesis from diffusion models. The key idea is to leverage video diffusion models as strong priors by framing novel view synthesis as generating a video of different views of an object. This allows combining a pre-trained novel view diffusion model and video diffusion model to get more consistent novel views without any training or fine-tuning. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate improved consistency over state-of-the-art methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Novel view synthesis - The paper focuses on generating new views of objects from a single input image. This is referred to as novel view synthesis.

- Diffusion models - The method leverages diffusion models, specifically latent diffusion models, for novel view synthesis. Both view-conditioned and video diffusion models are used.

- Consistency - A key focus and contribution of the paper is improving the consistency of novel views generated by diffusion models in terms of viewing angle and content. 

- Video diffusion - A core idea in the paper is using video diffusion models to improve consistency in novel view synthesis. Video generation is posed as an auxiliary task.

- Denoising - The diffusion models rely on a denoising process to reverse the diffused signal and generate images. The denoising strategy combines view and video diffusion models.

- Optical flow metric - A novel evaluation metric based on optical flow is proposed to better measure consistency compared to standard image metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

- Training-free - An advantage of the method is that it improves consistency without requiring new training or fine-tuning of models.

In summary, the key focus is on improving consistency in novel view synthesis from diffusion models by incorporating video diffusion in a training-free manner, measured with appropriate optical flow based metrics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key idea of the proposed method is to leverage video diffusion models as strong priors for novel view synthesis. Why are video diffusion models suitable as priors in this context compared to other options like image diffusion models? What specific properties do they have that make them effective?

2. The paper proposes generating a smooth camera trajectory and denoising using both a view-conditioned diffusion model and a video diffusion model. What is the intuition behind combining the noise estimates from both models in this way? How do the two models complement each other?  

3. The method schedules the influence of the video diffusion model using linear decay of the $\lambda_{video}$ hyperparameter. What is the effect of having too much or too little influence from the video model? Why is the scheduling important?

4. How does posing novel view synthesis as video generation help improve consistency compared to directly generating each novel view independently? What specific consistency improvements result from this approach?

5. The proposed optical flow based metric measures spatial deviations to account for minor misalignments. Why do standard metrics like PSNR, SSIM etc fall short in evaluating novel view synthesis? What properties make the proposed metric more suitable?

6. The method does not require any new training or fine-tuning. What are the practical benefits of a training-free approach? How does it compare to methods involving retraining diffusion models for consistency?

7. The paper combines 2D novel view synthesis with video priors. How can this approach complement other works involving 3D representations and geometries? What are some promising future directions?

8. What are some potential limitations of the proposed approach? When might directly generating each view independently work better compared to posing it as video generation?

9. How suitable is the method for high resolution novel view synthesis? What adaptations might be required to scale it beyond 256x256 images shown in the paper?

10. The method shows text-to-novel view synthesis results. What advancements make the overall pipeline capable of this? How do the semantic preservation capabilities compare to other generative models?
