# [Meta-survey on outlier and anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07101)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper conducts the first systematic meta-survey on general survey papers related to outlier and anomaly detection published over the past 20 years. Through a rigorous paper collection and selection methodology, it identifies 25 high-quality surveys on the topic. The analysis reveals a lack of proper methodology in most surveys, significant instances of plagiarism, and provides insights into the historical development and knowledge consolidation within the field. Consensus emerges on several aspects, including refined definitions and categorizations of anomalies, challenges induced by high-dimensionality, the utility of anomaly scores, and the rising prominence of deep learning methods. However, disagreements persist regarding notions like local versus global outliers and the construction of meaningful taxonomies for detection algorithms. Overall, the meta-survey elucidates the evolution of this extensive literature, highlighting impactful surveys while uncovering endemic methodological and ethical issues. It concludes by emphasizing open research questions and providing oriented reading recommendations for both domain newcomers and experts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper conducts the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection, analyzing 25 high-quality papers over a 20-year period to investigate the evolution of the field, areas of consensus regarding key concepts like taxonomy and dimensionality issues, and topics of continued debate like defining local vs global outliers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection. Its main contributions are:

1) It collects and analyzes a comprehensive set of nearly 500 survey papers on outlier/anomaly detection using a rigorous systematic survey methodology. This set is further refined to a curated collection of 25 high-quality surveys after careful quality assessment.

2) It investigates the evolution of the outlier detection field over a 20-year period by analyzing these surveys, revealing emerging themes and methods as well as differences in survey writing practices across scholarly communities. 

3) It delves into several topics where consensus has emerged, including taxonomies of outlier types, the impact of high dimensionality, the importance of anomaly scores, challenges in learning conditions and benchmarking, and the rising significance of neural networks.

4) It also discusses non-consensual aspects on debated topics like the distinction between local and global outliers and difficulties in organizing detection methods into meaningful taxonomies.

In summary, this meta-survey provides insights into the historical development, knowledge consolidation, and areas of disagreement in the field of outlier and anomaly detection by systematically analyzing high-quality surveys on the topic.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Meta-survey - The paper conducts a systematic meta-survey, focusing specifically on surveys and review papers on anomaly and outlier detection.

- Systematic methodology - The meta-survey follows a rigorous, systematic methodology for paper collection, selection, and analysis. This includes search queries, snowball sampling, quality assessment, etc.

- Historical evolution - The meta-survey looks at how the field has evolved over a 20-year period, including emerging themes and methods.

- Consensual findings - The paper discusses areas of consensus that have emerged from the literature over time, such as definitions, taxonomies, issues with high-dimensional data, importance of anomaly scores, etc. 

- Debated aspects - The paper also delves into non-consensual, debated topics like the distinction between local and global outliers and challenges in organizing methods into taxonomies.

- Neural networks - The prevalence and evolution of neural network models, from early shallow networks to contemporary deep learning, is analyzed.

- Survey methodology - The paper is critical of the lack of systematic methodologies and possible bias in many existing surveys. It advocates for more rigor.

In summary, key terms cover the meta-survey approach, historical analysis, areas of agreement and disagreement, neural networks, and proper survey methodology.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims to implement the "first systematic meta-survey" on anomaly and outlier detection surveys. What makes this a systematic meta-survey compared to previous meta-analyses or reviews of reviews on this topic? How does following a systematic review protocol enhance the reliability and comprehensiveness of the findings?

2. The initial search queries seem quite simplistic, using just combinations of "outlier", "anomaly", "survey", and "review". What evidence suggests that these queries provided extensive coverage of the relevant literature? Could additional relevant papers have been missed due to this search strategy? 

3. The criteria for exclusion of non-general surveys seems quite subjective. For example, why were papers on high dimensional data considered "general enough" but not papers on time series data or graphs? What principles guided these inclusion/exclusion criteria? Could this introduce bias into the selected literature?

4. The quality assessment phase uncovered several instances of plagiarism as well as surveys that lacked significant contributions. What specific criteria were used to evaluate paper quality on these dimensions? Are there any validation results showing the reliability of these quality assessments? 

5. The selected surveys exhibit very little overlap in their proposed taxonomies for categorizing outlier detection methods. In the authors' views, why have researchers struggled to agree on meaningful taxonomies? What alternative approaches could improve taxonomy consensus?

6. The discussion contrasts the enduring relevance of taxonomies based on outlier types/data characteristics versus the transient value of summary-based surveys. Is this a false dichotomy? Could certain summary-based surveys provide lasting value under some conditions?

7. Several major issues like high dimensionality and anomaly scoring are absent or under-discussed in most surveys. Is this due to inherent limitations of the survey format? If so, what alternatives might better synthesize key issues in outlier detection? 

8. The prevalence of neural network methods persists across the review timeline. To what extent could this reflect publication biases rather than genuine popularity? How does the advent of deep learning affect the interpretability of findings on neural network prevalence?

9. The distinction between local versus global outliers remains contentious. What are the core points of disagreement underlying this debate? Are scholars differing on technical details or more foundational concepts of locality?

10. What future directions for meta-survey research could enhance understandings of outlier detection? For example, are additional quality checks warranted to assess literature gaps or biases? How frequently should meta-surveys be updated to track an evolving research domain?
