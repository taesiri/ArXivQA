# [Meta-survey on outlier and anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07101)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper conducts the first systematic meta-survey on general survey papers related to outlier and anomaly detection published over the past 20 years. Through a rigorous paper collection and selection methodology, it identifies 25 high-quality surveys on the topic. The analysis reveals a lack of proper methodology in most surveys, significant instances of plagiarism, and provides insights into the historical development and knowledge consolidation within the field. Consensus emerges on several aspects, including refined definitions and categorizations of anomalies, challenges induced by high-dimensionality, the utility of anomaly scores, and the rising prominence of deep learning methods. However, disagreements persist regarding notions like local versus global outliers and the construction of meaningful taxonomies for detection algorithms. Overall, the meta-survey elucidates the evolution of this extensive literature, highlighting impactful surveys while uncovering endemic methodological and ethical issues. It concludes by emphasizing open research questions and providing oriented reading recommendations for both domain newcomers and experts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper conducts the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection, analyzing 25 high-quality papers over a 20-year period to investigate the evolution of the field, areas of consensus regarding key concepts like taxonomy and dimensionality issues, and topics of continued debate like defining local vs global outliers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection. Its main contributions are:

1) It collects and analyzes a comprehensive set of nearly 500 survey papers on outlier/anomaly detection using a rigorous systematic survey methodology. This set is further refined to a curated collection of 25 high-quality surveys after careful quality assessment.

2) It investigates the evolution of the outlier detection field over a 20-year period by analyzing these surveys, revealing emerging themes and methods as well as differences in survey writing practices across scholarly communities. 

3) It delves into several topics where consensus has emerged, including taxonomies of outlier types, the impact of high dimensionality, the importance of anomaly scores, challenges in learning conditions and benchmarking, and the rising significance of neural networks.

4) It also discusses non-consensual aspects on debated topics like the distinction between local and global outliers and difficulties in organizing detection methods into meaningful taxonomies.

In summary, this meta-survey provides insights into the historical development, knowledge consolidation, and areas of disagreement in the field of outlier and anomaly detection by systematically analyzing high-quality surveys on the topic.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims to implement the "first systematic meta-survey" on anomaly and outlier detection surveys. What makes this a systematic meta-survey compared to previous meta-analyses or reviews of reviews on this topic? How does following a systematic review protocol enhance the reliability and comprehensiveness of the findings?

2. The initial search queries seem quite simplistic, using just combinations of "outlier", "anomaly", "survey", and "review". What evidence suggests that these queries provided extensive coverage of the relevant literature? Could additional relevant papers have been missed due to this search strategy? 

3. The criteria for exclusion of non-general surveys seems quite subjective. For example, why were papers on high dimensional data considered "general enough" but not papers on time series data or graphs? What principles guided these inclusion/exclusion criteria? Could this introduce bias into the selected literature?

4. The quality assessment phase uncovered several instances of plagiarism as well as surveys that lacked significant contributions. What specific criteria were used to evaluate paper quality on these dimensions? Are there any validation results showing the reliability of these quality assessments? 

5. The selected surveys exhibit very little overlap in their proposed taxonomies for categorizing outlier detection methods. In the authors' views, why have researchers struggled to agree on meaningful taxonomies? What alternative approaches could improve taxonomy consensus?

6. The discussion contrasts the enduring relevance of taxonomies based on outlier types/data characteristics versus the transient value of summary-based surveys. Is this a false dichotomy? Could certain summary-based surveys provide lasting value under some conditions?

7. Several major issues like high dimensionality and anomaly scoring are absent or under-discussed in most surveys. Is this due to inherent limitations of the survey format? If so, what alternatives might better synthesize key issues in outlier detection? 

8. The prevalence of neural network methods persists across the review timeline. To what extent could this reflect publication biases rather than genuine popularity? How does the advent of deep learning affect the interpretability of findings on neural network prevalence?

9. The distinction between local versus global outliers remains contentious. What are the core points of disagreement underlying this debate? Are scholars differing on technical details or more foundational concepts of locality?

10. What future directions for meta-survey research could enhance understandings of outlier detection? For example, are additional quality checks warranted to assess literature gaps or biases? How frequently should meta-surveys be updated to track an evolving research domain?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents a systematic meta-survey on general survey papers related to outlier and anomaly detection published over the past 20 years. The goal is to provide insights into the historical development and evolution of knowledge in this field, identify areas of agreement and disagreement, and give recommendations for reading.

The authors first describe their systematic paper collection methodology, using specialized search engines and a "snowballing" technique to identify an initial set of 56 survey papers claiming to be general reviews of outlier/anomaly detection. After a thorough quality assessment to eliminate papers with plagiarism or limited contribution, 25 high-quality survey papers are selected.

The paper finds that most surveys lack an explicit paper collection methodology, which risks biasing results. Taxonomies for categorizing methods also tend to be arbitrary. More useful surveys move beyond cataloging methods to address bigger issues like high dimensionality, anomaly scoring, learning conditions, and neural networks. 

Analyzing this curated collection of surveys, consensus emerges around defining outliers/anomalies, challenges of high dimensionality, the importance of anomaly scores, predominance of unsupervised learning, and the staying power of neural networks (especially deep learning recently).

There is less agreement on distinguishing local vs global outliers and creating meaningful taxonomies of methods. The paper recommends key surveys to read for unified perspectives and thorough coverage of major issues. It also identifies open questions around benchmarking, interpretability, and visualization.

In conclusion, while outlier/anomaly detection is an extensive field, the number of surveys making significant, lasting contributions is smaller than it appears. Consolidation of knowledge happens around anomaly definitions, key challenges like dimensionality, and neural networks, but taxonomies and local/global distinctions remain areas of debate calling for further analysis.
