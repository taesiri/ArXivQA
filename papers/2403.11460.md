# [Fed3DGS: Scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting with Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing city-scale 3D reconstruction methods typically use a centralized approach where all data is gathered on a central server for scene reconstruction. This places heavy load on the server and requires extensive data storage, limiting scalability beyond city-scale. In addition, continuously updating the model to reflect scene changes is challenging. 

Proposed Solution - Fed3DGS:
The paper proposes Fed3DGS, a federated learning framework for scalable 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). It distributes computation and data across many client devices to leverage their computational resources.

Key aspects:
- Uses 3DGS scene representation which is more efficient than voxel-based methods in terms of model size
- Proposes distillation-based model update scheme tailored for 3DGS to merge local models into global model
- Introduces appearance modeling into 3DGS to handle non-IID data from different clients/seasons

Contributions:
1) Proposes first federated learning framework for 3DGS scene reconstruction that is more scalable
2) Designs distillation-based update protocol specific to properties of 3DGS representation
3) Introduces appearance modeling to handle seasonal/client variations in federated reconstruction 
4) Demonstrates comparable image quality to centralized approaches on several datasets
5) Shows ability to reflect scene changes and model appearance changes over seasons

Limitations: 
Does not address common federated learning challenges like limited client computation capabilities. Assumes accurate global pose estimation. Appearance modeling can still be improved in quality. Handling pixels with infinite depth is also a remaining challenge.
