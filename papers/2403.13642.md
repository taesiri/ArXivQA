# [H-vmunet: High-order Vision Mamba UNet for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies while vision transformers (ViTs) have low sensitivity to local features and high computational complexity. Recently proposed state-space models (SSMs) like 2D-selective-scan (SS2D) show promise but still introduce redundant information.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) that introduces higher-order interactions into SS2D to reduce redundant information while retaining global context. 

Specifically, they propose:

1) High-order 2D-selective-scan (H-SS2D) that progressively reduces redundant information over orders of interaction while keeping global context.  

2) High-order visual state space (H-VSS) module with H-SS2D as the core that replaces standard self-attention.

3) Local-SS2D module to improve learning of local features.

4) H-vmunet architecture combining H-VSS modules with UNet shape for medical image segmentation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of H-SS2D to reduce redundant information for SS2D via higher-order interactions

- H-VSS module incorporating proposed H-SS2D  

- Local-SS2D module to improve local feature learning

- H-vmunet architecture combining H-VSS with UNet that introduces higher-order interactions to state-space models

- Experiments on 3 medical image datasets demonstrating superiority over CNN, ViT and standard SSM-based models, and a 67.28% decrease in parameters over standard Vision Mamba UNet.
