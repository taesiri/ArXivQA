# [H-vmunet: High-order Vision Mamba UNet for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies while vision transformers (ViTs) have low sensitivity to local features and high computational complexity. Recently proposed state-space models (SSMs) like 2D-selective-scan (SS2D) show promise but still introduce redundant information.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) that introduces higher-order interactions into SS2D to reduce redundant information while retaining global context. 

Specifically, they propose:

1) High-order 2D-selective-scan (H-SS2D) that progressively reduces redundant information over orders of interaction while keeping global context.  

2) High-order visual state space (H-VSS) module with H-SS2D as the core that replaces standard self-attention.

3) Local-SS2D module to improve learning of local features.

4) H-vmunet architecture combining H-VSS modules with UNet shape for medical image segmentation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of H-SS2D to reduce redundant information for SS2D via higher-order interactions

- H-VSS module incorporating proposed H-SS2D  

- Local-SS2D module to improve local feature learning

- H-vmunet architecture combining H-VSS with UNet that introduces higher-order interactions to state-space models

- Experiments on 3 medical image datasets demonstrating superiority over CNN, ViT and standard SSM-based models, and a 67.28% decrease in parameters over standard Vision Mamba UNet.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) for medical image segmentation, which introduces Vision Mamba into higher order operations to efficiently capture both global context and local features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes the following main contributions:

1. It proposes a High-order 2D-selective-scan (H-SS2D) operation based on the state-space model (SSM). The higher-order operation helps minimize the introduction of redundant information while maintaining the excellent global receptive field of SS2D. 

2. It constructs a High-order visual state space (H-VSS) module with the proposed H-SS2D as the core component, to replace the conventional visual state space (VSS) module.

3. It develops a High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) model by incorporating the proposed H-VSS module into a UNet architecture, for medical image segmentation tasks. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first model to introduce Vision Mamba operations to higher order processing of visual features.

4. Experiments on three public medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed H-vmunet achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art methods including higher-order spatial interaction models and Vision Mamba models, while using 67.28% fewer parameters than pure Vision Mamba UNet.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of H-SS2D and H-VSS to enable more efficient higher-order processing in Vision Mamba models, as well as the development of the H-vmunet architecture that leverages these modules to advance medical image segmentation.
