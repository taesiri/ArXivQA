# [Towards Unsupervised Question Answering System with Multi-level   Summarization for Legal Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Legal text reasoning is complex even for state-of-the-art language models. SemEval-2024 Task 5 aims to assess reasoning ability of models on legal questions related to US civil procedure.

Proposed Solution: 
- Employ segment-wise summarization of lengthy explanations using T5 to retain crucial information.  
- Explore both supervised (multi-level CNN fusion with BiGRU/BiLSTM) and unsupervised (similarity metrics on various embeddings) approaches.
- For unsupervised, compute similarity between question-answer and answer-summary pairs using combinations like Glove-cosine, transformer embeddings-cosine/euclidean, word2vec-cosine.
- Refine unsupervised model by replacing top prediction with second best if similarity difference is small.

Key Results:
- Best supervised model achieved 66% and 49.6% macro F1 on dev and test sets.  
- Best unsupervised model (Word2vec-cosine) achieved 62% and 52.3%, outperforming baseline.
- Replacement in unsupervised model improved performance significantly.
- Models consistently perform better on dev set compared to test set, indicating generalization issues.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of segment-wise summarization using T5 on lengthy legal explanations to retain key details.
- Comprehensive analysis of supervised vs unsupervised approaches on complex legal QA dataset. 
- Demonstrated unsupervised similarity-based model with prediction replacement can outperform supervised models.
- Thorough evaluation illuminates model generalization issues from dev to test set.

Future Work: 
- Ensemble supervised and unsupervised models to create unified "super model".
- Use siamese networks to better learn similarities for unsupervised model.
