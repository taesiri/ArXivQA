# [Spatial Decomposition and Temporal Fusion based Inter Prediction for   Learned Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate inter prediction is critical for video compression performance. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate inter prediction for local video regions with inconsistent motion and occlusion. Traditional video codecs use techniques like recursive partitions, geometric partitions, and long-term references to handle motion inconsistency and occlusion. However, existing learned video codecs focus on minimizing the overall prediction error while ignoring local motion inconsistency and occlusion.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a spatial decomposition and temporal fusion based inter prediction for learned video compression to handle motion inconsistency and occlusion.

For motion inconsistency: 
1) A structure and detail decomposition (SDD) based motion model is proposed. Video frames are decomposed into structure (low-freq) and detail (high-freq) components. 
2) Motion vectors are estimated separately for structure and detail components to capture consistent motions and additional inconsistent differences.
3) SDD-based temporal context mining is performed to generate more accurate short-term contexts.

For occlusion:
1) A convolutional LSTM is used to accumulate long-term temporal information from historical references. 
2) The long-term contexts are fused with short-term contexts to provide supplementary predictions when short-term contexts fail due to occlusion.

Main Contributions:
1) An SDD-based motion model to handle motion inconsistency by estimating motions separately for structure and detail components.
2) Long-short term temporal context fusion using ConvLSTM based long-term contexts to handle occlusion.
3) The proposed codec with spatial decomposition and temporal fusion outperforms H.266/VVC and prior learned codecs on common datasets for both PSNR and MS-SSIM.

In summary, this paper effectively handles motion inconsistency and occlusion in learned video compression using spatial decomposition and long-short term temporal fusion to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The core ideas are decomposing frames and modeling motions separately, and fusing both short and long term temporal contexts.

To handle motion inconsistency and occlusion for more accurate inter prediction in learned video compression, this paper proposes a spatial decomposition and temporal fusion approach involving structure and detail decomposition-based motion modeling and long short-term temporal context fusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A spatial decomposition and temporal fusion based inter prediction is proposed for learned video compression to handle motion inconsistency and occlusion. 

2. For motion inconsistency, a structure and detail decomposition (SDD)-based motion model is proposed, which performs SDD-based motion estimation and SDD-based temporal context mining for the structure and detail components respectively.

3. For occlusion, the paper proposes to propagate long-term temporal contexts by recurrently accumulating the temporal information of each historical reference feature and fuse them with short-term temporal contexts. 

4. With the proposed spatial decomposition and temporal fusion based inter prediction, the proposed learned video codec outperforms the reference software of H.266/VVC on all common test datasets for both PSNR and MS-SSIM.

In summary, the key innovations are using spatial decomposition and temporal fusion to improve inter prediction in learned video compression, which leads to state-of-the-art compression performance surpassing the latest video coding standard H.266/VVC.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a structure and detail decomposition (SDD)-based motion model. What is the intuition behind decomposing a frame into structure and detail components and estimating motion separately on them? How does this help handle motion inconsistency in local regions?

2. The paper uses downsampling and upsampling operations to extract structure components from frames. What other techniques could be explored to decompose frames into structure and detail? How may they impact performance? 

3. The paper proposes SDD-based temporal context mining where motion compensation is done separately on structure and detail components using their corresponding motion vectors. How does this process of generating temporal contexts differ from prior arts? What are the advantages?

4. The paper introduces a ConvLSTM-based long-term temporal context generation module. Why is ConvLSTM well-suited for this task over other sequence modeling techniques? What modifications can be made to the module design to potentially improve performance? 

5. What other recurrent network architectures can be explored for long-term temporal context generation? How may they differ in terms of modeling capacity and computational complexity?

6. The long-term and short-term contexts are hierarchically fused before being passed to the contextual encoder-decoder. What are other possible fusion techniques that can be analyzed? What may be their tradeoffs?

7. The paper uses a cascaded training loss to reduce error propagation. Analyze the impact of sequence length and loss weighting strategies on model performance.  

8. The motion vectors are compressed via a motion autoencoder. What recent advancements in learned image compression can be incorporated into the motion autoencoder? How may they impact overall performance?

9. Analyze the rate-distortion performance of the model under different configurations of GOP size. How does increasing GOP size impact the relative contribution of the SDD and long-term modeling components?

10. The runtime benchmarks show minimal increase despite introducing new components. What are the main bottlenecks for further reducing encoding and decoding time? How can model optimization and quantization techniques help?
