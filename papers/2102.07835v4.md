## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is how to improve graph neural networks (GNNs) by incorporating topological information about the graphs. The key hypothesis is that augmenting GNNs with topological features will enhance their ability to learn from graph-structured data, especially when the topological structure itself contains information relevant for the task. Specifically, the paper proposes a new topological graph layer (TOGL) that can capture multi-scale topological features of graphs based on persistent homology. The hypothesis is that integrating TOGL into existing GNN architectures will make them "topology aware" and improve their expressive power and predictive performance on tasks where topology matters. The paper empirically evaluates this hypothesis on both synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks.In summary, the key research question is: Can augmenting GNNs with a topological layer improve their ability to learn from graph data where topology is informative? The main hypothesis is that a layer like TOGL will increase the expressive power of GNNs and lead to better performance when topology matters. The paper presents TOGL and empirically tests this hypothesis.
