# [Latent variable model for high-dimensional point process with structured   missingness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05758)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Longitudinal data (repeated measurements over time) are important in many fields but have several challenges: high-dimensionality, structured missingness patterns, and time points come from an unknown stochastic process rather than being fixed.
- Existing methods address some but not all of these challenges. They lack the flexibility to jointly model complex missingness, leverage information from the temporal point process, and scale to large datasets. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose two latent variable models based on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian processes (GPs) to address all these challenges.

- The first model (LLSM) captures structured missingness patterns by having separate latent variables for the data and missingness masks. GP priors capture temporal correlations.  

- The second model (LLPPSM) additionally models the time points as coming from a temporal point process. The inferred intensity of this process provides extra information to the GP kernels.

Main Contributions:
- A VAE-GP model for longitudinal data that can capture structured missingness patterns. Models data and missingness masks through separate latent variables.

- An extension of this model (LLPPSM) that also treats time as a random process and leverages the stochastic intensity to inform the GP kernels. Captures more subtle temporal effects.

- Demonstrates strong performance on imputation and prediction tasks on both simulated and real healthcare data. Handles complex missingness and provides state-of-the-art results.

- Provides an efficient amortized variational inference scheme that scales training to large datasets by using inducing points and stochastic optimization.

In summary, the key novelty is a flexible VAE-GP model tailored to key properties of complex real-world longitudinal datasets - namely high-dimensionality, structured missingness, and stochastic time processes. The proposed LLPPSM model jointly addresses all these challenges and shows strong empirical performance.
