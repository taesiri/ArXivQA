# [WiMANS: A Benchmark Dataset for WiFi-based Multi-user Activity Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- WiFi-based human sensing has shown promise for analyzing user behaviors non-intrusively. However, most works focus on single-user sensing, while multi-user sensing is more practical yet challenging.  
- Existing WiFi sensing datasets only contain single-user samples, lacking multi-user data to enable research on simultaneous multi-user sensing.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present WiMANS, the first dataset for WiFi-based multi-user activity sensing. 
- WiMANS contains 11286 samples with 0-5 users per sample performing 9 daily activities in 3 environments.
- Each 3-second sample has raw/preprocessed WiFi CSI data (3000 time steps) across dual bands (2.4GHz/5GHz) and synchronized 90-frame videos.

Main Contributions:
- WiMANS collects multi-user samples monitoring simultaneous activities of multiple users based on WiFi CSI and videos.
- Rich annotations are provided, including user identities, locations, activities, to support various sensing tasks.  
- Extensive benchmarks are conducted for state-of-the-art WiFi/video models regarding multi-user identification, localization and activity recognition.
- WiMANS can push boundaries from single-user to more practical multi-user WiFi sensing.

In summary, WiMANS is the first multi-user dataset to facilitate WiFi-based simultaneous human sensing, with dual-band CSI data, synchronized videos and comprehensive annotations. Benchmark experiments demonstrate feasibility and challenges for future multi-user sensing research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 WiMANS is the first WiFi-based multi-user activity sensing dataset containing dual-band CSI and synchronized videos for over 9 hours from 6 users performing 9 daily activities in 3 environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) It constructs the first WiFi-based multi-user activity sensing dataset (WiMANS) where each sample monitors simultaneous activities of multiple users. To the authors' knowledge, WiMANS is the first dataset that collects dual-band WiFi CSI and videos for multiple users in each sample.

2) WiMANS provides fine-grained annotations of user identities, locations, and activities to support various sensing tasks. The videos in WiMANS can further act as a reference for unexplored tasks like pose estimation. 

3) Benchmark experiments have been conducted on WiMANS to analyze the multi-user sensing performance of WiFi-based models and video-based models. This work provides the first benchmarks for WiFi-based multi-user identification, localization, and activity recognition.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of WiMANS as the first multi-user dataset to facilitate and benchmark WiFi-based human sensing research.
