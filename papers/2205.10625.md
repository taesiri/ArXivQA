# [Least-to-Most Prompting Enables Complex Reasoning in Large Language
  Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10625)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is:

How can complex reasoning skills be taught to large language models using only a small number of demonstration examples, without any training or fine-tuning? 

More specifically, the paper investigates an approach called "least-to-most prompting" for enabling language models to generalize to problems more difficult than those provided in the prompts. The key ideas are:

1) Breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems

2) Solving the subproblems sequentially, with answers to earlier subproblems facilitating solutions to later ones

3) Implementing both the decomposition and solving steps via prompting, without any model training

The paper hypothesizes that least-to-most prompting will outperform other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting in terms of easy-to-hard generalization. Experiments on symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning tasks are conducted to test this hypothesis.

In summary, the central research question is how to design effective prompting strategies to teach complex reasoning skills to large pre-trained language models using very few examples, with a focus on generalization to more difficult problems. Least-to-most prompting is proposed and evaluated as a promising approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a novel prompting strategy called "least-to-most prompting" to enable large language models to solve problems that are more complex than the examples provided in the prompts. 

The key ideas of least-to-most prompting are:

1) Breaking down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems.

2) Solving each subproblem sequentially, where solving one subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. 

Both the decomposition and solving stages are implemented via prompting, without any model training or fine-tuning.

The authors demonstrate that least-to-most prompting enables models like GPT-3 to achieve strong performance on tasks involving symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning, even generalizing to test cases more difficult than the prompt examples. 

A key result is that with just 14 examples, GPT-3 can solve the full SCAN benchmark using least-to-most prompting, reaching over 99% accuracy on all splits. This is notable since prior specialized models for SCAN are trained on the full dataset of over 15,000 examples.

Overall, the paper proposes a novel prompting strategy to improve generalization and shows its effectiveness on various reasoning tasks. The idea of breaking down problems and leveraging solutions to simpler subproblems seems to be the main technical contribution.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I would compare it to other research in the same field:

- The paper focuses on using a novel prompting strategy called "least-to-most prompting" to enable complex reasoning and generalization in large language models. This is an interesting new direction compared to much prior work on reasoning and generalization which has focused more on specialized model architectures or training techniques.

- The key idea of breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems that can be solved sequentially is quite different from other techniques like chain-of-thought prompting. This approach seems well suited for tackling tasks requiring compositional generalization or multi-step reasoning beyond the complexity of the examples.

- The paper provides empirical validation of their approach on several reasoning tasks, including symbolic manipulation, SCAN, and math word problems. The results demonstrate strong performance, such as near perfect accuracy on SCAN using just 14 examples. This is impressive compared to prior work that requires full dataset training of specialized models.

- The paper situates least-to-most prompting in the broader landscape of prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency decoding. It discusses how least-to-most builds on these methods but tackles a different set of challenges related to easy-to-hard generalization.

- Overall, I would say this paper introduces a novel prompting strategy and provides promising initial results suggesting it can enable complex reasoning in large language models. The approach seems differentiated from prior methods and tackles an important open problem in this field. More extensive evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks would help further establish its capabilities.

In summary, the paper proposes an interesting new prompting-based technique for reasoning and generalization, providing validation on some tasks. It differs from prior approaches and addresses the open problem of easy-to-hard generalization in an innovative way. More extensive evaluation across diverse tasks would help solidify its contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring how least-to-most prompting could be applied to other challenging tasks like commonsense reasoning, where problem decomposition may not be as straightforward as in the tasks studied in the paper. The authors mention that their approach may not generalize well across domains without designing new prompts.

- Developing methods to automate or assist with the problem decomposition step in least-to-most prompting. The decomposition currently relies fully on human demonstration examples.

- Evolving prompting into more interactive conversations to facilitate more efficient teaching and learning. The authors mention that prompting is inherently unidirectional without feedback, so two-way interaction could be beneficial.

- Combining least-to-most prompting with other techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency to achieve even better performance on complex reasoning tasks.

- Applying least-to-most prompting to other large language models beyond GPT-3 to analyze the impact on different model architectures.

- Developing better methods for few-shot evaluation of language models on complex reasoning tasks.

In summary, the main directions involve extending least-to-most prompting to other tasks and models, automating/improving the decomposition step, evolving prompting into interactions, and combining least-to-most with other techniques for reasoning. Evaluating these models also requires further work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompting strategy called "least-to-most prompting" to enable large language models to generalize to solving problems that are more difficult than the examples provided in the prompts. The key idea is to decompose a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems, and then sequentially solve each subproblem using the answers from previous subproblems. For example, a math word problem can be broken down into intermediate questions about calculating values for each step. Experiments on symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization using the SCAN benchmark, and math word reasoning tasks demonstrate that least-to-most prompting significantly improves generalization over chain-of-thought prompting. On SCAN, the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model achieves 99.7% accuracy using just 14 examples with least-to-most prompting, compared to only 16% with chain-of-thought prompting. The results indicate that least-to-most prompting enables teaching language models to incrementally build solutions by leveraging previously solved simpler subproblems.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompting strategy called "least-to-most prompting" to enable language models to solve problems that are more complex than the examples provided in the prompts. The key idea is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them sequentially. This is implemented in two stages - problem decomposition and subproblem solving. In the decomposition stage, the language model is prompted with examples to decompose a problem into simpler subproblems. In the subproblem solving stage, the language model is prompted to sequentially solve the subproblems, with each subproblem building on the answers from previous subproblems. Both stages use few-shot prompting without any training or fine-tuning. Experiments on symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning tasks show that least-to-most prompting enables better generalization to more difficult problems compared to standard prompting methods. A key result is that the GPT-3 model combined with least-to-most prompting can solve the SCAN benchmark with 99.7% accuracy using just 14 examples, compared to only 16% with standard prompting.
