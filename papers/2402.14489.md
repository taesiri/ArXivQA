# [A Class of Topological Pseudodistances for Fast Comparison of   Persistence Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Comparing persistence diagrams (PDs) is important for topological data analysis but computing metrics like Wasserstein distances between PDs is computationally expensive. 
- Simpler vectorization methods like Persistence Statistics (PS) are faster but less accurate and discriminative.
- There is a need for intermediate PD comparison metrics that balance computational complexity and accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new class of Extended Topological Pseudodistances (ETDs) between PDs that allows tunable complexity.
- ETDs project PDs onto multiple 1D directions, compute 1D Wasserstein distances between projections, and sum them. More projections increases accuracy but complexity.
- With few projections, ETDs are close to PS metrics. With many projections, they approximate sliced Wasserstein distances.
- So ETDs allow interpolating between fast PS-type metrics and slower but more accurate sliced Wasserstein metrics.

Main Contributions:
- Definition and computation cost analysis of the ETD metric with tunable complexity
- Theoretical comparison showing ETDs are richer than PS metrics and can approximate sliced Wasserstein in the limit
- Experiments showing ETDs outperform PS metrics in accuracy and outperform Wasserstein/sliced Wasserstein in computation time
- Framework to theoretically relate ETDs to sliced Wasserstein distances and PS metrics
- Evidence that even with few projections, ETD accuracy loss is minimal compared to Wasserstein distances

In summary, the paper proposes Extended Topological Pseudodistances as a new PD comparison metric that balances computational complexity and accuracy via a tunable number of projections. Experiments and theory show ETDs interpolate between fast vectorization-based metrics and slower but more accurate Wasserstein-type metrics for PDs.
