# [Mipha: A Comprehensive Overhaul of Multimodal Assistant with Small   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities but their widespread use is hindered by high computational demands during training and inference. This restricts their accessibility to a limited audience. 
- The paper investigates how to develop multimodal small language models (MSLMs) with fewer than 3 billion parameters that can rival the performance of larger 7B+ parameter MLLMs.

Methodology:
- The paper thoroughly analyzes 3 key components of MSLM design: language models, visual representations, and optimization strategies. 
- Several findings emerge that diverge from conventional wisdom on MLLMs, such as: 
    - Increasing image resolution is not always beneficial for MSLMs. 
    - Finetuning visual backbone and language model together improves MSLMs, unlike for MLLMs.
    - Instruction tuning via supervised finetuning or reinforcement learning is not essential for strong MSLM performance.
- Integrating these insights, the paper develops a series of MSLMs called Mipha scaled from 1.7B to 3B parameters.

Results: 
- Without additional training data, Mipha-3B outperforms SOTA open-source MLLMs like LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen-VL-7B, InstructBLIP-7B on multiple benchmarks.
- Remarkably, Mipha-3B also exceeds some 13B model counterparts, showcasing the capabilities attainable by compact yet carefully designed MSLMs.  

Main Contributions:
- Thorough analysis of MSLM design space, identifying findings that diverge from conventional MLLM insights
- Development of Mipha models establishing new benchmarks for <3B parameter MSLMs  
- Demonstration that carefully designed MSLMs can match or exceed larger 7B+ MLLMs on various benchmarks

The paper provides practical insights into optimizing MSLM performance, showing compelling capabilities are attainable even with fewer than 3 billion parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an in-depth analysis of design aspects of Multimodal Small Language Models, leading to the development of Mipha, a novel model suite that achieves state-of-the-art performance among small models and is competitive with larger counterparts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It offers a detailed examination of the design landscape for Multimodal Small Language Models, exploring visual components, language models, and optimization strategies from a comprehensive perspective. The empirical research provides findings that contrast with prior studies on Multimodal Large Language Models.

2. By integrating the empirical discoveries, the paper unveils a new series of Multimodal Small Language Models named Mipha, scaled from 1.7B to 3B parameters. This shows the practical impact of the research findings. 

3. The paper shows that the flagship model Mipha-3B outperforms existing 7B and 13B models on various benchmarks without requiring additional training data. This establishes a new benchmark for multimodal models with fewer than 3 billion parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is a thorough analysis of what makes an effective Multimodal Small Language Model, leading to the proposal of the Mipha series of models that can match or exceed much larger models with fewer parameters and training data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that increasing image resolution is not always beneficial for the performance of Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs). What might be some reasons that higher image resolution does not always translate to better performance? Are there certain model architectures or tasks where higher resolution is more impactful?

2. The authors find that fine-tuning the visual backbone can enhance MSLM performance across benchmarks, contrasting with some prior work on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Why might fine-tuning the vision model be more beneficial for MSLMs compared to MLLMs? 

3. When comparing base language models (LMs) versus instruct-tuned LMs like those finetuned with RLHF, the paper finds minimal quantitative difference in many cases. However, the qualitative responses from RLHF-tuned LMs seem more human-like. What factors may contribute to this disparity between quantitative and qualitative assessments?

4. How does the choice of pre-trained vision model, such as between CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 etc., influence downstream multimodal performance? Are certain model characteristics or training objectives more suitable for MSLMs?

5. The proposed Mipha models utilize the SigLIP visual backbone. What motivated this design choice over other options like CLIP? Does the SigLIP model offer advantages specific to the MSLM context?

6. For the Mipha models, what drove the decision to use 384px image resolution? How was this resolution selection optimized for efficiency versus retaining visual detail?

7. The paper advocates for fully fine-tuning vision and language components of MSLMs. What challenges arise when tuning all parameters, and how does the training process need to be adapted?

8. How does the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) tuning method compare to full-parameter tuning? In what cases might LoRA be preferable or not advisable?

9. The Mipha models utilize the Phi-2 language model. Why was Phi-2 chosen over other small LMs like Pythia or StableLM? What LM characteristics made it optimal?

10. Compared to leading Multimodal Large Language Models, where does Mipha excel or demonstrate weaknesses? What future improvements to MSLMs could enhance performance?
