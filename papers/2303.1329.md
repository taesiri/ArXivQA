# [Isotopic effects in molecular attosecond photoelectron interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.1329)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, it seems this paper investigates isotopic effects in molecular attosecond photoelectron interferometry by comparing measurements on methane (CH4) and deuteromethane (CD4). The central hypothesis appears to be that attosecond photoelectron interferometry is sensitive to isotopic substitution, which can be observed through modifications of the amplitude and contrast of oscillations in the photoelectron spectra. The authors aim to interpret these effects by considering differences in the nuclear autocorrelation functions and vibrational ground states of the two molecules.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Performing coincidence spectroscopy of an isotopic mixture of methane (CH4) and deuteromethane (CD4) using an attosecond pulse train and infrared laser pulses. This allows them to isolate and compare the photoelectron spectra from each isotope.2. Observing an isotopic effect in the amplitude and contrast of photoelectron sideband oscillations in two-color (XUV + IR) photoionization. Specifically, the sideband oscillations have higher contrast for CD4 compared to CH4. 3. Interpreting the isotopic effect using the nuclear autocorrelation functions and vibrational distributions of the two molecules. The differences arise from the faster nuclear dynamics in CH4+ compared to CD4+ after ionization by the XUV pulse. 4. Showing through modeling that the isotopic difference in sideband oscillations can be explained by considering both electronic and nuclear contributions. The electronic part enhances the oscillation amplitude for CH4 while the nuclear part suppresses it, resulting in the observed higher contrast for CD4.5. Demonstrating that nuclear motion can significantly influence attosecond photoelectron interferometry measurements in molecules, especially when there is ultrafast coupled electron-nuclear dynamics initiated by ionization.In summary, this paper reveals isotopic effects in two-color molecular photoionization through coincidence spectroscopy measurements and provides an interpretation based on electron-nuclear dynamics and theoretical modeling. The results showcase the sensitivity of attosecond spectroscopy to nuclear motion.
