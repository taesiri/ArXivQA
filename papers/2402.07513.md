# [The Balancing Act: Unmasking and Alleviating ASR Biases in Portuguese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is limited research quantifying biases in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for non-English languages. 
- Recent multilingual ASR systems like Whisper and Multilingual Massive Speech (MMS) achieve state-of-the-art performance but need further analysis regarding biases.
- Specifically for Portuguese language, there is no prior work analyzing these multilingual ASR systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a comprehensive study analyzing Whisper and MMS ASR systems on Portuguese language using the Casual Conversation Dataset (CCD V2).
- Examine biases across categories like gender, age, skin tone color, geo-location using standard ASR metrics and statistical tests.  
- Handle class imbalance by exploring data resampling techniques like SMOTE.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing disparities in Whisper and MMS ASR systems focused on Portuguese language.  
- Show importance of balanced data distribution for sub-categories using oversampling.
- Compare Whisper ASR variants to show impact of model parameters on performance.
- Analyze inter-racial biases using additional criteria like skin-tone scale and geo-location besides just gender and age.
- Empirically demonstrate that oversampling alleviates some performance differences between subgroups.

In summary, this pioneering study analyzes multilingual state-of-the-art ASR systems for biases on Portuguese language using diverse categories. It highlights the need for balanced subgroup data and shows oversampling helps mitigate disparities. The analysis also compares the robustness of the ASR systems regarding model parameters.
