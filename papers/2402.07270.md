# [Open-ended VQA benchmarking of Vision-Language models by exploiting   Classification datasets and their semantic hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Evaluating large vision-language models (VLMs) that can generate free-form text given an image is challenging due to: (1) difficulty in semantically comparing text expressions, (2) ambiguity in questions that allow multiple valid answers, and (3) lack of granular evaluation on model strengths and limitations beyond a single accuracy metric.

Proposed Solutions: 
(1) Transform classification datasets into VQA format to create fine-grained sub-benchmarks for objects, actions and attributes. Compared to existing VQA datasets focused on coarse concepts, this allows more targeted assessment.  
(2) Resolve ambiguity by cropping the image to guide the model and asking automatically generated follow-up questions based on concept hierarchies to obtain the expected level of specificity.
(3) Compare traditional NLP metrics to LLM-based metrics using human judgments as gold standard. Simple containment works well for short answers.

Main Contributions:
(1) Framework to convert classification datasets into VQA tasks with reduced ambiguity.
(2) Hierarchical follow-up questions to handle ambiguity and enhance answer precision.  
(3) New VQA sub-benchmarks for detailed model diagnosis on objects, actions and attributes.
(4) Analysis showing generic pre-trained models are better for fine-grained concepts while VQA-specialized models are better for coarse concepts and on existing VQA datasets.
(5) Simple text containment metric works best for automated evaluation given the short ground truth answers, while LLM-based metrics approach human performance.

In summary, the paper advances VQA evaluation by enabling detailed assessment, comparing different types of VLMs, and analyzing suitable automatic metrics approaching human judgements. This lays the foundation for targeted future progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces an open-ended visual question answering benchmark to evaluate text-generative vision-language models by transforming classification datasets into QA format, using label hierarchies and follow-up questions to reduce ambiguity, and comparing metrics to select appropriate evaluation criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel open-ended visual question answering (VQA) benchmark by transforming classification datasets into a VQA format. This allows granular evaluation of text-generative vision-language models on tasks like object, attribute, and activity classification.

2) Introducing a follow-up question procedure using concept hierarchies to reduce ambiguity in questions and guide models to provide responses with the appropriate level of detail expected by the ground truth labels. 

3) Comparing various automatic evaluation metrics like Exact Match, Contains, ClipMatch, and metrics based on language models, with human judgments as a gold standard. This analysis informs the choice of suitable metrics for evaluating model predictions on VQA tasks.

4) Evaluating several state-of-the-art vision-language models on the proposed benchmarks and providing an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses in answering different types of open-ended questions about images.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous framework and methodology for evaluating text-generative vision-language models through precision VQA grounded in classification datasets and label hierarchies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using existing image classification datasets to generate open-ended VQA datasets automatically. What are some potential issues with using this approach compared to manually created VQA datasets? How could the automatically generated datasets be further improved?

2. The paper introduces a follow-up question mechanism to reduce ambiguity and guide models to a more fine-grained answer. How is the parent concept for the follow-up question selected? What are some limitations of this approach? 

3. The paper evaluates several metrics like Exact Match, Contains Match, ClipMatch etc. What are the key differences between these metrics and what are their strengths and weaknesses in evaluating open-ended VQA?

4. The human evaluation study compares several automatic evaluation metrics to human judgment. Why do metrics like BLEURT, BertScore etc. not outperform simple text similarity metrics? What changes could improve their correlation with human judgment?

5. The paper finds that models pretrained on large generic datasets perform better on fine-grained object and activity classification compared to VQA-finetuned models. What factors contribute to this behavior? How can VQA-finetuned models be improved?

6. Qualitative analysis reveals certain weaknesses like the ClipMatch metric still producing suboptimal similarities in some cases. What enhancements could be made to the semantic similarity assessment to improve the match quality? 

7. The benchmark is currently limited to classification domains like objects, activities and attributes. How could it be extended to incorporate more complex reasoning capabilities? What new question types could be added?

8. The paper does not finetune the vision-language models on the proposed benchmarks. How would finetuning impact the results? Would the relative strengths/weaknesses of models remain the same?

9. The paper focuses on analyzing model capabilities through the lens of nouns, verbs and adjectives. Could analyzing model predictions along other linguistic dimensions provide additional insights?

10. The proposed benchmark methodology depends heavily on existing datasets and taxonomies. How well would this approach transfer to other domains where such resources are unavailable? What alternatives could be explored?
