# [Mafin: Enhancing Black-Box Embeddings with Model Augmented Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12177)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on embedding models to convert text into vector representations for semantic matching between queries and documents. However, pre-trained embedding models often have suboptimal performance when applied to domain-specific data. 
- Directly fine-tuning state-of-the-art black box embedding models is infeasible since their parameters are not exposed. This limits their customization for specific domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Model Augmented Fine-tuning (Mafin) which enhances black box embedding models by augmenting them with a small trainable embedding model. 
- Mafin concatenates the output embeddings from the black box model and the small trainable model. This adds representational capacity for domain adaptation while benefiting from the large-scale pre-trained black box model.
- For supervised fine-tuning with query-document relevance labels, Mafin is trained with a probabilistic ranking loss. For unsupervised training, queries are generated using a language model conditioned on documents.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework, Mafin, to fine-tune black box embedding models by augmenting them with a small trainable model tailored to the domain.
- Efficient supervised and unsupervised training strategies which enable effective adaptation even with limited domain data.  
- Experiments on two text retrieval datasets demonstrate significant gains over fine-tuning a standard model, with over 5% improvement across metrics like Recall and NDCG.
- Analysis showing Mafin outperforms other strategies like concatenation or linear transformation of embeddings.
- Overall, an effective and practical solution to enhance black box models for domain-specific retrieval tasks underlying RAG systems.
