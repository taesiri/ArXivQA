# [ERD: A Framework for Improving LLM Reasoning for Cognitive Distortion   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Improving accessibility of psychotherapy using large language models (LLMs) to detect cognitive distortions is an active area of research. However, existing methods like Diagnosis-of-Thought (DoT) tend to overdiagnose distortions even when user statements are benign. 
- DoT also has poor multi-class distortion classification performance close to random guessing.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes Extraction-Reasoning-Debate (ERD), a new framework to improve LLM-based distortion classification. 
- Extraction step uses LLM to extract parts of user utterances potentially exhibiting distortions, without paraphrasing. This preserves nuances for subsequent analysis.
- Reasoning step uses existing LLM reasoning methods like DoT to output thought process for assessing distortions. 
- Debate step uses multi-agent LLM debate to discuss initial assessment and make final decision. One LLM presents arguments for/against distortions based on extraction & reasoning outputs. Second LLM provides counterarguments over 2 rounds. Third LLM (judge) summarizes debate and evaluates validity of claims before final decision.

Main Contributions:
- ERD improves multi-class F1 score for distortion classification by over 9% over DoT.
- It increases distortion assessment specificity score by over 25% compared to DoT, correctly avoiding overdiagnosis.  
- Analysis shows extraction and debate steps in ERD drive these improvements.
- Multiple debate rounds and judge's summarization/validity evaluation are beneficial for ERD's performance.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in improving LLM reasoning for psychotherapy by introducing complementary extraction and debate steps to enhance classification accuracy and avoid distortion overdiagnosis.
