# [AutoNumerics-Zero: Automated Discovery of State-of-the-Art Mathematical   Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Computers approximate transcendental functions (e.g. exponential, trigonometric) using a sequence of basic arithmetic operations. These approximation methods were developed by mathematicians emphasizing arbitrary precision. 
- However, computers operate on limited precision types like 32-bit floats. When targeting a specific precision, existing approximation methods can be suboptimal.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an evolutionary algorithm called AutoNumerics-Zero (AutoNum) that automatically discovers mathematical functions optimizing the tradeoff between precision and efficiency for a given hardware and precision goal.

- AutoNum uses a two level search:
   - Outer loop does discrete optimization to evolve the symbolic structure of programs using genetic programming. Programs are represented as computational graphs.
   - Inner loop does continuous optimization to find optimal coefficients for a given program structure using CMA-ES.

- Objectives optimized:
   - For real-valued functions, maximize precision for a given number of field operations 
   - For float-valued functions, maximize precision while minimizing execution time on target hardware-compiler setup

Key Contributions:

- AutoNum discovers novel real-valued exponential approximations that are orders of magnitude more precise than the best mathematical baselines for a given number of field operations

- For float-valued exponential on Skylake CPU and XLA compiler, AutoNum finds programs 3x faster than baselines with same precision, by manipulating the compiler's internal heuristics

- The method seems to extend to other transcendental functions like logarithms and the error function

- AutoNum searches directly at practical input sizes without needing mathematical insight. This ability to optimize end-to-end could help automate efficient numerical code generation.

In summary, the paper shows how large-scale evolutionary search can surpass human-derived mathematical approximations when targeting efficiency at a specific precision and hardware, demonstrating a promising direction for automating efficient code generation.
