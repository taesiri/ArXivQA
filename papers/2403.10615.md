# [LightIt: Illumination Modeling and Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10615)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent diffusion models for text-guided image generation lack control over lighting, which is crucial for photo-realistic image synthesis.
- Obtaining paired lighting datasets from the real-world is challenging.
- Existing methods for explicit lighting control are limited.

Method:
- Propose a single-view shading estimation method to generate lighting datasets from images. Uses a density field to trace shadows and estimate direct shading.
- Generate a large dataset of image and shading pairs using outdoor panoramas. Automatically predict captions, depth, normals etc.
- Develop a lighting conditioning module for diffusion models using the estimated shading and normals. Uses a residual control encoder-decoder architecture.
- Additionally demonstrate identity-preserving relighting using the dataset to generalize better to real images.

Main Contributions:
- Lighting estimation method to obtain shading maps with cast shadows for arbitrary light directions.
- Paired image and shading dataset enabling lighting control.
- Controllable image generation method with coherent and consistent lighting.
- Relighting module that leverages diffusion prior for better real image quality.

In summary, the paper proposes a method and dataset to add explicit lighting control to text-guided diffusion models. It also shows an application to relighting while preserving identity and realism. The core ideas are shading estimation, control conditioning and utilizing diffusion priors.
