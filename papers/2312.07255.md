# [GIST: Improving Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning via Knowledge   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07255)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel fine-tuning framework called GIST to enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for pre-trained models. GIST introduces a trainable "Gist token" that serves as an aggregator to learn downstream task-specific knowledge. It also utilizes a bidirectional Kullback-Leibler divergence loss for explicit interaction between the task-agnostic knowledge from pre-training and task-specific knowledge for fine-tuning. This knowledge interaction better adapts the model to downstream tasks. Experiments across image classification, few-shot learning, and language understanding datasets demonstrate that integrating existing PEFT methods into the GIST framework boosts performance without significantly increasing parameters. For example, GIST improves adapter performance by 2.25% on the VTAB benchmark with only 0.01â€° additional parameters for ViT-B/16. The framework exhibits universality across models and tasks as well as scalability to integrate more advanced interaction losses in the future. Overall, GIST provides an efficient way to enhance PEFT methods by establishing explicit connections to downstream targets and facilitating comprehensive knowledge interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a GIST fine-tuning framework that introduces a trainable Gist token to aggregate task-specific knowledge and employs a Bidirectional Kullback-Leibler Divergence loss for explicit knowledge interaction, enhancing the performance of existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods without significantly increasing parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of a learnable Gist token, serving as an aggregator for task-specific knowledge acquisition. This establishes an explicit connection between learnable parameters and downstream tasks.

2. Pioneering the concept of knowledge interaction during the fine-tuning phase by employing a Bidirectional Kullback-Leibler Divergence objective for explicit interaction between task-agnostic and task-specific knowledge. 

3. Proposal of an innovative fine-tuning framework, dubbed GIST, that enhances the performance of existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods with almost no increase in trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the universality and scalability of this framework across tasks like image classification, few-shot learning, and language understanding.

So in summary, the key contribution is the GIST fine-tuning framework that improves existing PEFT techniques by facilitating better task-specific knowledge acquisition and interaction between task-agnostic and task-specific knowledge. This is achieved with negligible parameter overhead.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) - Methods that freeze most parameters of a pre-trained model and only train a small subset on downstream tasks to save compute and storage.

- Task-Agnostic Knowledge (TAK) / Task-Specific Knowledge (TSK)  - The broad knowledge learned during pre-training vs the specialized knowledge learned for a downstream task during fine-tuning.

- Gist Token ([GIST]) - A learnable token introduced to aggregate task-specific knowledge and provide an explicit connection between the trainable parameters and downstream tasks.  

- Knowledge Interaction - Explicitly facilitating interaction between the task-agnostic and task-specific knowledge via a loss function like the Bidirectional Kullback-Leibler Divergence (BKLD) loss.

- GIST Framework - The proposed fine-tuning framework incorporating the Gist token and BKLD loss to enhance performance of PEFT methods by improving task-specific knowledge acquisition and enabling better knowledge interaction.

- Universality and Scalability - Key characteristics of the GIST framework allowing it to boost performance of various PEFT methods across different tasks and datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new "Gist token" that serves as an aggregator for task-specific knowledge. However, how is this conceptually different from the standard classification token ([CLS]) used in models like BERT? What advantages does using a separate Gist token provide?

2. The Bidirectional Kullback-Leibler Divergence (BKLD) loss is used to enable knowledge interaction between the task-agnostic and task-specific knowledge. How sensitive is model performance to the temperature hyperparameter T used in this loss? Is there an optimal value?

3. The authors find that longer Gist tokens lead to worse performance. Why might this be the case? Is there a deeper connection between the optimal Gist token length and the length of the standard [CLS] token used during pre-training? 

4. How does adding the GIST framework and BKLD loss impact the computational efficiency of model fine-tuning? Is there a tradeoff between improved accuracy and training speed?

5. The method is evaluated on a diverse range of datasets spanning computer vision and NLP tasks. Are there any model architectures, task types or datasets where you would expect the GIST framework to not provide any benefit?

6. Could the concept of knowledge interaction loss be incorporated during pre-training rather than just fine-tuning? Might this lead to better priming of model parameters before downstream task training?  

7. The adapter tuning method sees the biggest improvement when used with the GIST framework. Why might this tuning method benefit more than others like prefix tuning or prompt tuning?

8. What modifications would need to be made to effectively apply the GIST fine-tuning approach to large-scale generative models like GPT-3?

9. How robust is the performance of models fine-tuned with the GIST framework to differences in dataset distribution between training and test sets? 

10. Could the GIST concepts be integrated with multi-task learning across diverse datasets to improve generalized knowledge interaction? How might the BKLD loss need to be adapted?
