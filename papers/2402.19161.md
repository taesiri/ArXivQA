# [MemoNav: Working Memory Model for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19161)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing visual navigation methods that utilize topological maps suffer from two key limitations: (1) They use all map nodes for decision-making without considering which nodes are actually relevant to reaching the goal. This leads to inefficient exploration as redundant nodes can mislead the agent. (2) Each node only represents local scene features instead of an overall representation of the entire environment. This limits the agent's capacity to leverage higher-level semantic and geometric clues for improved navigation.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes MemoNav, a novel memory model for image-goal navigation that introduces three types of navigation memory to address the aforementioned problems:

1) Short-term memory (STM): Stores local, transient features of nodes in the topological map. These features get dynamically updated.

2) Long-term memory (LTM): Learns a global scene-level representation by continuously aggregating STM features into a trainable global node that links to all STM nodes.  

3) Working memory (WM): Retains only the informative goal-relevant fraction of STM using an attention-based forgetting module. Also fuses the retained STM features and LTM using a graph attention network to generate adaptive WM for decision-making.

Main Contributions:
1) A forgetting module that removes redundant STM from the navigation pipeline based on an attention threshold, thereby improving efficiency.

2) Introduction of a global node as LTM that links to all STM nodes, providing the agent a high-level representation of scenes to mitigate partial observability.

3) A graph attention module that encodes the retained STM and LTM into goal-relevant WM for enhanced multi-goal navigation performance.  

Experiments show MemoNav significantly improves over previous methods on 1-goal and especially multi-goal tasks by leveraging selective scene memory representations. It also demonstrates better generalizability by evaluation on multiple 3D scene datasets.
