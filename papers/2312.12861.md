# [Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Formation Control without   Individual Reference Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12861)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of safe and robust formation control of teams of mobile robots using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Specifically, it focuses on behavior-based formation control, where the robots need to get into a formation defined by inter-robot distances while navigating towards goal locations. Ensuring safety during training and execution is critical for real-world deployment. Previous approaches rely on having individual goal locations for each robot, while this paper uses only a goal location for the formation's centroid, making it more scalable.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a MARL approach based on soft actor-critic combined with attention mechanisms to allow the robots to learn cooperative policies. Crucially, distributed model predictive control (MPC) safety filters are introduced to override unsafe actions during training and execution. The MPC uses a model of the robot dynamics and optimization to predict collisions and find minimum interventions to ensure safety. The robots are only given the goal location for the formation centroid and distances to neighbors rather than individual goals.

Main Contributions:

1) Applies safe RL to behavior-based formation control for the first time, ensuring safety during training and execution.

2) Robots learn to navigate to goals relying solely on centroid target and inter-robot distances rather than individual goals, enhancing scalability.

3) Trained policies can generalize to larger team sizes than used during training.

4) Comparative study of attention mechanisms for multi-agent RL in formation control.

5) MPC safety layer leads to faster convergence during training and ensures real-world safety.

6) Demonstration of learned formation behavior on real robots, where MPC safety filters guarantee no collisions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel safe MARL approach for behavior-based formation control that does not rely on individual robot goals. The use of MPC safety filters is key, ensuring safety and improving training. The method is shown to work on real robots.
