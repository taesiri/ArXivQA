# [Neural networks for abstraction and reasoning: Towards broad   generalization in machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of getting artificial intelligence (AI) systems to demonstrate human-like abilities of abstraction and reasoning. In particular, it focuses on the concept of "broad generalization", where systems can adapt to novel situations beyond their training data. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark was introduced in 2019 to systematically evaluate this capability, but despite significant efforts no system has solved more than 50% of the tasks. Current state-of-the-art systems rely on complex hand-crafted rules rather than machine learning.

Proposed Solutions: 
The paper investigates two approaches to make progress on ARC using neural networks:

1) Adapting the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning system by designing a new DSL called PeARL tailored to ARC and improvements like a recognition model to guide the search. This allows combinatorial search over programs to solve tasks.

2) Transforming ARC into a textual domain suitable for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3/4. With prompt engineering and data augmentation, LLMs display some skill at ARC reasoning.

An ensemble approach combines multiple complimentary solvers to exceed any individual system.

Main Contributions:
- New recognition model and PeARL language for DreamCoder doubles tasks solved over prior work 
- Demonstrates LLMs can start solving ARC with suitable encoding 
- Ensemble of DreamCoder and GPT-4 solves 50% more tasks than either individually
- Close gap to state-of-the-art hand crafted systems significantly
- Open source Python library arckit to stimulate more research

The results showcase promising learning-based approaches for abstraction and reasoning, though significant challenges remain in achieving human-level broad generalization. ARC remains an open challenge to motivate further progress in machine reasoning.
