# [SVInvNet: A Densely Connected Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Seismic   Velocity Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08194)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes SVInvNet, a novel deep learning architecture for seismic velocity inversion. SVInvNet uses an end-to-end encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) design optimized for processing complex information to address the challenges of nonlinear seismic velocity inversion. The architecture features densely connected encoder and decoder blocks with multiple connections between layers to allow efficient flow of information and gradient signals. Two large-scale paired datasets with 18,000 noiseless and 18,000 noisy seismic shot gather and velocity model pairs were generated for training and testing. Experiments were conducted with training set sizes ranging from 750 to 6,000 samples to analyze the impact of dataset size on learning outcomes. Testing was performed on a 12,000 sample benchmark to evaluate generalization capability. SVInvNet achieved superior performance compared to the baseline InversionNet architecture, despite having far fewer parameters (4 million vs 44 million). Increasing training set size resulted in reduced loss and improved similarity metrics. Comparisons to full waveform inversion revealed SVInvNet's improved effectiveness in estimating complex velocity models with faults and salt domes. The outcomes highlight SVInvNet's proficiency for seismic velocity inversion, especially with large diverse training data, while efficiently using parameters through its densely connected design.
