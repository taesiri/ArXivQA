# [Debiasing Machine Learning Models by Using Weakly Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models can produce biased decisions that systematically favor some groups over others based on sensitive attributes like age, financial status etc. 
- Most prior work on debiasing deals with discrete sensitive variables. This paper tackles the harder problem of continuous sensitive variables.
- The paper models the problem as a forecasting task with endogeneity i.e. correlation between independent variables (sensitive attributes) and the error term.

Proposed Solution:
- Post-process the outputs of a black-box ML model to mitigate bias, inspired by techniques from inverse problems.
- Use a neural network in a weakly supervised setting - only a small labeled dataset with true fair scores, and a distributional constraint based on Wasserstein distance.
- Two step process - initial local estimation followed by refinement using the neural network to match distribution and labeled samples.

Main Contributions:
- Handles continuous sensitive variables unlike most prior work. Setting inspired by econometrics.
- Learns notion of fairness from data distribution, does not pre-define subgroups or constraints.
- Model agnostic, black box approach applicable to any ML model.  
- Weakly supervised method reduces expert interventions. Matches distribution and few labeled samples.
- Theoretical guarantee bounding performance in terms of "specialist" models.
- Evaluation on synthetic 1D and 2D signals inspired by economics use cases. High quality estimates from 1% labeled data.
- Handles complex noise terms including product of sensitive attributes.
- Can track time-varying notions of fairness.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel weakly supervised approach to mitigate bias for continuous sensitive attributes by post-processing ML model outputs, with strong theoretical and empirical results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a weakly supervised learning approach using distributional constraints to mitigate bias in machine learning models for continuous-valued sensitive attributes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for debiasing machine learning models in the case where both the output of the model and the sensitive variable are continuous. Specifically:

- The paper models the problem as one of endogeneity (correlation between independent variables and the error term) as studied in econometrics. This allows framing debiasing as an inverse problem.

- A new debiasing method is proposed based on recent techniques from solving inverse problems using deep learning. The method trains a neural network regularizer in a weakly supervised manner, using only a small labeled dataset with "fair" scores plus matching the distribution of all scores to this fair distribution.

- Theoretical analysis is provided on how the method relates to optimizing the separate objectives of matching the labeled fair scores and matching distributions. Performance bounds are given.

- Experiments on synthetic 1D and 2D economic datasets demonstrate that the method can effectively debias machine learning models using only a small labeled dataset, outperforming standard instrumental variable techniques.

So in summary, the key innovation is a new weakly supervised debiasing approach tailored to the continuous output and sensitive variable setting, with both theoretical and empirical validation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Bias mitigation - The main focus of the paper is on debiasing and mitigating bias in machine learning models.

- Continuous sensitive variables - The paper deals with bias related to continuous sensitive attributes like age, financial status, etc. rather than discrete attributes.

- Endogeneity - The biased outputs are modeled using the concept of endogeneity from econometrics, where there is correlation between independent variables and the error term. 

- Weakly supervised learning - The debiasing approach uses a weakly supervised learning framework with only a small labeled dataset along with unlabeled data.

- Inverse problems - The methodology is inspired by recent techniques for solving inverse problems, transforming the bias mitigation issue into an inverse problem.

- Wasserstein distance - A distributional constraint based on the Wasserstein distance between the model output distribution and the fair distribution is used.

- Instrumental variables - An instrumental variable approach is used as a comparative benchmark for debiasing.

- Generalization - The method's effectiveness is evaluated on test datasets indicating its generalization capacity.

- Time-varying fairness - Simulations are conducted to assess the model's ability to track changes in the notion of fairness over time.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper models the biased output as the sum of two terms: an unbiased term $\varphi^{*}(\mathbf{x})$ and a bias term $U(\mathbf{x})$. How is modeling the bias in this additive way beneficial compared to other approaches? What assumptions does it make?

2. The method requires access to the probability distribution of fair/unbiased scores $\mathbb{P}(\varphi^{*})$. How is this distribution estimated in practice when you may only have access to a limited number of fair scores? What challenges arise in properly estimating this distribution?  

3. Explain the two key steps proposed to mitigate bias - finding the correct unbiased score values using the Wasserstein distance, and properly sorting those values using the labeled data. Why is each component necessary? What failure modes can occur if only one is used?

4. The theorem in Section 3.2 provides performance bounds by comparing to "specialist" models trained on individual terms. Explain the significance of this result and how it characterizes the method's guarantees. What assumptions are made in the proof?

5. The neural network architecture in Figure 5 is quite simple. What modifications could be made to the architecture to potentially improve performance? What architecture design choices need to be made to effectively operate on 2D image data?

6. Time-varying fairness is tested by changing the underlying fair function over time. Discuss the strengths and limitations of this evaluation approach compared to alternatives. What other ways could the adaptability of the method be tested?

7. Only 1% of training data is used as labeled data in some experiments. Discuss possible ways to actively select the most useful 1% subset instead of random selection. What existing techniques could be leverage?

8. The case study focuses on modeling bias in risk assignment for assurance companies. What other real-world use cases might this method be applicable to? What dataset properties would make it suitable?

9. Compare and contrast this weakly supervised learning approach to alternatives like the instrumental variable technique discussed. What are the key tradeoffs to consider? When might you prefer one over the other?

10. The method shows promising results, but has only been evaluated on synthetic datasets. What practical challenges or limitations might arise in applying it to real biased datasets from an application domain?
