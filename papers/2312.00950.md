# [Improve Supervised Representation Learning with Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Supervised representation learning using labeled data and classification loss has been the dominant approach for learning visual embeddings. Self-supervised approaches like masked image modeling (MIM) have also shown promise more recently. This paper explores whether combining these two objectives can lead to better representations.  

Method:
The authors propose a framework that combines a standard supervised classification loss with an additional MIM loss in a single training stage. The setup consists of a vision transformer (ViT) encoder shared between the two tasks, and a shallow transformer decoder for the MIM task. 

For the supervised task, images are passed to the encoder and classification loss is calculated as usual. For the MIM task, images are masked, encoded to produce partial representations, and passed to the decoder to reconstruct the discrete visual tokens predicted by VQGAN. The two losses are aggregated to update the shared encoder.

At test time, only the trained encoder is needed to extract representations. Thus, there is no inference overhead compared to supervised-only models.

Contributions:

(1) Proposes a simple and effective framework to combine supervised learning and MIM that imposes minimal architecture changes and no extra data.

(2) Shows consistent gains over strong baselines in classification (+2.01% on ImageNet), retrieval (+1.32%), and segmentation (+1.21% on ADE20K). Robustness also improves.

(3) Scales well - gains hold for larger ViT-L model and when pre-training on larger ImageNet-21K dataset.

(4) Provides in-depth analysis on loss formulations, encoder-decoder designs, impact of MIM at different stages, and compares with related concurrent work.

In summary, the paper presents a plug-and-play way to incorporate self-supervised MIM within supervised learning that clearly improves representation quality. The simplicity of the method while still boosting metrics across tasks highlights its effectiveness.
