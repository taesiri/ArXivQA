# [Llemma: An Open Language Model For Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10631)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an open-access language model specialized for mathematical reasoning that outperforms existing models?

The key hypothesis appears to be that continuing pretraining of an existing general language model (Code Llama) on a large dataset tailored for mathematics (\proofpiletwo) will yield a model (\llemma) with substantially improved capabilities on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to the base model and other existing models.

The paper aims to test this hypothesis by:

1) Creating the \proofpiletwo dataset, comprising scientific papers, web data, and code related to mathematics.

2) Using \proofpiletwo to continue pretraining Code Llama, resulting in the \llemma models. 

3) Evaluating \llemma models on a suite of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, comparing to Code Llama and other models.

4) Releasing the \llemma models, \proofpiletwo dataset, and code openly to serve as a platform for further research.

The central hypothesis is that this continued pretraining approach will improve mathematical reasoning abilities in an open-access model, which the empirical evaluations aim to validate. The open release additionally enables reproducibility and further research building off this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Training and releasing the Llemma models: 7B and 34B parameter language models specialized for mathematics. These models achieve new state-of-the-art results among publicly released models on the MATH benchmark for mathematical reasoning.

2. Releasing the Proof Pile-2, a new dataset of over 200 billion tokens for pretraining mathematical language models. This includes the Math Stack, a dataset of over 10 billion tokens of math-related code. 

3. Demonstrating the capabilities of the Llemma models, including using computational tools like Python and theorem provers with few-shot prompting. The models outperform prior work in few-shot settings without task-specific finetuning.

4. Analysis related to the training data mixture, potential memorization, and finetuning experiments. This provides insights into the model's capabilities and directions for future work. 

5. Releasing all models, data, and code publicly to serve as a platform for future research on language models for mathematics. The open release allows reproducibility and enables further exploration compared to prior proprietary work.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a recipe for specializing language models to mathematics through continued pretraining and targeted data collection. This is demonstrated through the release of the Llemma models and Proof Pile-2 dataset, which achieve strong mathematical reasoning capabilities in an open and reproducible framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents Llemma, a large language model specialized for mathematics through continued pretraining on a diverse dataset called ProofPile-2. Here is a comparison to related work:

- It builds on recent advances in scaling up the parameters and training data for generalist language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. The key novelty is adapting these models to the specific domain of math by pretraining on technical data.

- Compared to the proprietary Minerva model, Llemma is similarly pretrained on math data but uses only public data and code. It matches or exceeds Minerva's capabilities. Releasing Llemma enables further research. 

- Relative to prior math-specific LMs like ProofNet, Llemma achieves much stronger performance, likely due to its massive scale and pretraining dataset.

- For formal theorem proving, Llemma shows some basic few-shot capabilities. However, specialized systems like LeanDR still outperform Llemma, showing the value of deep integration of ML into proof assistants.

- The analysis of training data, model memorization, and impact of web data extends recent studies on the role of training data in LM performance.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the capability frontier for mathematical language models, while analyzing the ingredients underlying their capabilities. The public release facilitates reproducible research. Future work can build off Llemma for math reasoning and formal proofs.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper presents Llemma, a new large language model specialized for mathematics. The authors continue pretraining Code Llama, a code-focused language model, on a mixture of scientific papers, math-related web pages, and math code datasets. This continued pretraining yields the Llemma models, available in 7 billion and 34 billion parameter versions. Evaluation shows Llemma outperforms prior open language models on math problem solving benchmarks. It also demonstrates an ability to interact with tools like Python and theorem provers with minimal prompting. The models, training data, and code are all publicly released to enable further research. 

Paragraph 2: Key results include Llemma outperforming Code Llama by over 10 percentage points on the MATH and GSM8k benchmarks through chain of thought reasoning. It also exceeds the proprietary Minerva model's performance per parameter on MATH. For tool use, Llemma improves on Code Llama at solving GSM8k word problems by writing Python. It can also prove 20-22% of validation theorems on a formal dataset with only a 3 example prompt, showing promise for few-shot use of theorem provers. The authors analyze the training data composition and potential memorization. Overall, the work demonstrates the viability of an open access specialized language model for math and provides a platform to study mathematical language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for domain adaptation of large language models to mathematics through continued pretraining on \proofpiletwo, a diverse mixture of scientific papers, web data containing mathematics, and mathematical code. The authors start with Code Llama, a 7 billion parameter decoder-only transformer pretrained on code, and continue training it on \proofpiletwo for 200 billion tokens to obtain \llemma-7b. Similarly, they continue training Code Llama's 34 billion parameter version on \proofpiletwo for 50 billion tokens to obtain \llemma-34b. The continued pretraining on \proofpiletwo, which contains 200 billion tokens overall and has a carefully constructed mixture emphasizing mathematical content from the web and papers, allows \llemma to outperform Code Llama and other baselines on mathematical reasoning tasks while retaining generative capabilities. The authors demonstrate \llemma's mathematical abilities through evaluations on chain-of-thought problem solving, tool use with Python code, and few-shot theorem proving.
