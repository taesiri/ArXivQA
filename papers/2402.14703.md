# [On the Curses of Future and History in Future-dependent Value Functions   for Off-policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable environments modeled as POMDPs. A key challenge is that standard OPE methods like importance sampling suffer from exponential dependence on the horizon in their estimation error guarantees. The paper aims to develop OPE methods with polynomial guarantees that avoid this "curse of horizon".  

Proposed Solution - Future-Dependent Value Functions:
The paper builds on the framework of future-dependent value functions (FDVFs) proposed in prior work. FDVFs are functions of the future observations/actions that serve as proxies for the unobservable state value function. The guarantee for FDVF-based methods depends on the density ratio in the latent state space rather than the exponentially large observation/action history space. 

However, the guarantee also depends on the boundedness of the FDVF and related quantities, which the paper shows can still be exponential in horizon. The key contributions are:

1. Proposing the outcome coverage assumption which guarantees polynomial boundedness of FDVFs. This is a novel coverage notion concerning the future.

2. Proposing belief coverage assumption and effective history weights to obtain polynomial conversion between different Bellman residuals. This gives an intuitive understanding and leads to a new FDVF-based algorithm.  

3. Establishing $L_\infty$ versions of the coverage assumptions to avoid explicit dependence on the latent state space size. This leads to fully polynomial guarantees.

In summary, the paper provides significantly improved understanding of FDVF-based OPE in POMDPs under novel coverage assumptions tailored to POMDP structure. The results avoid exponential dependence on history length or state space size in the guarantees.
