# [On the Curses of Future and History in Future-dependent Value Functions   for Off-policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable environments modeled as POMDPs. A key challenge is that standard OPE methods like importance sampling suffer from exponential dependence on the horizon in their estimation error guarantees. The paper aims to develop OPE methods with polynomial guarantees that avoid this "curse of horizon".  

Proposed Solution - Future-Dependent Value Functions:
The paper builds on the framework of future-dependent value functions (FDVFs) proposed in prior work. FDVFs are functions of the future observations/actions that serve as proxies for the unobservable state value function. The guarantee for FDVF-based methods depends on the density ratio in the latent state space rather than the exponentially large observation/action history space. 

However, the guarantee also depends on the boundedness of the FDVF and related quantities, which the paper shows can still be exponential in horizon. The key contributions are:

1. Proposing the outcome coverage assumption which guarantees polynomial boundedness of FDVFs. This is a novel coverage notion concerning the future.

2. Proposing belief coverage assumption and effective history weights to obtain polynomial conversion between different Bellman residuals. This gives an intuitive understanding and leads to a new FDVF-based algorithm.  

3. Establishing $L_\infty$ versions of the coverage assumptions to avoid explicit dependence on the latent state space size. This leads to fully polynomial guarantees.

In summary, the paper provides significantly improved understanding of FDVF-based OPE in POMDPs under novel coverage assumptions tailored to POMDP structure. The results avoid exponential dependence on history length or state space size in the guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper proposes novel coverage assumptions tailored to the structure of POMDPs that enable polynomial dependence in horizon and avoid exponential dependence on observation space size for off-policy evaluation, leading to new algorithms with complementary properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs):

1. It proposes novel "outcome coverage" and "belief coverage" assumptions that enable polynomial dependence on the horizon in OPE guarantees, overcoming the "curses of future and history". These assumptions provide intuitive interpretations and have desirable properties.

2. It establishes fully polynomial guarantees for an existing OPE algorithm under the proposed assumptions, clearly demonstrating the benefit. It also improves the analysis to avoid explicit dependence on the latent state space size. 

3. It discovers a new algorithm based on modeling "effective history weights", establishing a guarantee analogous to marginalized importance sampling methods for MDPs. This provides an alternative with complementary properties.

4. More broadly, it provides significantly improved understanding of OPE in POMDPs, including interpretability of key quantities and coverage concepts tailored to POMDP structure. The analyses also connect to recent works in online POMDP exploration.

In summary, the paper makes both concrete algorithmic contributions as well as broader conceptual/structural advances that enable overcoming exponential dependencies in OPE for POMDPs.

The paper studies off-policy evaluation in partially observable environments modeled as POMDPs. It investigates future-dependent value functions, which were recently proposed as a promising framework for OPE with guarantees that avoid exponential dependence on the horizon. The paper introduces new assumptions called outcome coverage and belief coverage that enable polynomial bounds on key quantities in FDVF-based methods. It also discovers effective history weights to connect FDVF objectives with OPE objectives. Overall, the paper provides deeper understanding of overcoming the "curses of future and history" in OPE for POMDPs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "outcome coverage" to bound the range of future-dependent value functions (FDVFs). How does outcome coverage differ from traditional state coverage assumptions used in MDPs? What intuition explains why outcome coverage is more suitable for analyzing FDVFs?

2. The paper proposes using weighted minimum 2-norm solutions to construct FDVFs. Why is this preferred to using pseudo-inverse solutions? What properties make the weighted minimum 2-norm solution well-behaved even when pseudo-inverse can become poorly scaled?

3. The paper introduces "belief coverage" to bound the effective history weights $w^\star$. How does belief coverage connect to feature coverage assumptions made in linear MDPs? What is the key difference that makes belief coverage more suitable for POMDPs?

4. How do the $L_\infty$ versions of outcome and belief coverage improve upon the basic $L_2$ versions? When are the $L_2$ versions preferable over the $L_\infty$ versions? What tradeoffs exist between the two?  

5. The paper shows that, without additional assumptions, bounding the conversion ratio $\mathrm{IV}(\Vcal)$ requires exponential dependence on horizon/observation spaces. What insight does this provide about Bellman Completeness?  

6. The new algorithm based on effective history weights draws connections to Marginalized Importance Sampling (MIS) for MDPs. How does the analysis leverage properties of $w^\star$ that are unique to POMDP structure?

7. While avoiding explicit dependence on latent state space size $S$, the coverage assumptions still have indirect $S$-dependence. Can the analysis be strengthened further to remove any $S$ dependence? What barriers make this difficult?

8. How do the proposed methods address limitations of model-based methods and history-based MDP reductions for OPE in POMDPs? What advantages do they offer over these existing approaches?

9. The curse of memory is discussed briefly. What assumptions could be made on policy structure to mitigate this curse? How might ideas from the paper extend to handle policies with memory?

10. What implications might the analysis have for other POMDP problems like online exploration or policy optimization? Could the coverage assumptions provide insight into fundamental limits in these settings?
