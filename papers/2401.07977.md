# [Leveraging External Knowledge Resources to Enable Domain-Specific   Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine reading comprehension (MRC) models perform well on general domain text but their performance degrades when applied to domain-specific text due to domain shift between training and application data.
- Domain-specific variants of BERT (e.g. BioBERT, SciBERT) require expensive pre-training on domain corpora.
- Prior work has shown knowledge graphs can improve transformer performance but requires vocabulary overlap between model and knowledge embeddings.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a domain-agnostic strategy to align knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) with transformer embeddings using a feedforward neural network (FFNN).
- Does not require vocabulary overlap between KGE and transformer vocabularies.
- Also incorporate definition embeddings for identified domain terms by passing definitions through transformer in feature extraction mode.
- Fuse aligned KGE and definition embeddings with transformer embeddings during fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed FFNN based embedding alignment method that does not rely on vocabulary overlap and can handle domain terms that are phrases.
- Show BERT can achieve similar performance to domain-specific BioBERT on COVID-QA span detection using proposed approach.  
- RoBERTa outperforms SciBERT on COVID-QA when enhanced with proposed method.
- Observed overall improvement on PubMedQA multiple choice QA over domain-specific variants.
- Release updated and cleaned version of COVID-QA dataset.

The key idea is to equip non-domain-specific LMs with relevant knowledge using proposed embedding fusion so they can perform closer to domain-specific variants without requiring expensive domain pre-training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to improve the performance of general-purpose language models on domain-specific machine reading comprehension tasks by aligning and fusing external knowledge graph embeddings and definition embeddings into the input representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a domain-agnostic strategy for aligning embeddings spaces using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that does not require vocabulary overlap between the spaces and can work with multi-word phrases/entities.

2) Showing that by incorporating knowledge graph embeddings and definition embeddings into BERT and RoBERTa using their proposed method, these general domain models can perform at a level comparable to domain-specific models like BioBERT and SciBERT on machine reading comprehension tasks. 

3) Releasing an updated and cleaned version of the COVID-QA dataset for span extraction machine reading comprehension.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a way to equip general domain language models with external knowledge to make them competitive with domain-specific models on domain-specific tasks, without requiring expensive domain-specific pre-training.

The paper focuses on improving machine reading comprehension for domain-specific texts by integrating external knowledge from sources like knowledge graphs and definitions during the fine-tuning process. Key aspects include entity linking, learning embeddings, aligning embedding spaces, and concatenation strategies for injecting these external representations. The techniques are evaluated on COVID-19 and biomedical QA datasets against baseline and domain-specific transformer models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a domain-agnostic strategy for embedding alignment using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). What are the advantages of using MLPs over prior alignment methods like the Mikolov approach? How does avoiding reliance on vocabulary overlap help with integrating knowledge graph embeddings?

2. The paper integrates two sources of external knowledge - knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) and definition embeddings. What is the motivation behind using both types of embeddings instead of just one? How do you think they provide complementary information? 

3. The paper experiments with different strategies for concatenating the external embeddings, namely BERTRAM and DEKCOR concatenation. Why do you think the performance differs based on the concatenation strategy, especially for RoBERTa? What explanations are provided?

4. The results show that incorporating external knowledge helps bridge the performance gap between domain-specific and non-domain specific models on the COVID-QA dataset. However, the gains are more modest on the PubMedQA dataset. What factors might explain this discrepancy in the utility of external knowledge infusion across the two tasks/datasets?  

5. Ablation studies in the paper analyze the impact of using just KGE versus just definition embeddings. For BERT, definitions seem more impactful on COVID-QA while for RoBERTa the KGE help more with exact match. What might explain these differences? How could this inform strategies for knowledge selection/integration?

6. The paper argues that even incorporating random entity embeddings provides some performance gains over vanilla fine-tuning. What explanation is provided for why this might happen? Do you think this indicates something about the approach or datasets?

7. One discussion point is that BERTRAM versus DEKCOR concatenation has different impacts across model types. In particular, RoBERTa seems more sensitive in some cases. What explanation related to tokenization is provided? Do you think this issue can be addressed?

8. How computationally demanding is the proposed homogenization approach? Could the need to retrain for each new transformer become a bottleneck? What counter-arguments does the paper provide?

9. The paper states more research is needed into input representation modification methods that don't increase model complexity. What types of approaches could be explored to achieve this aim? 

10. Despite knowledge infusion, model performance remains relatively poor in an absolute sense on these tasks. What architectural or dataset issues might underpin this underperformance? How could they be addressed in future work?
