# [Neuromorphic Wireless Device-Edge Co-Inference via the Directed   Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers a device-edge co-inference system for efficient semantic-aware communication to support edge intelligence applications. Specifically, it addresses the challenges of constrained bandwidth, storage, and computing capacity in edge inference systems with increasing number of edge devices. 

- The goal is to develop a semantic-aware system architecture that can reduce communication overhead by transmitting only task-relevant information, while still maintaining good inference performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel neuromorphic wireless cognition architecture consisting of:
  (1) Semantic encoder: An on-device spiking neural network (SNN) that compresses the input data into a task-relevant representation.
  (2) Wireless channel: Impulse radio transmission using pulse-based modulation to communicate the SNN output spikes.
  (3) Semantic decoder: An artificial neural network (ANN) at the edge server that performs inference using the received spikes.

- The system is optimized end-to-end based on the directed information bottleneck principle to maximize the task-relevant information transmitted while minimizing the communication rate. 

- The SNN encoder and ANN decoder modules are trained jointly using stochastic gradient descent, with the SNN gradients estimated using the REINFORCE algorithm.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel energy-efficient neuromorphic architecture for semantic-aware device-edge co-inference that integrates neuromorphic sensing, computing and spike-based communication.

- Introduces directed information bottleneck optimization for an end-to-end trainable hybrid SNN-ANN system architecture.

- Demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness against channel noise compared to conventional separate source-channel coding baselines in experiments on neuromorphic MNIST datasets.

- The proposed semantic-aware edge inference architecture enables reduced communication overhead and latency while maintaining good task performance. The brain-inspired neuromorphic implementation brings efficiency advantages.
