# [QACP: An Annotated Question Answering Dataset for Assisting Chinese   Python Programming Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of high-quality Chinese question-answering datasets to support developing intelligent teaching assistants for Python programming education. This data scarcity limits training specialized large language models (LLMs) to aid Chinese Python learners. 

- General pre-trained LLMs still struggle with accurately answering Python questions posed in Chinese and lack specialized programming knowledge. Their performance needs improvement to serve as effective AI teaching assistants.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a new Chinese question-answering dataset called QACP targeted at Python learners with 10,960 real-world questions.

- QACP covers diverse learner backgrounds and question complexities. The questions span from basic concepts to advanced applications.

- Each question has detailed answers from 3 key perspectives to aid understanding: accessible explanations, classic analogies, and code examples.

- Answers are carefully designed by experienced instructors based on educational theories to provide high pedagogical value. 

Main Contributions:
- First high-quality Chinese question-answering dataset tailored for Python programming education with over 10K questions.

- Careful answer design and rigorous quality control process to ensure usefulness for learners.

- In-depth experiments and analysis benchmarking capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing limitations in handling Chinese Python questions.

- QACP provides a solid data resource to empower developing specialized intelligent programming tutors for Chinese users and drive future research.

In summary, the paper introduces a valuable new dataset to support Chinese programming education and analyzes the current challenges LLMs face in serving as effective tutors. QACP and the benchmark tasks facilitate developing specialized LLMs for Chinese Python learning assistance.
