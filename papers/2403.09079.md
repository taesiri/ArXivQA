# [PreSight: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Perception with City-Scale NeRF   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09079)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on perception systems to navigate, but these systems still face challenges in conditions like occlusion, extreme lighting, or unfamiliar environments. Humans can perceive new environments by developing a preliminary mental map from past experiences that aids perception in subsequent visits. This inspired the authors to develop a system that similarly constructs priors from historical traversal data to enhance online perception for autonomous vehicles.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose PreSight, a framework that leverages past traversal data to build city-scale neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that serve as rich priors to improve online perception models. It involves:

1) Constructing semantic and geometric city-scale NeRFs from historical images and poses using Instant-NGP with distilled features from DINO. The city is divided into tiles, each with sub-fields for coverage. 

2) Extracting structured priors using ray marching to identify occupied voxels and gather their semantic features from the NeRFs.

3) Integrating the priors into online models by encoding them as BEV or 3D features and fusing with online features using CNNs.

Main Contributions:

1) A new framework, PreSight, that automatically constructs powerful priors from historical data to enhance online perception systems.

2) Demonstration that the framework significantly boosts performance of state-of-the-art online models on HD map construction and occupancy prediction tasks in the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its versatility and efficacy.

In summary, PreSight leverages past experiences to construct rich priors that can seamlessly integrate with and boost current perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Experiments validate its ability to enhance model performance on multiple static environment perception tasks.
