# [PreSight: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Perception with City-Scale NeRF   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09079)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on perception systems to navigate, but these systems still face challenges in conditions like occlusion, extreme lighting, or unfamiliar environments. Humans can perceive new environments by developing a preliminary mental map from past experiences that aids perception in subsequent visits. This inspired the authors to develop a system that similarly constructs priors from historical traversal data to enhance online perception for autonomous vehicles.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose PreSight, a framework that leverages past traversal data to build city-scale neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that serve as rich priors to improve online perception models. It involves:

1) Constructing semantic and geometric city-scale NeRFs from historical images and poses using Instant-NGP with distilled features from DINO. The city is divided into tiles, each with sub-fields for coverage. 

2) Extracting structured priors using ray marching to identify occupied voxels and gather their semantic features from the NeRFs.

3) Integrating the priors into online models by encoding them as BEV or 3D features and fusing with online features using CNNs.

Main Contributions:

1) A new framework, PreSight, that automatically constructs powerful priors from historical data to enhance online perception systems.

2) Demonstration that the framework significantly boosts performance of state-of-the-art online models on HD map construction and occupancy prediction tasks in the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its versatility and efficacy.

In summary, PreSight leverages past experiences to construct rich priors that can seamlessly integrate with and boost current perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Experiments validate its ability to enhance model performance on multiple static environment perception tasks.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel framework called PreSight that leverages historical data to automatically construct powerful priors using neural radiance fields (NeRF). These priors can capture semantic and geometric details of urban environments without requiring manual annotations.

The paper introduces a framework called "PreSight" that leverages historical traversal data to construct city-scale neural radiance field (NeRF) priors. These priors are then used to enhance the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles by integrating them with online perception models for tasks like HD map construction and occupancy prediction. Key ideas include using NeRF for 3D reconstruction without manual annotation, distilling semantic knowledge into the priors, and seamlessly integrating the priors to boost performance on static environment perception tasks. The self-supervised framework aims to improve adaptability and reliability for autonomous driving systems when deployed in new, unfamiliar environments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions dividing the city into 1km^2 tiles when building the city-scale NeRF model. What considerations went into determining this tile size and how might changing this size impact model performance?

2. When extracting structured priors from the NeRF model using ray marching, how was the threshold determined for identifying surface points along each ray? What tradeoffs are involved in setting this threshold?

3. What motivated the design choice of using separate MLP heads for color, semantics, and sky appearance predictions in the NeRF model? How do these different outputs get combined during volumetric rendering?

4. The method masks out dynamic objects like vehicles and pedestrians during NeRF optimization using segmentation maps. What impact would retaining these objects have on the quality of the generated priors?

5. How was the DINO model utilized to generate semantic features for incorporation into the NeRF model? What modifications, if any, were made to the base DINO model?

6. What considerations were made in terms of memory usage and computational efficiency when building and storing the city-scale NeRF models? How might this framework scale to even larger environments?

7. The integration module uses a series of CNN layers to encode the voxel priors into BEV/3D features before merging with online model features. What design choices went into these CNNs?

8. Could the proposed framework work with other types of historical input data such as stereo imagery or sequences with inaccurate poses? What challenges would need to be addressed?

9. Beyond HD semantic mapping and occupancy prediction, what other autonomous driving perception tasks could benefit from the scene priors generated by this method?

10. The paper demonstrates performance gains on a resplit nuScenes dataset. How well would you expect this method to work on entirely new geographic areas not seen during training? What factors influence the generalization capability?
