# [Human-Inspired Facial Sketch Synthesis with Dynamic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00216)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate high-quality and style-controllable facial sketches from input photos using comprehensive facial information including 3D geometry, 2D appearance, and controllable style. The key hypotheses are:1. Facial 3D geometry represented by depth maps plays an important role in guiding the sketch generation process, similar to how human artists utilize 3D structure when drawing.2. Dynamically modulating neuron activations in the generator network based on facial depth, appearance features, and style code can produce sketches with realistic textures adapted to the inputs. 3. Using deformable convolutions to align features can create distinct and abstract sketch outlines like human artists.4. Combining depth information, dynamic feature modulation, and deformable alignment enables generating high quality sketches with controllable styles for a wide range of challenging input photos.In summary, the central research question is facial sketch synthesis with a focus on leveraging 3D geometry, dynamic adaptation, and style control. The hypotheses aim to show these techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel facial sketch synthesis method called Human-Inspired Dynamic Adaptation (HIDA) that incorporates facial 3D geometry, 2D appearance, and global style control to generate high quality sketches. 2. It introduces two key techniques:- Informative and Dynamic Adaptation (IDA): A module that dynamically modulates neuron activations based on facial depth, appearance, and style through a novel dynamic normalization module (DySPADE) and dynamic activation function (InfoACON). This mimics how human artists adapt their drawing techniques.- Deformable Outline Generation (DOG): Uses deformable convolutions to align features at coarse scales and generate abstract, distinct sketch outlines like human artists.3. Experiments show HIDA generates higher quality and more robust sketches across multiple styles and challenging unconstrained faces compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also allows precise style control.4. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each of the main components of HIDA. The approach also generalizes well to other image-to-image translation tasks like generating pen drawings and oil paintings.In summary, the main contribution is a new facial sketch synthesis method that leverages multiple information sources like human artists and uses dynamic adaptation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance and robustness. The key ideas could be applied to other generative image tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a facial sketch synthesis method called Human-Inspired Dynamic Adaptation (HIDA) that uses facial depth maps and style controls to dynamically modulate neuron activations in order to generate high-quality and controllable sketch portraits over a wide range of challenging facial photos.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in facial sketch synthesis:- Uses facial depth information: This paper uniquely incorporates facial depth maps, estimated by an off-the-shelf predictor, as an input to help convey 3D geometry in the synthesized sketches. Most prior work uses only 2D image or semantic information. - Dynamic adaptation modules: The paper proposes novel dynamic normalization (DySPADE) and activation (InfoACON) modules that modulate features based on depth, appearance, and style. This allows flexible adaptation to local facial properties. Other methods typically use static normalization like SPADE.- Mimics artist process: The method is inspired by how human artists create sketches, using outlines, shading, abstraction, and style consistency. This differentiates it from many data-driven deep learning methods.- Strong results on challenging data: Experiments show the approach produces high quality, multi-style sketches on diverse real-world photos. It outperforms prior state-of-the-art on criteria like FID/LPIPS.- Generalizable: Though trained only on facial sketches, the model generalizes well to other image types like scenes. This suggests the adaptive methods are broadly useful.Overall, the key novelties are the use of depth information, dynamic feature modulation, and modeling the human artistic process. This allows the method to synthesize very high quality and controllable sketches from challenging real-world photos. The generalizability also highlights the wider applicability of the proposed techniques.
