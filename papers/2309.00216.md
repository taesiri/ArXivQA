# [Human-Inspired Facial Sketch Synthesis with Dynamic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00216)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate high-quality and style-controllable facial sketches from input photos using comprehensive facial information including 3D geometry, 2D appearance, and controllable style. The key hypotheses are:1. Facial 3D geometry represented by depth maps plays an important role in guiding the sketch generation process, similar to how human artists utilize 3D structure when drawing.2. Dynamically modulating neuron activations in the generator network based on facial depth, appearance features, and style code can produce sketches with realistic textures adapted to the inputs. 3. Using deformable convolutions to align features can create distinct and abstract sketch outlines like human artists.4. Combining depth information, dynamic feature modulation, and deformable alignment enables generating high quality sketches with controllable styles for a wide range of challenging input photos.In summary, the central research question is facial sketch synthesis with a focus on leveraging 3D geometry, dynamic adaptation, and style control. The hypotheses aim to show these techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel facial sketch synthesis method called Human-Inspired Dynamic Adaptation (HIDA) that incorporates facial 3D geometry, 2D appearance, and global style control to generate high quality sketches. 2. It introduces two key techniques:- Informative and Dynamic Adaptation (IDA): A module that dynamically modulates neuron activations based on facial depth, appearance, and style through a novel dynamic normalization module (DySPADE) and dynamic activation function (InfoACON). This mimics how human artists adapt their drawing techniques.- Deformable Outline Generation (DOG): Uses deformable convolutions to align features at coarse scales and generate abstract, distinct sketch outlines like human artists.3. Experiments show HIDA generates higher quality and more robust sketches across multiple styles and challenging unconstrained faces compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also allows precise style control.4. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each of the main components of HIDA. The approach also generalizes well to other image-to-image translation tasks like generating pen drawings and oil paintings.In summary, the main contribution is a new facial sketch synthesis method that leverages multiple information sources like human artists and uses dynamic adaptation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance and robustness. The key ideas could be applied to other generative image tasks.
