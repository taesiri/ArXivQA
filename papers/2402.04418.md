## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of learning-based algorithms for navigation and control of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a focus on real-time implementable online learning approaches. Multirotor UAVs are gaining popularity in various civilian and public domain applications due to their maneuverability and efficiency. However, developing robust navigation controllers for autonomous flight in uncertain environments remains a key challenge. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper reviews and classifies learning-based algorithms applied to multirotors into offline and online learning categories since 2015. Offline learning trains the system on data before deployment, while online learning enables continuous real-time learning during operation. The algorithms are further categorized into machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. A detailed table summarizes 55 offline learning papers on tasks like trajectory tracking, landing, formation control etc. and what is being learned in each case.  

For online learning, 11 key papers are reviewed in detail, analyzing the learning approach, what and why something is being learned, computational complexity, comparison with other methods and results obtained. The focus is on understanding real-time applicability and how fast learning happens. Algorithms range from combinations of fuzzy logic, neural networks and PID to various reinforcement learning techniques for control and navigation objectives.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive up-to-date review of learning-based algorithms for multirotor control, with emphasis on online learning
- Structured analysis of offline and online methods explaining learning objectives, approaches and computational feasibility
- Summary tables of offline learning papers classified by learning models and tasks  
- Detailed review of online papers comparing learning mechanisms, advantages, limitations and performance
- Understanding of state-of-the-art and real-time applicability of learning techniques to facilitate further research

The paper provides researchers a foundation to build upon by clearly distinguishing offline and online methods, evaluating real-time feasibility and laying out advantages, limitations and performance of different contemporary algorithms applied to multirotor control and navigation.
