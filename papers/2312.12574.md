# [Generator Assisted Mixture of Experts For Feature Acquisition in Batch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of feature acquisition, where given a partial set of observed features for an instance, the goal is to select additional unobserved features to query so as to maximize the accuracy of a classifier. Prior works have studied this problem in a sequential setting, where features are acquired one at a time. However, the paper argues that in some applications like healthcare, there may be significant delays in obtaining query results, so it is more practical to acquire features in batches. 

Proposed Solution - GENEX:
The paper proposes a novel batch feature acquisition method called GENEX. The key ideas are:

(1) Use a feature generator to produce synthetic values for some feature subsets, instead of having to query all of them from an oracle. This reduces query costs.

(2) Partition the heterogeneous dataset into buckets using random hyperplane guided clustering. This transforms the space into homogeneous clusters.

(3) Build a mixture of experts model, with each expert specializing in a cluster. This handles heterogeneity across the entire space.  

(4) Formulate tractable objectives for choosing optimal feature subsets per cluster, using confidence scores from the generator. Solve these approximately using greedy optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Novel problem formulation for batch feature acquisition using a generator
- Technique to partition heterogeneous spaces into homogeneous clusters  
- Tractable objectives for feature selection using generator confidence 
- Mixture of experts model to handle heterogeneity
- Theoretical analysis providing approximation guarantees for the greedy optimizer

The method is evaluated on real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines for batch feature acquisition by a significant margin. The use of a generator is shown to reduce query costs 3-5x for a minor drop in accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called GENEX for batch feature acquisition that uses a generator to reduce oracle queries, partitions data into buckets for training mixture of experts models, and employs greedy optimization with approximation guarantees to select feature subsets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Using a feature generator to reduce the number of expensive oracle queries needed by generating some feature values instead of querying them. This reduces the overall cost while maintaining accuracy.

2. Employing a mixture of experts model on partitioned data to handle heterogeneity and scale better, with each expert specializing in a cluster of more homogeneous data. 

3. Formulating tractable lower bounds and greedy optimization algorithms for selecting good feature subsets to acquire in batch, using new notions of approximate monotonicity and submodularity.

4. Experimental evaluation on four datasets demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for feature acquisition, in terms of the tradeoff between accuracy and acquisition cost. The use of a generator is shown to provide significant cost savings with marginal loss of accuracy.

In summary, the key innovation is the joint modeling of a generator and classifier to reduce oracle queries, combined with partitioning and mixture of experts to handle heterogeneity, and new greedy subset selection methods, all tailored for batch feature acquisition.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Feature acquisition: Selecting a subset of initially unobserved features to acquire/query that will improve model accuracy.

- Batch feature acquisition: Acquiring features in a batch rather than sequentially, which is required in some real-world scenarios like healthcare where there are delays in getting test results. 

- Mixture of experts: Partitioning the heterogeneous dataset into clusters/domains and training separate models (experts) on each cluster to handle diversity across instances. 

- Generative model: Using a variational autoencoder as a feature generator to produce synthetic feature values for some instances, avoiding costly queries to an oracle/external source.

- Greedy algorithm: A greedy iterative algorithm used to select good feature subsets by optimizing a loss function involving oracle and generated features.

- Approximation guarantees: Providing a theoretical analysis of the greedy algorithm and approximation bounds based on notions like weak submodularity extended to handle use of generated features.

Some other notable ideas are random hyperplane clustering, optimization decoupling across clusters, surrogate loss function, and inference method leveraging confidence on generated features.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses a feature generator to reduce the number of oracle queries. How does the feature generator work? What is the architecture and objective used to train it? How effective is it in mimicking the true feature distribution?

2. The paper employs a mixture of experts model to handle heterogeneity in the features. Why is handling this heterogeneity important? How does the random hyperplane clustering method used for creating the mixture model buckets compare to other clustering techniques like k-means? 

3. The paper introduces the concepts of (mmin,mmax)-partial monotonicity and (gmin,gmax)-weak submodularity for analyzing the objective functions. Explain these concepts and how they are used to derive approximation guarantees for the greedy algorithm.

4. Walk through the derivations that connect the intractable objective function in Eq 3 with the tractable objectives in Eq 7 and Eq 8. What assumptions are made in defining the F function?

5. The inference algorithm uses a threshold on classifier confidence to decide when to use generated features. Analyze the tradeoffs in using a learned supervisor versus a heuristic confidence threshold.

6. The paper demonstrates scalability on large datasets like CIFAR100 and TinyImagenet. What modifications were made to scale up existing baselines? How do the runtimes compare?

7. Analyze the behavior of accuracy as the number of mixture components is varied. Why does performance degrade at very high numbers of components?

8. Theoretical guarantees are provided for the greedy algorithm. Based on the dataset statistics, quantify the tightness of these guarantees. Can they be further improved? 

9. The paper considers batch feature acquisition. How would the method change if sequential acquisition was allowed instead? Would the baselines perform better?

10. The feature generator is pre-trained and then fixed while optimizing the acquisition policy. Could there be benefits in continuing to refine the generator jointly with the policy? Analyze the tradeoffs.
