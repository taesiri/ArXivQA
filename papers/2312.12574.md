# [Generator Assisted Mixture of Experts For Feature Acquisition in Batch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of feature acquisition, where given a partial set of observed features for an instance, the goal is to select additional unobserved features to query so as to maximize the accuracy of a classifier. Prior works have studied this problem in a sequential setting, where features are acquired one at a time. However, the paper argues that in some applications like healthcare, there may be significant delays in obtaining query results, so it is more practical to acquire features in batches. 

Proposed Solution - GENEX:
The paper proposes a novel batch feature acquisition method called GENEX. The key ideas are:

(1) Use a feature generator to produce synthetic values for some feature subsets, instead of having to query all of them from an oracle. This reduces query costs.

(2) Partition the heterogeneous dataset into buckets using random hyperplane guided clustering. This transforms the space into homogeneous clusters.

(3) Build a mixture of experts model, with each expert specializing in a cluster. This handles heterogeneity across the entire space.  

(4) Formulate tractable objectives for choosing optimal feature subsets per cluster, using confidence scores from the generator. Solve these approximately using greedy optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Novel problem formulation for batch feature acquisition using a generator
- Technique to partition heterogeneous spaces into homogeneous clusters  
- Tractable objectives for feature selection using generator confidence 
- Mixture of experts model to handle heterogeneity
- Theoretical analysis providing approximation guarantees for the greedy optimizer

The method is evaluated on real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines for batch feature acquisition by a significant margin. The use of a generator is shown to reduce query costs 3-5x for a minor drop in accuracy.
