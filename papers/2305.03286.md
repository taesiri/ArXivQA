# [Composite Motion Learning with Task Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03286)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train physics-based character controllers to perform composite motions by combining multiple motion clips as reference, while also accomplishing goal-directed tasks?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new approach for training physics-based character controllers to perform composite motions. This means combining partial body motions from multiple reference motion clips into a single full-body motion.- Existing methods rely on having full-body motion capture as reference. This paper aims to synthesize composite motions without needing full-body reference motions.- The approach also incorporates goal-directed control objectives, so the character can accomplish specific tasks while performing the composite motions. - A multi-objective reinforcement learning framework is proposed to balance learning from disparate motion references and task objectives.- An incremental learning scheme is introduced to quickly adapt existing policies to new composite motions by reusing parts of the original motions.In summary, the central research contribution is a new training methodology to create physics-based character controllers capable of composite motions from multiple motion clips and goal-directed control, using multi-objective reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach for physics-based character control that can learn complex composite motions by combining multiple motion clips as reference. The key ideas include:- Decoupling full-body control into learning partial-body motions from different reference sources. This allows combining motions in a modular way without needing pre-blended full-body motions. - Converting the problem into a multi-objective learning framework with a multi-critic architecture. This allows handling the multiple imitation objectives and task goals in a balanced way.- An incremental learning scheme to accelerate training by reusing a pre-trained policy as a meta policy. The new policy cooperates with the meta policy to adapt it for new tasks.In summary, the main contribution is a new framework for physics-based character control that can effectively learn complex composite motions involving multiple imitation sources and task goals. The key novelty is decoupling full-body control and formulating it as a multi-objective learning problem. This provides an automated way to blend motions and balance multiple objectives without tedious manual effort.
