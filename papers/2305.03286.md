# [Composite Motion Learning with Task Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03286)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train physics-based character controllers to perform composite motions by combining multiple motion clips as reference, while also accomplishing goal-directed tasks?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new approach for training physics-based character controllers to perform composite motions. This means combining partial body motions from multiple reference motion clips into a single full-body motion.- Existing methods rely on having full-body motion capture as reference. This paper aims to synthesize composite motions without needing full-body reference motions.- The approach also incorporates goal-directed control objectives, so the character can accomplish specific tasks while performing the composite motions. - A multi-objective reinforcement learning framework is proposed to balance learning from disparate motion references and task objectives.- An incremental learning scheme is introduced to quickly adapt existing policies to new composite motions by reusing parts of the original motions.In summary, the central research contribution is a new training methodology to create physics-based character controllers capable of composite motions from multiple motion clips and goal-directed control, using multi-objective reinforcement learning.
