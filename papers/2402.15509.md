# [Seamless Human Motion Composition with Blended Positional Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of generative human motion composition (HMC) - generating long, continuous sequences of human motion guided by varying textual descriptions over different time intervals. This is challenging because:

1) Existing datasets only have short motion sequences (up to 10 seconds) with a single textual description governing the entire sequence. 

2) Prior works using autoregressive models struggle with error accumulation over long sequences and lack robustness when transitions between actions are scarce or unseen during training. 

3) Prior diffusion models require redundant denoising steps and predetermined transition lengths between independently generated subsequences.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FlowMDM, the first diffusion model that generates seamless human motion compositions simultaneously without any postprocessing or extra denoising steps. The main ideas are:

1) Blended Positional Encodings (BPE): A novel technique that combines absolute and relative positional encodings during sampling. Absolute encodings recover global motion coherence early on while relative encodings promote smooth transitions later.

2) Pose-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCAT): A new attention mechanism that makes the model robust to varying textual descriptions at inference time by minimizing entanglement between the noisy poses and conditions.

Main Contributions:

1) First simultaneous diffusion model for seamless long-range human motion composition without redundant steps.

2) Blended Positional Encodings technique to leverage benefits of both absolute and relative encodings for diffusion models. 

3) Pose-Centric Cross-Attention tailored for conditional diffusion models to handle varying conditions at inference.

4) State-of-the-art results on Babel and HumanML3D datasets in terms of accuracy, realism and smoothness.

5) Introduction of two new metrics - Peak Jerk and Area Under Jerk to effectively evaluate transition smoothness.

The paper makes notable strides in long-range controllable human motion composition with diffusion models.
