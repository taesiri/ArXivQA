# [EmoTalker: Emotionally Editable Talking Face Generation via Diffusion   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08049)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing talking face generation methods have limited ability to generalize to challenging identities and edit intricate emotions beyond a single emotion type. 

- Methods are often identity-specific, requiring training on multiple images of the target identity showing various emotions.

Proposed Solution - EmoTalker:

- A conditional diffusion model that generates emotional talking faces by guiding the denoising process using text prompts with emotion labels and strengths.

- Modifies denoising during inference to preserve facial identity by combining the denoised output with the input at each step. 

- Introduces Emotion Intensity Block to analyze emotions and strengths in text prompts using pretrained modules.

- Employs an emotion perception block to match generated expressions with prompt emotions.

Main Contributions:

- Modified diffusion model that controls facial expressions via textual emotion prompts and strengths.

- Improved identity preservation for better generalization using a facial information preserving technique.

- Emotion Intensity Block to understand nuanced emotions and intensities from text.

- Collected and utilized Facial Emotion Description (FED) dataset to train emotion analysis modules.

- Experiments show EmoTalker generates intricate emotional expressions aligned to prompts while maintaining identity. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion accuracy.

In summary, EmoTalker advances emotional talking face generation via a conditional diffusion approach with identity preservation and better emotion editing abilities using text prompts. The introduced emotion analysis pipeline and dataset enable modeling of intricate emotions.
