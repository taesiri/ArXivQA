# Chain of Thought Prompt Tuning in Vision Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can vision-language models be improved to better generalize to novel visual concepts by approximating human reasoning processes?Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:1. Conducting effective reasoning is important for visual tasks, not just language tasks. 2. Applying a "chain of thought" approach where models are trained to generate step-by-step reasoning can enhance reasoning abilities and generalization performance of vision-language models.3. This chain of thought approach can be adapted to the vision domain by combining visual and textual embeddings across a series of chained prompts and networks.The key hypothesis is that mimicking human-like reasoning through a chained, step-by-step process will allow vision-language models to generalize better to new concepts beyond the training data. This is tested across image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel chain of thought prompt tuning framework for vision-language modeling. The key ideas are:1. Designing a chain of prompts to mimic human step-by-step reasoning process. Each prompt receives information from the previous prompt and passes its information to the next prompt. 2. Adding a self-adaptive chain controller to dynamically control the chain based on the image input, allowing different images to have customized reasoning processes.3. Chaining a series of Meta-Nets to generate step-specific biases for the prompts, instead of using a single network. Each network learns to encode visual features for a specific step.4. Evaluating the method extensively on a variety of tasks, including image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering. The results demonstrate consistent performance gains across different datasets and tasks, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.5. Conducting ablation studies to validate the benefits of the chaining architecture. The chained prompts and chained Meta-Nets outperform their non-chained counterparts, proving the superiority of modeling step-by-step reasoning.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and effective chain of thought prompt tuning framework to model human-like reasoning process for vision-language tasks. The extensive experiments and ablations validate its effectiveness and superiority.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on vision-language models and prompting:- This paper introduces a novel "chain of thought" prompting method for vision-language models. Other works like CoOp, CoCoOp, and manual prompting mainly use a single prompt, while this proposes chaining prompts together to mimic human reasoning. - The chained prompting approach is adapted from NLP, where chain of thought has shown benefits. This is the first work to successfully apply chained prompting to combine visual and textual embeddings for vision tasks.- The chained prompt tuning framework includes several novel components - chained prompts, chained meta-networks, and a dynamic chain controller. This represents a new architecture for prompting vision-language models.- Experiments demonstrate strong performance on a wide range of vision tasks including classification, retrieval, and VQA. The consistent gains highlight the benefits of chain prompting for better generalization and transferability.- Ablation studies validate the importance of the chain structure itself. Performance drops without chaining prompts or meta-networks. This shows chaining itself, not just added parameters, drives gains.- Compared to learning to explain work which also explores chain of thought for VQA, this work models the image and reasoning steps rather than relying solely on an external image caption context.Overall, this paper makes several notable contributions in adapting chain of thought prompting for vision-language models. The novel architecture and extensive experiments demonstrate the potential of chained prompting to improve these models' reasoning and generalizability.
