# [DexArt: Benchmarking Generalizable Dexterous Manipulation with   Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05706)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the challenge of learning dexterous manipulation policies that can generalize to novel articulated objects. The central hypothesis is that incorporating 3D representation learning into reinforcement learning will allow policies to achieve better generalization performance on unseen articulated objects with high degrees of freedom. Specifically, the paper proposes a new benchmark called DexArt for dexterous manipulation of articulated objects. It then benchmarks different methods, focusing on how different 3D representation learning techniques like point cloud segmentation and reconstruction affect the policy's ability to generalize.The key research questions examined are:- How does training on more diverse objects affect generalization performance to new objects?- How does the architecture size and representation capacity of the visual encoder affect generalization? - Does incorporating object part reasoning through pre-training on part segmentation improve manipulation of articulated objects?- Does learning 3D geometric representations result in more robust policies under viewpoint changes?Through experiments on the DexArt benchmark, the paper provides new insights into these questions, highlighting the importance of 3D representation learning for achieving generalizable policies for dexterous manipulation.
