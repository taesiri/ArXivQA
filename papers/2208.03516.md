# Follow Me: Conversation Planning for Target-driven Recommendation   Dialogue Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research question addressed in this paper is: "How to make reasonable plans to drive the conversation to reach the designated target step by step?"The authors aim to explore how a dialogue system can proactively lead a conversation towards recommending a specific target topic or item to the user. The main challenge is to smoothly guide the conversation through relevant topics to arouse the user's interest in the target, rather than just reactively responding to the user's preferences.The central hypothesis is that explicitly planning a sequence of dialogue actions and topics can help the system strategically transition between different stages of the conversation to achieve the end goal of recommending the target.So in summary, the paper focuses on target-driven conversation planning as a way to enable more natural and proactive recommendation dialogues compared to prior reactive approaches. The key hypothesis is that planning can improve a system's ability to gradually lead users towards accepting a designated recommendation target.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose the task of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems, where the system aims to proactively lead a conversation towards recommending a designated target topic to the user. This pushes the field forward from reactive recommendation systems to proactive ones. 2. The authors propose a Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP) framework to plan appropriate actions and topics to guide the dialogue towards the target recommendation. This includes a target-driven conversation planner model based on Transformer. 3. The TCP framework is used to enhance dialogue generation, by extracting knowledge based on the planned topics and explicitly conditioning the generation on the planned actions.4. Experimental results on the DuRecDial dataset show that TCP significantly improves the performance of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems, in terms of dialogue quality, knowledge generation, and target recommendation success rate.In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of the target-driven recommendation dialogue task and the proposed TCP framework to plan the conversation and guide utterance generation for this new task. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCP for proactive recommendation dialogues.
