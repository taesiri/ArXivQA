# [Follow Me: Conversation Planning for Target-driven Recommendation   Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03516)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research question addressed in this paper is: 

"How to make reasonable plans to drive the conversation to reach the designated target step by step?"

The authors aim to explore how a dialogue system can proactively lead a conversation towards recommending a specific target topic or item to the user. The main challenge is to smoothly guide the conversation through relevant topics to arouse the user's interest in the target, rather than just reactively responding to the user's preferences.

The central hypothesis is that explicitly planning a sequence of dialogue actions and topics can help the system strategically transition between different stages of the conversation to achieve the end goal of recommending the target.

So in summary, the paper focuses on target-driven conversation planning as a way to enable more natural and proactive recommendation dialogues compared to prior reactive approaches. The key hypothesis is that planning can improve a system's ability to gradually lead users towards accepting a designated recommendation target.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose the task of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems, where the system aims to proactively lead a conversation towards recommending a designated target topic to the user. This pushes the field forward from reactive recommendation systems to proactive ones. 

2. The authors propose a Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP) framework to plan appropriate actions and topics to guide the dialogue towards the target recommendation. This includes a target-driven conversation planner model based on Transformer. 

3. The TCP framework is used to enhance dialogue generation, by extracting knowledge based on the planned topics and explicitly conditioning the generation on the planned actions.

4. Experimental results on the DuRecDial dataset show that TCP significantly improves the performance of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems, in terms of dialogue quality, knowledge generation, and target recommendation success rate.

In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of the target-driven recommendation dialogue task and the proposed TCP framework to plan the conversation and guide utterance generation for this new task. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCP for proactive recommendation dialogues.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main point of the paper:

The paper proposes a Target-driven Conversation Planning framework to proactively plan appropriate dialogue actions and topics in order to naturally lead conversations towards recommending designated target items.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in conversational recommendation systems:

- This paper focuses on a new problem formulation called "target-driven recommendation dialogue", where the system is given a specific target item to recommend and must guide the conversation towards recommending it. Most prior work has focused on reactively recommending items based on expressed user preferences.

- The proposed TCP framework plans a path of dialogue actions and topics to proactively lead the user towards accepting the target recommendation. This differentiates from prior multi-task learning models that only predict the next action/topic. 

- The paper introduces a target-driven conversation planner based on Transformers, which leverages the target information during planning. This is a novel model architecture compared to standard Transformer decoders used in prior work.

- For evaluation, existing datasets like GoRecDial and TG-ReDial focus on reactive recommendation conversations. The authors repurpose DuRecDial by automatically creating target items, better serving the new problem setting.

- Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation success rate and dialogue quality over both generative and predict-then-generate baselines. This validates the efficacy of TCP for target-driven conversations.

In summary, this paper pushes forward a new proactive recommendation dialogue problem and proposes a novel planning-based approach tailored to guiding conversations towards target items. The results demonstrate clear benefits over prior reactive models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Investigate how to plan more precisely and guide dialogue generation more effectively. The authors propose the TCP framework for target-driven conversation planning and dialogue generation, but suggest there is room to improve the precision of planning and effectiveness of guiding utterance generation.

- Explore other potential applications and datasets for the target-driven recommendation dialogue task. The authors experiment with a re-purposed version of the DuRecDial dataset, but suggest applying and evaluating their approach on other datasets could be valuable.

- Incorporate user feedback and engagement during the conversation. The current work focuses on planning and generation on the system side, but taking into account real-time user reactions could improve the naturalness and effectiveness. 

- Study personalization and user adaptation over time. The framework relies on a user profile, but further work could be done to enable the system to personalize conversations and adapt to users based on accumulated dialogues.

- Evaluate with human users. The current evaluations are offline metrics-based tests. The authors suggest human evaluations could give further insight into real user experiences with a target-driven recommender system.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out relate to enhancing the planning and generation components, applying the approach to other tasks/datasets, and incorporating more user interaction and personalization over conversations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP) framework for target-driven recommendation dialogue systems. Given a target topic to recommend through the conversation, TCP aims to plan a sequence of dialogue actions and topics to proactively lead the conversation towards the target. Specifically, TCP uses different encoders to obtain representations of the user profile, domain knowledge, and conversation history. Then a target-driven conversation planner based on Transformer is proposed to generate a path consisting of actions and topics in a reversed order from the target to the current turn. The planned path is used to extract relevant knowledge and guide the dialogue generation by taking the last action and topic as a prompt. Experiments on a re-purposed dataset show that TCP significantly improves the performance of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems. TCP helps the system generate more coherent utterances and achieve higher success rates of recommending target topics.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP) for building dialogue systems that can proactively recommend specific target topics or items through natural conversations with users. Previous recommendation dialogue systems have been mainly reactive, responding to user preferences to provide recommendations. However, the paper argues that a proactive approach where the system takes initiative to recommend targets is more useful in many real-world settings. 

The key component in TCP is a transformer-based module that plans a sequence of dialogue actions and topics to gradually lead the conversation towards recommending the target. It takes into account the user profile, domain knowledge, conversation history, and target when planning the path. This planned content is then used to extract relevant knowledge from the domain and guide the utterance generation at each turn. Experiments on a Chinese dataset show that TCP significantly improves the performance of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems across various metrics including target recommendation success rate compared to both general and recommendation dialogue baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of planning and controlling the conversational flow for proactively recommending targets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP) framework for target-driven recommendation dialogue systems. The goal is to proactively lead a conversation towards recommending a target item. The key component is a target-driven conversation planner based on the Transformer architecture. It takes as input the target action/topic, user profile, domain knowledge, and conversation history, and generates a path consisting of a sequence of dialogue actions and topics in a reverse order from the target turn back to the current turn. This planned path is then used to extract relevant knowledge and guide the dialogue generation model to produce appropriate system responses turn-by-turn to engage the user and ultimately recommend the target. The framework aims to plan reasonable dialogue strategies and leverage relevant knowledge to enable smooth topic transitions in order to successfully lead the conversation for target recommendation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question it is addressing is: 

"How to make reasonable plans to drive the conversation to reach the designated target step by step?"

The paper focuses on target-driven recommendation dialogue systems, where the system aims to proactively lead a conversation towards recommending a specific target item (e.g. a movie, music, food, etc.) to the user. This is challenging because the system needs to maintain an engaging conversation, smoothly transition between relevant topics, and arouse the user's interest in the target item. 

Most prior work on recommendation dialogue systems takes a reactive approach - the system responds to the user's preferences to provide recommendations. This paper pushes towards a proactive paradigm by explicitly designating target items and planning the conversation to recommend them appropriately. The core problem is how to naturally guide the conversation towards the target through planning.

So in summary, the key research question is how to create conversational plans that can effectively drive the dialogue to recommend designated target items to users. The paper proposes a target-driven conversation planning framework to address this question.

The core focus of the paper is on "target-driven recommendation dialogue systems", which aim to proactively lead conversations to recommend specific target topics or items to users. The key proposal is the "Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP)" framework to plan sequences of dialogue actions and topics to guide the conversation towards the target. The framework utilizes the user's profile, domain knowledge, and the target topic itself to plan appropriate paths through "dialogue actions" like questions, recommendations etc. and "dialogue topics" like movies, music etc. The planning is done by a Transformer-based model with a "knowledge-target mutual attention" mechanism. The planned actions and topics then guide the final dialogue generation.
