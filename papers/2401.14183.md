# [Towards Autonomous Supply Chains: Definition, Characteristics,   Conceptual Framework, and Autonomy Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Supply chains face increasing disruptions, requiring more resilient and agile alternatives. The concept of autonomous supply chains (ASCs) has emerged but lacks theoretical foundations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides formal definitions and a conceptual framework for ASCs. Key elements include:
  - Formal definition of ASCs as self-governing supply chains built on intelligence and automation. 
  - A 2D autonomy manifold with intelligence and automation dimensions.
  - Six layered characteristics underpinning ASCs.
  - A 5-layer conceptual model called the MIISI model spanning instrumentation to manifestation.
  - A 7-level maturity model assessing supply chain autonomy levels.

- A case study implements an agent-based meat supply chain using the MIISI model.

Main Contributions:  
- Formal definition of ASCs and their structure using newly defined "structural entities".
- 2D autonomy manifold for evaluating entity autonomy.
- Six layered ASC characteristics independent of specific technologies.  
- MIISI - a 5 layer conceptual model for constructing ASC systems.
- Seven supply chain autonomy levels (SCALs) as a maturity model.
- Case study showcasing an initial ASC system implementation guided by the theories.

The paper provides valuable theoretical constructs and principles for continued research into the emerging domain of autonomous supply chains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper formally defines autonomous supply chains, proposes a conceptual framework and maturity model for their development, and demonstrates an initial implementation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Formally proposing a future supply chain model called the Autonomous Supply Chain (ASC), which is a self-governing supply chain requiring minimal or no human intervention.

2. Reviewing the state-of-the-art in ASC conceptual development and proposing a set of auxiliary concepts for conceptualizing ASCs, including internal connection, external connection, tight external connection, and loose external connection. 

3. Providing a formal definition of ASCs and describing their defining characteristics, including a two-dimensional autonomy manifold and six layered characteristics.

4. Presenting a five-layer conceptual model called the MIISI model for constructing an ASC system, consisting of Manifestation, Integration, Interconnection, Standardisation, and Instrumentation layers.

5. Introducing a seven-level supply chain autonomy reference model to assess the autonomy level of an enterprise's supply chain and offer a trajectory towards achieving full supply chain autonomy.  

6. Conducting a case study of implementing an ASC to demonstrate how the proposed theories guide the design of a realistic ASC system.

In summary, the main contribution is formally defining the ASC concept and proposing theoretical frameworks to guide the development of ASC systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a formal definition of an Autonomous Supply Chain (ASC). How does this definition differentiate an ASC from traditional supply chains? What are the key elements in the definition?

2. The paper introduces the concept of a "structural entity." What role do structural entities play in an ASC? Why are they an important concept? 

3. The two-dimensional autonomy manifold is presented with four regions. Can you explain what each region represents and why achieving balance between the two dimensions is important?

4. The six layered characteristics underpinning an ASC are introduced. Can you briefly describe each characteristic and how they relate to each other in a layered structure? 

5. The MIISI conceptual model stratifies an ASC into five abstract layers. What is the overarching function of each layer? How do the layers connect and build upon each other?

6. What are the key differences between the three types of external connections - ad hoc, temporary, established - in the context of an ASC? What considerations might be necessary for each type?

7. The seven Supply Chain Autonomy Levels (SCALs) delineate the trajectory towards full autonomy. Can you explain the distinction between the automation and autonomisation phases? What changes as the autonomy level increases?

8. In the case study, what approach was used to implement the example ASC system? How does this approach connect distributed supply chain entities? 

9. How does the implemented system in the case study map to the five layers in the MIISI conceptual model? In what layers is it lacking?

10. What are some additional technological and managerial considerations and challenges that need to be addressed for advancing the ASC agenda, as discussed in the paper?
