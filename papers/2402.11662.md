# [TDE-3: An improved prior for optical flow computation in spiking neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11662)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical two-point Time Difference Encoder (TDE-2) loses direction selectivity in textured environments due to residual activity in the gain compartment. This makes it unsuitable for precise optical flow estimation required for vision-based navigation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a 3-point TDE (TDE-3) with an additional inhibitory input that resets the gain and removes residual activity, preserving direction selectivity of individual TDEs.

- Develop training procedure using backpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to map input velocities into TDE-3 output spike count or interspike interval. First demonstration of training a spiking neuron to have a specific interspike interval.

- Compare spike count vs interspike interval for inference robustness to spatial frequency changes and noise.

Main Contributions:  

1) Presentation of a more robust TDE-3 and demonstration of its improved direction selectivity over TDE-2

2) Pipeline for supervised training of TDEs to linearly encode velocity into spike outputs, including a novel method to train for specific interspike intervals  

3) First in-depth analysis of optical flow coding comparing spike count vs interspike interval, evaluating robustness to spatial frequency and noise

4) First quantitative characterization of optical flow coding precision and energy efficiency with TDEs on real-world data. TDE-3 network spikes less and is more efficient. Both TDE-2 and TDE-3 achieve ~20 degree angular error in direction, comparable to model-based methods.

In summary, the paper presents TDE-3 as an improved computational primitive for energy-efficient and precise optical flow estimation from event-based sensors, compatible with spike-based neuromorphic hardware.
