# [TDE-3: An improved prior for optical flow computation in spiking neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11662)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical two-point Time Difference Encoder (TDE-2) loses direction selectivity in textured environments due to residual activity in the gain compartment. This makes it unsuitable for precise optical flow estimation required for vision-based navigation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a 3-point TDE (TDE-3) with an additional inhibitory input that resets the gain and removes residual activity, preserving direction selectivity of individual TDEs.

- Develop training procedure using backpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to map input velocities into TDE-3 output spike count or interspike interval. First demonstration of training a spiking neuron to have a specific interspike interval.

- Compare spike count vs interspike interval for inference robustness to spatial frequency changes and noise.

Main Contributions:  

1) Presentation of a more robust TDE-3 and demonstration of its improved direction selectivity over TDE-2

2) Pipeline for supervised training of TDEs to linearly encode velocity into spike outputs, including a novel method to train for specific interspike intervals  

3) First in-depth analysis of optical flow coding comparing spike count vs interspike interval, evaluating robustness to spatial frequency and noise

4) First quantitative characterization of optical flow coding precision and energy efficiency with TDEs on real-world data. TDE-3 network spikes less and is more efficient. Both TDE-2 and TDE-3 achieve ~20 degree angular error in direction, comparable to model-based methods.

In summary, the paper presents TDE-3 as an improved computational primitive for energy-efficient and precise optical flow estimation from event-based sensors, compatible with spike-based neuromorphic hardware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an augmented 3-point time difference encoder (TDE) for optical flow estimation in spiking neural networks using event cameras, demonstrates its ability to be trained to linearly encode input velocity information, compares spike count and inter-spike interval coding strategies, and evaluates performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting a novel augmented 3-point TDE (TDE-3) detector that has more robust direction selectivity compared to the classical 2-point TDE (TDE-2) in textured environments. This is achieved by adding an inhibitory input to reset residual activity.

2. Developing a training pipeline using backpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to map input velocities linearly into TDE output spike count or interspike interval (ISI). This includes the first attempt at training a spiking neuron to have a specific ISI.  

3. Comparing spike count and ISI-based inference for TDE velocity coding. Results show ISI is more robust to spatial frequency changes while spike count is more reliable for training in noisy conditions.  

4. Providing the first quantitative analysis of TDE coding precision and efficiency for real-world optical flow estimation. TDE-3 is shown to be more efficient (requires fewer spikes) than TDE-2 while both can estimate flow directions to within ~20 degrees error.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an improved TDE design and thorough investigation of its capabilities for optical flow estimation from event-based sensors, with analysis on multiple levels from single detectors to inference on real-world data.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:
