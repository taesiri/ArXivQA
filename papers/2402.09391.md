# [LlaSMol: Advancing Large Language Models for Chemistry with a   Large-Scale, Comprehensive, High-Quality Instruction Tuning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chemistry plays a vital role in domains like drug discovery and materials science, but existing large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on chemistry tasks compared to task-specific models. 
- Prior work showed LLMs like GPT-4 have limited capabilities on chemistry problems. This raises questions on whether LLMs can effectively perform chemistry tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops LLMs named LlaSMol by fine-tuning base models like Mistral on a large-scale instruction tuning dataset called SMolInstruct.
- SMolInstruct covers 14 meaningful chemistry tasks with over 3 million high-quality samples. Tasks include name conversion, property prediction, molecule description, and chemical reactions.
- Rigorous data processing ensured the quality and diversity of the dataset. Careful split prevented data leakage across tasks.  

Key Contributions:
- LlaSMol models achieve substantially better performance than GPT-4 and base models across all tasks, showcasing the dataset's effectiveness.
- Among LlaSMol models, Mistral-based one performs the best, indicating Mistral's potential for chemistry.
- With only 0.59% parameters tuned, LlaSMol approaches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific models on several tasks. More extensive tuning could enable surpassing them.
- The results demonstrate LLMs have immense potential to effectively perform chemistry tasks. LlaSMol can serve as strong foundation models for chemistry.

In summary, the paper develops high-quality instruction tuning data and LLMs to significantly improve LLMs' performance on diverse chemistry tasks, underscoring their potential as chemistry foundation models.
