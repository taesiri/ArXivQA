# [Embodied Multi-Modal Agent trained by an LLM from a Parallel TextWorld](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16714)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for training an embodied multi-modal agent (EMMA) to interact with visual environments by imitating an expert language model (LLM) operating in a parallel text-based world. The key idea is to leverage the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs to provide improved actions and feedback for finetuning the visual-language model (VLM) backbone of EMMA. Specifically, at each step, the visual observation is converted into text to query the LLM expert, composed of an actor to give actions and a critic to provide retrospective analysis on the agent's past trajectories. This helps address challenges like sparse rewards, noisy perceptions, and misaligned representations. Through interactive cross-modality imitation learning based on DAgger and direct preference optimization (DPO), EMMA achieves significantly higher task success rates and better generalization compared to state-of-the-art VLM agents in the ALFWorld benchmark. The proposed framework enables transferring skills from powerful yet inaccessible LLMs to train performant embodied agents interacting directly with visual environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes training an embodied multi-modal agent (EMMA) in a visual world by imitating an LLM expert in a parallel text world, enabling EMMA to efficiently adapt to the visual world dynamics and generalize to diverse tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method to train an Embodied Multi-Modal Agent (EMMA) to interact with a visual world by imitating an LLM expert operating in a parallel text world. Specifically:

1) They propose cross-modality imitation learning between a VLM agent (EMMA) in a visual world and an LLM expert in a parallel text world constructed using the textual descriptions of visual observations. This allows the VLM agent to leverage the reasoning and planning capabilities of the LLM expert.

2) The LLM expert is composed of an actor to provide actions and a critic to give retrospective feedback on the VLM's trajectories. This helps provide better teaching signals to the VLM agent. 

3) They show that the resulting agent, EMMA, substantially outperforms prior VLM agents and achieves comparable performance to LLM agents operating in the perfect text world. It also shows better robustness to noise and better generalization capabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is using cross-modality imitation learning to train an embodied VLM agent by distilling skills from an LLM expert in a parallel text world, allowing it to surpass prior VLM agents.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes training an embodied agent called EMMA in a visual world by imitating an LLM expert from a parallel text world. Why is directly training EMMA using reinforcement learning from environmental rewards challenging? What are the key issues it aims to address?

2. The paper converts visual observations to equivalent textual descriptions to enable querying an LLM expert. What are the potential limitations of this conversion process? How might it impact the quality of expert guidance? 

3. The LLM expert is composed of an actor to generate actions and a critic to provide retrospective feedback. Why is such a dual structure useful compared to just using an LLM actor? How does the critic aid the actor?

4. The paper finetunes EMMA using an interactive imitation learning algorithm based on DAgger. What are the key advantages of this algorithm over standard behavior cloning? How does it aim to overcome issues like distribution shift?

5. The loss function for imitation learning is based on direct preference optimization (DPO) rather than cross-entropy. What is the intuition behind using DPO? What benefits does it offer over cross-entropy in this setting?

6. The paper conducts an ablation study analyzing the impact of behavior cloning initialization. Why is this initialization useful? What drop in performance is observed when it is removed?

7. Another ablation evaluates replacing DPO loss with cross-entropy loss. What difference in convergence behavior and final performance was observed? What may explain this?

8. What were the key findings from the comparison between EMMA and Reflexion in terms of robustness to noise? Why may VLM agents demonstrate greater robustness?  

9. The paper shows EMMA generalizes substantially better to free-form instructions compared to other VLM agents. Why does this highlight regarding the benefits of distilling LLM capabilities?

10. What potential ways are discussed to further enhance EMMA's performance? What promising future directions are outlined to make use of LLM guidance for training embodied agents?
