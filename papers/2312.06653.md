# [Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for adaptive human trajectory prediction, where a pre-trained predictor model is efficiently adapted over time to changing real-world scenes. The key idea is to augment the input of the frozen pre-trained predictor with lightweight learnable image prompts called "latent corridors," which guide the model to understand scene-specific human navigation patterns. Both simulated and real-world pedestrian datasets are used in experiments. Results show that with minimal additional parameters, adapting trajectory predictors via latent corridors enables significant quantitative improvements in prediction accuracy compared to non-adaptive baselines, especially as more scene-specific adaptation data is observed over time. Qualitative results also demonstrate that latent corridors inject awareness of 3D scene geometry as well as transient human behaviors like avoiding obstacles or following subtle walking paths. The method is compatible with various deployment constraints through prompt tuning strategies like per-scene finetuning or joint finetuning. This intuitive and flexible approach paves the way for trajectory predictors that can continually adapt to changes in the visual world.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adaptive trajectory prediction method called latent corridors, which efficiently adapts pre-trained predictors to observed human behavior in deployment scenes by learning lightweight image prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Formalizing the adaptive trajectory prediction problem: The paper formally defines the problem of adapting pre-trained human trajectory predictors to changing conditions and events in a deployment scene over time.

2. Proposing a novel adaptation method called "latent corridors": The paper proposes a new approach for efficient adaptation inspired by prompt tuning, where lightweight image prompts called "latent corridors" are introduced and tuned on new deployment data while keeping most of the base predictor frozen.

3. Demonstrating quantitative and qualitative improvements: The paper shows both numerically and visually that learning latent corridors enables more accurate trajectory predictions, with up to 23.9% lower error compared to non-adaptive predictors on simulated data and 16.4% lower error on real pedestrian data.

So in summary, the main contribution is formalizing, proposing a method for, and demonstrating the value of adaptive trajectory prediction via efficient tuning of latent corridors. The key ideas are adapting predictors over time to capture changing real-world conditions, doing so efficiently via prompting, and showing this achieves better performance.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Adaptive trajectory prediction - The problem of adapting pre-trained human trajectory predictors to changing conditions and environments over time. The main focus of the paper.

- Latent corridors - The proposed method for adaptation, which involves augmenting the input to the predictor with learnable image prompts that capture scene-specific behavior trends.

- Prompt tuning - The latent corridors take inspiration from prompt tuning approaches in language models, using small trainable inputs to specialize a model. 

- Heatmaps - The paper represents trajectories as heatmaps instead of coordinate points, allowing the model to reason in image space.

- Deployment scene - The scene/environment that a pre-trained predictor gets adapted to after training. Exhibits changing conditions over time.

- Human seconds - The metric used to quantify the amount of adaptation data, calculated as number of humans x time observed.

- Multimodality - Modeling multiple possible future trajectory predictions, though not a focus of this work.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning "latent corridors" to adapt trajectory predictors. What is the intuition behind calling these learnable prompts "latent corridors"? How do they conceptually guide predictions?

2. The latent corridors are represented as a low-rank matrix derived from an outer product of two vectors. What is the motivation behind using this compact representation instead of a full-sized image prompt? How does it help with more efficient learning?

3. The paper experiments with different variants of tuning the prediction head jointly or individually per scene along with the latent corridors. What are the tradeoffs between these different configurations? When would one choose one configuration over the other?

4. How exactly are the latent corridors incorporated into the input pipeline of the trajectory predictor? What ablations did the authors perform regarding where to inject the prompt?

5. The method relies on a pre-trained trajectory predictor. What are the key aspects or capabilities that this base predictor must have for the latent corridors approach to be effective?

6. The experiments show improved quantitative results but more dramatic qualitative improvements in terms of grounding behavior and learning scene specifics. Why does this difference exist? What challenges remain in effectively evaluating trajectory predictors?

7. The paper demonstrates sim-to-real transfer by pre-training only on MOTSynth then adapting to MOT and Wildtrack scenes. What factors make this challenging and why does their method succeed at this?

8. How does the amount of adaptation data provided influence what is learned in the latent corridors? Could prompts overfit to small datasets instead of learning meaningful scene-specific guidance?

9. The method learns a unique prompt per scene. In practice, could prompts be shared across similar scenes? What challenges would arise with scaling to adapt to many deployment scenes? 

10. The adaptation approach focuses on pedestrian trajectory prediction. What considerations would adapting this approach to other prediction domains (e.g. vehicles) require? What components would transfer and what would need to change?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors":

Problem: 
Existing methods for human trajectory prediction make the fundamental assumption that human behavior patterns are constant over time within a scene. However, in the real world, context and human behavior inevitably change over time (e.g. new obstacles/entrances, changes in pedestrian flows). Current prediction models fail to adapt to such transient events.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel approach called "latent corridors" to efficiently adapt pre-trained trajectory predictors to observed human behavior changes within a scene over time. The key idea is to augment the input of any pre-trained predictor with learnable image prompts (called latent corridors). One unique prompt is introduced per scene. Most of the base predictor stays frozen, while only the prompts are tuned on new observed trajectory data from the scene to capture updated behavioral trends.

Contributions:
1) Formalizes the problem of adaptive human trajectory prediction
2) Proposes a lightweight adaptation approach using latent corridors (learnable image prompts) that improves prediction accuracy with minimal parameter increase (<0.1%)
3) Shows quantitative improvements up to 23.9% in synthetic data and 16.4% in real data over non-adaptive baselines
4) Demonstrates that the approach learns scene-specific information like new obstacles, entrances, pedestrian flows, and injects awareness of 3D scene geometry from just a few seconds of new observations

In summary, this paper presents an efficient way to adapt existing trajectory predictors to changing real-world scenes over time without requiring much new data or model re-training. The latent corridors capture updated behavioral and geometrical cues to improve prediction accuracy as more data is observed.
