# [Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for adaptive human trajectory prediction, where a pre-trained predictor model is efficiently adapted over time to changing real-world scenes. The key idea is to augment the input of the frozen pre-trained predictor with lightweight learnable image prompts called "latent corridors," which guide the model to understand scene-specific human navigation patterns. Both simulated and real-world pedestrian datasets are used in experiments. Results show that with minimal additional parameters, adapting trajectory predictors via latent corridors enables significant quantitative improvements in prediction accuracy compared to non-adaptive baselines, especially as more scene-specific adaptation data is observed over time. Qualitative results also demonstrate that latent corridors inject awareness of 3D scene geometry as well as transient human behaviors like avoiding obstacles or following subtle walking paths. The method is compatible with various deployment constraints through prompt tuning strategies like per-scene finetuning or joint finetuning. This intuitive and flexible approach paves the way for trajectory predictors that can continually adapt to changes in the visual world.
