# [NLPre: a revised approach towards language-centric benchmarking of   Natural Language Preprocessing systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating natural language preprocessing (NLPre) tools is challenging due to discrepancies in tagsets, datasets, and lack of centralized platforms to track progress. 
- Existing evaluation methods like shared tasks, performance tables, and progress repositories have limitations in keeping updated rankings, enabling cross-system comparisons, considering all systems, avoiding result manipulation and taking a language-centric perspective.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel language-oriented benchmarking approach to evaluate and rank NLPre systems using a public leaderboard.
- An online benchmarking system is implemented that automatically evaluates submitted NLPre predictions on held-out test sets and publishes performance rankings.
- The system is language-centric, tagset-agnostic, provides comprehensive and credible evaluation, and constitutes an up-to-date NLPre progress tracking.

Implementation and Contributions:
- A prototype benchmarking system is configured for Polish (NLPre-PL) with reformulated datasets and tasks. Extensive experiments compare neural and non-neural NLPre tools.
- To demonstrate multi-lingual capabilities, benchmarking systems are implemented for Irish (NLPre-GA) and Chinese (NLPre-ZH). 
- The system's source code is released as open-source. Guidelines are provided to configure new benchmarks for other languages.

Key outcomes:
- Modern neural architectures obtain better NLPre performance than non-neural tools. Tagset selection does not majorly affect results.
- Larger training data leads to better performance - a 6.21 average F1 point difference observed.
- The benchmarking system allows reliable, up-to-date and language-specific evaluations and progress tracking of NLPre tools.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel language-centric benchmarking approach for evaluating and ranking natural language preprocessing (NLPre) systems, applies it to Polish by assembling the NLPre-PL benchmark, and conducts an empirical comparison of various NLPre tools for Polish using this benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel language-oriented benchmarking approach to evaluate and rank natural language preprocessing (NLPre) systems. 

2. Conducting a scientific evaluation of the proposed benchmarking approach for Polish, including assembling the NLPre-PL benchmark and using it to evaluate various NLPre systems.

3. Releasing online benchmarking platforms for three languages (Polish, Chinese, Irish) and the full source code of the benchmarking system to facilitate adoption for other languages.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a new benchmarking methodology tailored for NLPre tasks and demonstrating its utility through a case study on Polish along with releasing the necessary resources to apply this methodology to other languages. The key aspects are enabling standardized evaluation and tracking progress of NLPre systems in a language-specific context.

The paper proposes a new language-oriented benchmarking approach to evaluate and rank natural language preprocessing (NLPre) systems. It introduces NLPre-PL, a new performance benchmark for Polish, and uses it to conduct an extensive comparison of different types of NLPre systems. The key focus is on benchmarking and credible evaluation of segmentation, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and other preliminary NLP tasks handled by NLPre tools.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed NLPre benchmarking approach differ from existing NLPre evaluation methods like shared tasks or progress repositories? What are the key advantages it offers?

2. The paper mentions configuring the benchmarking system for other languages. What would be the main challenges in setting up such systems for morphologically complex or low-resource languages? 

3. The paper evaluates both neural and non-neural systems. Based on the results, what conclusions can be drawn about the impact of system architecture on NLPre performance?

4. What was the motivation behind formulating two different data splits (byName and byType) for the NKJP corpus? How did using these splits affect the overall results?

5. The paper benchmarks multiple systems including Stanza, SpaCy, Trankit etc. Can you analyze the relative strengths and weaknesses of these systems for Polish NLPre tasks based on the results?

6. How suitable do you think the proposed benchmarking approach would be for highly multilingual NLPre systems? What modifications might be needed?

7. What additional experiments could be conducted with the NLPre systems to further analyze the impact of factors like tagset selection and training data size?  

8. The paper does not compare training times of systems. How could this metric be incorporated into the benchmarking approach in a fair manner?

9. The correlation analysis reveals high correlation between system performance across tasks and tags. What implications does this have for NLPre system development?

10. The paper mentions self-hosting benchmarking systems for a language. What would be the practical benefits and challenges in adopting such localized systems?
