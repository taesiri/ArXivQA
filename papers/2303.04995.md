# [Text-Visual Prompting for Efficient 2D Temporal Video Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04995)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is:

How to advance 2D video temporal grounding (TVG) methods to achieve comparable performance to 3D TVG methods in a more efficient manner?

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework to boost the performance of 2D TVG models by incorporating optimized perturbation patterns (prompts) into both visual inputs and textual features. The goal is to compensate for the lack of spatiotemporal information in sparse 2D visual features and improve cross-modal feature fusion, without needing costly dense 3D features. The central hypothesis is that TVP allows effective co-training of vision and language encoders in a 2D TVG model to approach the accuracy of 3D methods while being much more efficient.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving 2D TVG to be on par with 3D methods that rely on expensive 3D features, via a new TVP technique for incorporating optimized prompts into both visual and textual inputs. The aim is to develop an efficient yet accurate 2D alternative to existing 3D TVG models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework for efficient 2D temporal video grounding (TVG). The TVP framework incorporates optimized perturbation patterns (prompts) into both visual inputs and textual features to improve the performance of 2D TVG models that use only sparse 2D visual features extracted by a trainable 2D CNN. 

2. It develops a Temporal-Distance IoU (TDIoU) loss for efficient training of the TVP framework. The TDIoU loss incorporates distance loss and duration loss to provide more precise supervision compared to just using temporal IoU loss.

3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance for 2D TVG methods on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets. The TVP framework outperforms prior 2D TVG methods by a large margin and achieves comparable performance to more complex 3D TVG methods that use dense 3D visual features.

4. It demonstrates significant inference speedup (~5x) compared to 3D TVG methods by using only sparse 2D visual features from a compact 2D CNN. This makes the approach more practical for real-world applications.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an efficient 2D TVG framework using text-visual prompting that achieves strong performance compared to prior 2D and 3D methods while being much faster computationally. The TVP framework allows high-accuracy 2D TVG with low complexity and cost.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main contribution of this CVPR 2023 paper:

This paper proposes a text-visual prompting framework for efficient 2D temporal video grounding that achieves comparable performance to 3D methods while using only sparse 2D visual features for 5x faster inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in temporal video grounding:

- This paper focuses on improving performance of 2D models for temporal video grounding, while much prior work uses more complex 3D models. Using a 2D model allows for faster and more efficient inference compared to 3D models.

- The main contribution is proposing a text-visual prompting (TVP) framework that incorporates optimized prompt patterns into the visual and textual inputs. This is a novel way to compensate for the lack of spatiotemporal context in sparse 2D visual features. 

- Most prior work uses offline pretrained 3D models like C3D or I3D to extract dense video features. This paper trains the 2D model end-to-end with the prompts, allowing for co-training of the vision and language encoders.

- The TVP framework achieves strong performance on par with 3D models on Charades-STA and ActivityNet datasets, while being much more efficient. For example, it achieves a 30.77% boost on ActivityNet while having 5x faster inference than 3D models.

- The paper proposes a new TDIoU loss incorporating distance and duration terms, which helps with more precise supervision compared to just using temporal IoU.

- Overall, this paper makes temporal video grounding more practical by developing an efficient 2D framework that rivals the performance of complex 3D models. The text-visual prompting technique is novel in compensating for the lack of spatiotemporal context in 2D models.

In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in 2D models for temporal video grounding through an innovative text-visual prompting framework and training approach. The gains in efficiency and performance over 3D models are noteworthy.
