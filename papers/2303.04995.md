# [Text-Visual Prompting for Efficient 2D Temporal Video Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04995)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is:

How to advance 2D video temporal grounding (TVG) methods to achieve comparable performance to 3D TVG methods in a more efficient manner?

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework to boost the performance of 2D TVG models by incorporating optimized perturbation patterns (prompts) into both visual inputs and textual features. The goal is to compensate for the lack of spatiotemporal information in sparse 2D visual features and improve cross-modal feature fusion, without needing costly dense 3D features. The central hypothesis is that TVP allows effective co-training of vision and language encoders in a 2D TVG model to approach the accuracy of 3D methods while being much more efficient.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving 2D TVG to be on par with 3D methods that rely on expensive 3D features, via a new TVP technique for incorporating optimized prompts into both visual and textual inputs. The aim is to develop an efficient yet accurate 2D alternative to existing 3D TVG models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework for efficient 2D temporal video grounding (TVG). The TVP framework incorporates optimized perturbation patterns (prompts) into both visual inputs and textual features to improve the performance of 2D TVG models that use only sparse 2D visual features extracted by a trainable 2D CNN. 

2. It develops a Temporal-Distance IoU (TDIoU) loss for efficient training of the TVP framework. The TDIoU loss incorporates distance loss and duration loss to provide more precise supervision compared to just using temporal IoU loss.

3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance for 2D TVG methods on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets. The TVP framework outperforms prior 2D TVG methods by a large margin and achieves comparable performance to more complex 3D TVG methods that use dense 3D visual features.

4. It demonstrates significant inference speedup (~5x) compared to 3D TVG methods by using only sparse 2D visual features from a compact 2D CNN. This makes the approach more practical for real-world applications.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an efficient 2D TVG framework using text-visual prompting that achieves strong performance compared to prior 2D and 3D methods while being much faster computationally. The TVP framework allows high-accuracy 2D TVG with low complexity and cost.
