# [Leveraging Representations from Intermediate Encoder-blocks for   Synthetic Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advances in generative models like GANs and Diffusion models have enabled the creation of extremely realistic fake images, making it challenging to reliably detect them. Prior works have shown that features from foundation models like CLIP are effective for synthetic image detection (SID), but primarily leverage high-level semantic features from the last layer rather than low-level visual features from intermediate layers that capture finer details more useful for SID. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a model called RINE that leverages Representations from Intermediate Encoder blocks of CLIP's image encoder. RINE extracts features from the CLS tokens of each Transformer block, projects them to a forgery-aware space using a lightweight network, and averages them using learned importance weights per block and feature via a Trainable Importance Estimator (TIE). This allows effectively incorporating both high-level and low-level representations.

Contributions:
- RINE surpasses state-of-the-art methods by +10.6% average accuracy and +4.5% mAP over 20 test datasets encompassing various generators, using only 1 epoch of training.
- Ablations show the intermediate representations provide the biggest boost, increasing metrics to state-of-the-art levels when removed.
- RINE exhibits strong generalization even when trained on just a single object class, unlike prior works requiring more classes.
- The method is robust to perturbations like blurring, cropping, compression etc. that are common while sharing images online.
- Analysis of TIE's importance weights validates the motivation to leverage intermediate blocks rather than just the last layer.

In summary, RINE pushes SID performance further by effectively incorporating representations from intermediate layers of foundation models, with little training data or compute requirements. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance and robustness.
