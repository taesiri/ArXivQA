# [SC-GlowTTS: an Efficient Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker Text-To-Speech Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05557)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we develop an efficient zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech model that improves similarity for speakers unseen during training?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a novel zero-shot multi-speaker TTS approach called SC-GlowTTS. 

- It explores using a flow-based decoder architecture that enables zero-shot learning of new voices.

- The model uses speaker embeddings from an external speaker encoder to condition the synthesis and enable new voices.

- The central hypothesis seems to be that this proposed model architecture and training approach will allow improving similarity to new speakers not seen during training, while remaining efficient.

- Experiments compare against a Tacotron 2 baseline and show state-of-the-art results for similarity using only 11 speakers, while being faster than real-time.

- Adjusting the vocoder to the TTS model is also shown to significantly improve similarity and quality.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop an efficient zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model that improves similarity to new voices, which the proposed SC-GlowTTS approach aims to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes SC-GlowTTS, a novel zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech model that improves similarity for speakers unseen during training. The main contributions are:

- A speaker-conditional architecture that explores different text encoders and a flow-based decoder for zero-shot TTS.

- Showing that adjusting a GAN-based vocoder using spectrograms from the TTS model significantly improves similarity and speech quality for new speakers. 

- The model achieves state-of-the-art results with just 11 speakers in the training set.

- The resulting system enables high quality and faster than real-time speech synthesis in the zero-shot multi-speaker setting.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting SC-GlowTTS, a novel and efficient zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model that reaches state-of-the-art performance in similarity for unseen speakers and speech quality using only a few speakers in training. The proposed techniques, like vocoder fine-tuning and the speaker-conditional architecture, help achieve these results.
