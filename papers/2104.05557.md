## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the SC-GlowTTS model to a few-shot approach, where multiple reference samples are used for each speaker. This could further improve similarity for unseen speakers. 

- Exploring the ability to manipulate speech aspects like pitch, tone, rate, cadence, and accent using the flow-based decoder architecture.

- Investigating whether training the models in a speaker-dependent scenario leads to improved similarity for novel speakers, as suggested by prior work on Tacotron 2. 

- Applying and evaluating the model on low-resource languages, since it can converge with much less speaker data.

- Comparing different encoder architectures like convolutional and transformer networks to see if further improvements can be made.

- Incorporating emerging losses like Prosody Nearest Neighbors loss to improve prosody modeling.

- Extending the model to a full end-to-end setup without the need for an external speaker encoder.

Overall, the main suggestions are around improving speaker similarity in few-shot and low-resource settings, manipulating and improving prosody, comparing encoder architectures, and moving to a fully end-to-end model. The flow-based decoder presents opportunities for novel speech manipulations as well.
