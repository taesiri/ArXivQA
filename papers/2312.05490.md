# [Shapley Values-enabled Progressive Pseudo Bag Augmentation for Whole   Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05490)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Whole slide image (WSI) classification is challenging due to the gigapixel resolution and limited fine-grained labels. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a useful weakly supervised approach but has issues with extreme attention distributions and inaccurate ranking of positive instances.

- Existing MIL methods use attention scores to estimate instance importance scores (IIS). However, attention scores lead to skewed distributions and fail to reliably identify the most crucial positive instances.

Solution: 
- Propose using Shapley values instead of attention scores to quantify each instance's contribution and better estimate IIS. The exponential complexity of computing Shapley values is reduced for efficiency.

- Introduce a framework called PMIL that utilizes the improved IIS estimates to progressively assign instances into pseudo bags during training. This encourages more balanced attention and reduces mislabeled instances.  

- Apply an expectation-maximization algorithm to iteratively optimize the assignment of instances into pseudo bags. The number of pseudo bags also progressively increases during training.

Main Contributions:
- First work to employ Shapley values for IIS estimation in MIL, enhancing instance ranking accuracy and interpretability compared to attention scores.

- Propose progressive pseudo bag augmentation approach guided by Shapley-based IIS to reduce attention skew and mislabeled instances.

- Extensive experiments on 3 WSI datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method also enables valuable class-wise visual interpretations.

- Analysis provides insights into selecting appropriate IIS metrics based on dataset complexity, determining maximum pseudo bags given positive instances per bag, and efficacy of progressive strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a progressive pseudo bag augmented multiple instance learning framework for whole slide image classification that incorporates Shapley value-based instance importance scores and the expectation-maximization algorithm to systematically improve pseudo bag augmentation and significantly enhance MIL performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the Shapley value to estimate instance importance scores (IIS) for the first time in the context of multiple instance learning. This provides a more accurate measure of each instance's contribution compared to using attention scores. 

2. It proposes a progressive pseudo bag augmented multiple instance learning (MIL) framework called PMIL. This incorporates the Shapley value-based IIS to systematically improve pseudo bag assignment, enhancing MIL model performance and reducing mislabeling issues.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on three public datasets - CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG. Results show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, the Shapley value-based IIS enables valuable class-wise interpretability.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a progressive pseudo bag augmented MIL framework that leverages Shapley values to estimate IIS. This advances MIL techniques for whole slide image classification.

The paper focuses on improving MIL for WSI classification by addressing issues with attention-based MIL methods. It introduces using Shapley values to estimate instance importance scores instead of attention scores. It also proposes a progressive pseudo bag augmentation framework called PMIL that assigns instances to pseudo bags based on their IIS. The EM algorithm is used to optimize pseudo bag label assignment during training. Experiments on medical imaging datasets demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art MIL techniques.

In summary, the key ideas involve using game theory concepts like Shapley values for better instance ranking, progressive pseudo bagging to enhance diversity, and EM to reduce mislabeled instances. The goal is to enhance MIL interpretability and accuracy for pathological WSI classification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using the Shapley value to quantify the contribution of each instance for estimating instance importance scores (IIS). How exactly is the Shapley value computation accelerated in the context of multiple instance learning where each bag contains thousands of instances? What approximations or assumptions are made?

2. In the progressive pseudo bag augmentation framework, how is the optimization problem formulated to minimize the number of incorrectly assigned pseudo bag labels? Explain the connection made to the Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence.  

3. The method incorporates the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for optimizing the pseudo bag label assignment. Elaborate on how the E-step and M-step are realized in this context. What objective function is optimized in the M-step?

4. Explain why directly calculating the Shapley value for IIS estimation has exponential complexity and how the proposed approximation reduces it to linear complexity. What parameters control the efficiency vs accuracy trade-off?  

5. The number of pseudo bags is increased progressively once the MIL model converges during training. What indicators are used to determine MIL model convergence? How is the subsequent increment in the number of pseudo bags determined?

6. How exactly are the instances rearranged within each bag according to the ranking of IIS for pseudo bag assignment? Illustrate with an example bag containing both positive and negative instances.

7. One of the major challenges highlighted is the extreme distribution of attention scores. Analyze why existing MIL methods result in skewed attention distributions and how progressive pseudo bag augmentation alleviates this.  

8. Explain the sensitivity analysis conducted regarding the maximum pseudo bag number. What factors determine the optimal value across datasets? How is this value affected by the prevalence of micro vs macro metastasis? 

9. Compare the effectiveness of attention score vs Shapley value for IIS estimation across different datasets. When does one metric perform better than the other? Justify based on the classifier robustness.

10. The method offers class-wise interpretability using Shapley values which is not possible with attention scores. Elaborate on how the Shapley value computation, leveraging the full MIL classifier, enables this. Provide examples of class-wise heatmaps.
