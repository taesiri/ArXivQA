# [Shapley Values-enabled Progressive Pseudo Bag Augmentation for Whole   Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05490)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Whole slide image (WSI) classification is challenging due to the gigapixel resolution and limited fine-grained labels. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a useful weakly supervised approach but has issues with extreme attention distributions and inaccurate ranking of positive instances.

- Existing MIL methods use attention scores to estimate instance importance scores (IIS). However, attention scores lead to skewed distributions and fail to reliably identify the most crucial positive instances.

Solution: 
- Propose using Shapley values instead of attention scores to quantify each instance's contribution and better estimate IIS. The exponential complexity of computing Shapley values is reduced for efficiency.

- Introduce a framework called PMIL that utilizes the improved IIS estimates to progressively assign instances into pseudo bags during training. This encourages more balanced attention and reduces mislabeled instances.  

- Apply an expectation-maximization algorithm to iteratively optimize the assignment of instances into pseudo bags. The number of pseudo bags also progressively increases during training.

Main Contributions:
- First work to employ Shapley values for IIS estimation in MIL, enhancing instance ranking accuracy and interpretability compared to attention scores.

- Propose progressive pseudo bag augmentation approach guided by Shapley-based IIS to reduce attention skew and mislabeled instances.

- Extensive experiments on 3 WSI datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method also enables valuable class-wise visual interpretations.

- Analysis provides insights into selecting appropriate IIS metrics based on dataset complexity, determining maximum pseudo bags given positive instances per bag, and efficacy of progressive strategies.
