# [Effort and Size Estimation in Software Projects with Large Language   Model-based Intelligent Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have enabled more flexible and accessible software design through natural language interfaces. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of imprecise specifications, making it very difficult to estimate development effort and size.

- Traditional software design with explicit user stories allowed for clear documentation of required data sources, algorithms, and UI components. This enabled reasonable estimates of implementation complexity.

- With LLM interfaces, simply describing desired user interactions in natural language makes it hard to quantify the backend needs. Overusing the adaptive capabilities of LLMs causes deterioration of specification quality.

Solution:
- Leverage the `Planner` component of AI Agents to systematically enumerate the data sources, algorithms, and UI components needed to support various user interactions. 

- Iterate through generating related questions that the system should handle, and use the Planner to determine the minimally needed backend tools (optimized set of data sources, algorithms, UI items)

- This regains the specification precision previously achieved with explicit user stories, enabling effort estimation. Also documents what the system will and won't do.

Main Contributions:
- Identified the challenge of effort estimation for software projects with LLM user interfaces
- Proposed a solution to regenerate backend specificity by utilizing the Planner module of AI Agents
- Provided an algorithm to iterate through user questions and extract a minimized set of required data sources, algorithms, and UI components
- Showed an example of applying the technique to quantify the backend needs for a pizza ordering application

The key insight is leveraging AI Agent architecture itself to compensate for the imprecision of natural language interfaces, thereby enabling better software planning and complexity estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to estimate the development effort and size for software systems with natural language interfaces by using an AI agent's planner to enumerate the required data sources, algorithms, and UI components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method to estimate the development effort and size of software systems that use large language models (LLMs) as intelligent interfaces. 

Specifically, the paper discusses the challenge of estimating effort when using LLMs to specify user stories and system requirements in natural language. Since LLMs introduce more ambiguity and flexibility compared to traditional structured requirements, it becomes difficult to quantify the scope and effort needed.

To address this, the paper proposes using the "planner" component of an AI agent to systematically enumerate the data sources, algorithms, and UI components needed to support various user queries and interactions. By generating a comprehensive list of sub-tasks, tools, and capabilities needed, the paper shows that it's possible to regain a similar level of precision in estimating scope and effort as with traditional user stories and use cases.

In essence, the key contribution is a method to decompose natural language system specifications into clearer technical requirements in order to support better effort estimation for systems using LLMs. This helps reconcile the flexibility of natural language interfaces with the need for quantification in software projects.

The paper discusses how the advancement of large language models like ChatGPT has led to their increased use in software design and development. However, estimating development effort and size for systems using natural language interfaces provided by LLMs can be challenging. The paper proposes leveraging the planner component of AI agents, along with careful prompt engineering, to generate lists of data sources, algorithms, and UI components needed. This helps regain the precision in effort estimation that traditional user stories provided. Key concepts like MVC architecture, tools, and the planner are highlighted as ways to break down tasks for estimation.

In summary, the core focus is on using AI agent architecture and capabilities to improve effort estimation for software projects relying on natural language interfaces and LLMs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
