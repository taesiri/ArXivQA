## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of automatically assessing physical rehabilitation exercises performed by patients without clinician supervision. The goal is to provide patients with a quality score to ensure they are doing the exercises correctly and getting desired rehabilitation results. Existing methods have limitations in providing detailed, visual feedback or continuous scoring. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new graph-based deep learning model called Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network with Transformer (D-STGCNT) for assessment of rehabilitation exercises using 3D skeleton joint data. The model combines a modified Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) with transformer architectures to efficiently handle spatiotemporal skeleton data.  

Key ideas:
- Represent skeleton joints as graph nodes and connections as edges to leverage topological structure 
- Use dense connections and gated recurrent units (GRU) to capture spatial-temporal dynamics
- Employ a transformer encoder block with attention mechanism to focus on relevant joints and sequences
- Provide visual feedback on joint significance to help patients improve

Main Contributions:
- A dense STGC-GRU model for end-to-end rehabilitation exercise assessment
- Introduction of computationally cheaper ConvGRU as alternative to ConvLSTM
- Leveraging transformers to overcome LSTM limitations in processing variable-length sequential data  
- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on two datasets - KIMORE and UI-PRMD
- Qualitative feedback on joint roles to assist patients in enhancing their exercises

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in accurate and efficient assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises using deep graph-based models and attention mechanisms. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative visuals showcase the effectiveness of the proposed D-STGCNT model.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A dense STGC-GRU model is proposed for end-to-end assessment of rehabilitation exercises.

2) A ConvGRU layer is employed as an alternative to ConvLSTM to lower computation during training and inference. 

3) A transformer encoder architecture is proposed to overcome basic LSTM limitations.

4) The proposed system offers clear guidance on which body parts or movements to focus on to enhance assessment quality, based on a self-attention mechanism.
