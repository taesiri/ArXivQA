# [The Machine Vision Iceberg Explained: Advancing Dynamic Testing by   Considering Holistic Environmental Circumstances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Testing machine vision (MV) for highly automated driving (HAD) systems is challenging due to the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world environments. 
- Current testing strategies have limitations:
  - Benchmarking functions on datasets averages accuracy in a way that masks specific causes of failures.
  - Anomaly detection is time-consuming and focuses on specific cases rather than overall robustness.
  - Scenario-based testing lacks nuanced consideration of environmental attributes and relationships.
- There is a need for a holistic testing approach that manages complexity and enables understanding of MV failures.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose systematically exploring multi-scale relationships between environmental circumstances and MV failures to understand deficiencies. 
- They introduce the "Granularity Grades" model with 7 levels to represent environmental information depth.
- An "Environmental Entity Relation Graph" is used to capture entities, grades, and MV performance. 
- This allows explicit deficits from a single cause and implicit deficits from patterns to be identified.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of challenges for MV testing using the Cynefin framework
- Drawing parallels between human vision deficits and MV to define common recognition deficits  
- Granularity Grades model to represent environmental information depth  
- Environmental Entity Relation Graph to link circumstances and MV performance
- Methodology demonstration identifying explicit and implicit MV deficits

In summary, the paper provides a systematic approach to explore environmental relationships across multiple scales to gain a more holistic understanding of machine vision failures for testing highly automated driving systems. The main concepts introduced are the Granularity Grades and Environmental Entity Relation Graph.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchical model called Granularity Grades to systematically explore the multi-scaled depths of understanding about the circumstances of environments that impact machine vision functions, in order to holistically identify root causes of failures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the hierarchical level model called "Granularity Grades". Specifically:

- The Granularity Grades model defines 7 informational depth levels for exploring and understanding the multi-scaled circumstances of environments that can impact machine vision functions. 

- It provides a structured way to assign machine vision outputs to root causes in the environment, using an entity-relationship graph. This allows identifying common machine vision deficits and deficiencies.

- The model and methodology aim to give developers and testers a more holistic overview of all the entities and relationships in a domain that can affect the performance of a machine vision system under test.

- By clustering patterns of relations and failures in the entity graph, the approach enables arguing general machine vision deficits related to the circumstances in high automated driving operating domains.

In summary, the Granularity Grades concept contributes a systematic exploration of environmental contexts, entities and their relationships in order to better identify limitations of machine vision systems in a more nuanced, structured way correlated to holistic domain circumstances. This can uncover problematic issues that may be overlooked by other testing approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Machine Vision (MV) 
- Highly Automated Driving (HAD) systems
- MV testing strategies (generalizing, deep-dive, overlooking)
- MV iceberg metaphor
- Cynefin framework (clear, complicated, complex, chaotic)
- Psychological vision deficits 
- MV deficits (incomplete domain knowledge, foreground-background differentiation, etc.)
- Granularity grades model  
- Environmental entity relation graph
- Explicit and implicit deficits
- Parallel categories diagram

The paper discusses testing strategies for machine vision in highly automated driving systems. It uses the metaphor of an "MV iceberg" to describe the challenges and proposes a model called "Granularity Grades" to explore the environmental circumstances that impact MV functions. The model allows creating an environmental entity relation graph to identify explicit and implicit deficits. The concepts aim to enable more holistic and nuanced testing of machine vision for automated driving.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the "Granularity Grades" model for exploring environmental circumstances that can impact machine vision performance. What are the key motivations and goals behind developing this model? How does it aim to address limitations in current testing approaches?

2. Explain the layers of the Granularity Grades model in detail. What type of environmental information does each layer aim to capture and why is this important? 

3. The paper defines two types of recognition deficits that can be identified using the Granularity Grades model - explicit and implicit deficits. Define these two types of deficits, explain how they manifest, and discuss how the model enables identifying them.  

4. The Environmental Entity Relation Graph is introduced as a way to visually represent and analyze relationships between environmental entities across granularity grades. Explain how this graph is constructed and what insights it aims to provide into machine vision performance.

5. Walk through the application of the Granularity Grades model on a specific machine vision system step-by-step, starting from raw sensor data. Discuss the key decisions and analysis involved at each layer of environmental granularity. 

6. The evaluation results reveal several issues with the machine vision systems analyzed, including phantom detections and foreground-background differentiation problems. Analyze these results in depth and discuss what deficits they indicate and why.

7. Discuss the strengths and limitations of using the Granularity Grades model for machine vision testing. What are some ways the approach could be expanded or improved in future work? 

8. Compare and contrast the Granularity Grades approach with other machine vision testing methods like benchmarking, anomaly detection, and scenario-based testing. What unique perspectives does it offer?

9. The paper highlights the importance of retrospection and past experiences in managing complexity and unexpected events in machine vision. Expand upon this concept - why is retrospection important and how can the Granularity Grades method enable it? 

10. The paper concludes by identifying two key challenges with applying the Granularity Grades model related to test data generation and measurement systems. Propose and discuss potential solutions or directions for addressing each of these challenges.
