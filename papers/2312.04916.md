# [EE-LLM: Large-Scale Training and Inference of Early-Exit Large Language   Models with 3D Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04916)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces EE-LLM, a system for scaling up training and inference of early-exit large language models (LLMs) using massive 3D parallelism. It allows adding flexible early-exit layers to Transformer models and training them at scale. The system implements a lightweight method to facilitate backpropagation of the aggregated early-exit losses through pipeline stages. It also leverages idle resources in the pipeline schedule to minimize training overhead of early exits. For inference, EE-LLM provides two approaches compatible with key-value caching: one based on caching recomputation, the other using a novel pipeline parallelism. Experiments show that EE-LLM achieves great training efficiency with negligible overhead. It also delivers outstanding inference speedup without compromising output quality or model capacity. The system aims to be a useful tool for further research and adoption of early-exit LLMs. Its source code is publicly available.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work on early-exit large language models (EE-LLMs) include:

- Early exiting - The core technique of allowing a neural network to exit early and make predictions without running through the full network. Enables adaptive computation and inference speedups.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Very large transformer-based models trained on massive amounts of text data. Early exiting is applied to LLMs in this work.

- 3D parallelism - Leveraging data, tensor/sequence, and pipeline parallelism across many GPUs/devices to scale up model sizes. A key challenge is supporting early exiting with pipeline parallelism.  

- Minimalistic early exits - Simple early exit layers with just an output embedding matrix and optional normalization. Help reduce overhead.

- Training efficiency - Optimizing training of early-exit LLMs to minimize overhead compared to standard LLMs, using techniques like deferred execution and load balancing.

- Autoregressive generation - Task of generating text token-by-token. Has conflict with early exiting and key-value caching.

- Key-value (KV) caching - Storing cached keys and values during text generation to reduce redundant computation.

- Pipeline inference - Novel pipeline parallelism approach for early-exit inference compatible with KV caching.

- Pipeline inference achieves better speedup than KV recomputation in experiments.
- Additional features like adaptive early-exit loss weighting, utilizing bubbles by partial forward/backward passes.

In summary, this paper proposes methods and system optimizations to enable scalable training and efficient inference for early-exit LLMs. The key innovation is making early-exit compatible with techniques like pipeline parallelism. Experiments verify good efficiency.
