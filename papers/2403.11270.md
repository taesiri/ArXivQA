# [Bilateral Propagation Network for Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Depth completion aims to produce a dense depth map from sparse depth measurements and a color image. It has applications like scene reconstruction and robot grasping.
- Current methods have issues directly convolving on sparse data and struggle to process irregular sampled sparse depth points. They also tend to oversmooth depth edges leading to loss of details.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Bilateral Propagation Network (BP-Net) which explicitly propagates depth in a preprocessing stage before convolving on sparse data.
- It parameterizes depth at a pixel as a weighted combination of nearby valid depth values. The weights depend on both radiometric difference (image content) and spatial distance through a learned multi-layer perceptron. This enables edge-preserving propagation.
- The propagation is arranged in a multi-scale architecture to deal with holes without nearby depth. The initial low-resolution prediction guides high-resolution estimation.
- After propagation, a U-Net fuses image features and propagated depth. Then a refinement network updates depth iteratively using convolutional spatial propagation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces bilateral propagation to avoid directly convolving on sparse depth and ambiguity issues in prior works. The content and spatial distance aware weights enable edge-preserving propagation.
- Propagates depth at the earliest stage in contrast to recent methods that refine depth at later stages. Shows the significance of early propagation through experiments.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on NYUv2 and KITTI datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy of different components.
