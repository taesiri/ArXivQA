# [Cone Ranking for Multi-Criteria Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of ranking alternatives in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) when the weights for the different criteria are unknown or there are non-comparable alternative pairs. The common weighted sum method requires fixing weights in advance, which is subjective. The paper proposes a new ranking method based on cone distribution functions from statistics that takes into account a collection of weighted sum scalarizations at once.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces cone ranking functions, based on empirical lower cone distribution functions, that rank alternatives relative to each other by counting the minimal number of other alternatives they dominate over all feasible weight distributions. This avoids having to fix one particular weight vector a priori. The ranking functions enjoy properties like strictness, affine equivariance, and detect certain Pareto optimal points.

The paper characterizes situations when different types of rank reversal occur with the new method, and explains why this can actually be useful to analyze the ranking procedure itself. The shape of the "cones" generating the ranking can also be adjusted to allow for more compensation across criteria.

Main Contributions:
- A new ranking method for MCDM based on multivariate statistics cone distribution functions
- Method takes into account a collection of weighted sum scalarizations at once 
- Useful rank reversal characterization and interpretation
- Detects certain Pareto optimal alternatives
- Flexibility in choice of cones allowing compensation across criteria
- Potential use as supervised classification model in machine learning

Overall, the paper introduces a novel perspective for ranking alternatives in MCDM using ideas from statistics, with useful features like rank reversal detection and flexibility.
