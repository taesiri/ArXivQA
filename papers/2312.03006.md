# [Cone Ranking for Multi-Criteria Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of ranking alternatives in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) when the weights for the different criteria are unknown or there are non-comparable alternative pairs. The common weighted sum method requires fixing weights in advance, which is subjective. The paper proposes a new ranking method based on cone distribution functions from statistics that takes into account a collection of weighted sum scalarizations at once.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces cone ranking functions, based on empirical lower cone distribution functions, that rank alternatives relative to each other by counting the minimal number of other alternatives they dominate over all feasible weight distributions. This avoids having to fix one particular weight vector a priori. The ranking functions enjoy properties like strictness, affine equivariance, and detect certain Pareto optimal points.

The paper characterizes situations when different types of rank reversal occur with the new method, and explains why this can actually be useful to analyze the ranking procedure itself. The shape of the "cones" generating the ranking can also be adjusted to allow for more compensation across criteria.

Main Contributions:
- A new ranking method for MCDM based on multivariate statistics cone distribution functions
- Method takes into account a collection of weighted sum scalarizations at once 
- Useful rank reversal characterization and interpretation
- Detects certain Pareto optimal alternatives
- Flexibility in choice of cones allowing compensation across criteria
- Potential use as supervised classification model in machine learning

Overall, the paper introduces a novel perspective for ranking alternatives in MCDM using ideas from statistics, with useful features like rank reversal detection and flexibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Recently introduced multivariate statistical functions are adapted to define a new multi-criteria decision making ranking method that considers multiple weight distributions simultaneously and has useful rank reversal properties for analyzing the ranking procedure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new ranking function for multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based on cone distribution functions from statistics. Specifically:

- The paper defines a new cone ranking function that takes into account a whole set of predefined linear scalarizations at once, rather than fixing a particular scalarization in advance. This absorbs a collection of weighted sum scalarizations and is more flexible.

- The ranking function enjoys certain rank reversal features that are characterized in the paper. These features are shown to be potentially useful for analyzing the ranking procedure itself, rather than just being a nuisance. 

- The ranking function is able to detect certain non-convex Pareto optimal alternatives that do not lie on the boundary of the convex hull. This is a useful property.

- The choice of the cone allows flexibility for the decision maker to specify lower and upper bounds on criteria weights. This creates compensation opportunities between criteria.

- Potential applications in supervised machine learning are outlined, using the ranking function's level sets for classification.

In summary, the main contribution is a new MCDM ranking method with several useful properties, based on adapting statistical cone distribution functions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the cone ranking method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that the cone ranking function can be seen as an upgrade of the weighted sum scalarization method. In what ways does the cone ranking function improve upon the limitations of the weighted sum method? What specific issues does it address?

2. Theorem 1 provides a sufficient condition for an alternative to be Pareto maximal based on its cone ranking score. Explain the logic behind this result and why the converse is not necessarily true. Provide an example illustrating this.  

3. The paper argues that rank reversal is a useful feature for the proposed method rather than a drawback. Explain the types of insights that can be gained from analyzing when and why rank reversals occur according to this method. Provide some examples.

4. How does the choice of the "MCDM cone" C impact the resulting rankings produced by the cone ranking method? Explain the considerations involved in selecting an appropriate cone C for a given multi-criteria decision problem.  

5. The interpretation section mentions the concept of "common" and "rare" alternatives. Define precisely what is meant by these terms in the context of this ranking approach and discuss how they could be identified.

6. Explain the connections drawn in the paper between the proposed ranking method and set-valued quantiles. How can these connections be leveraged for purposes like supervised classification models?

7. What are some ways the ideas from this method could be extended, such as using different types of statistical depth functions? Elaborate on some possibilities.  

8. Analyze the computational complexity of determining the cone ranking score. What factors drive the complexity and what types of algorithms and techniques could be used?

9. Discuss some of the key differences you would expect between rankings produced by this method versus common approaches like TOPSIS. Provide examples to illustrate.

10. How well do you think the cone ranking approach addresses limitations of other MCDM methods? What do you see as its main advantages and disadvantages?
