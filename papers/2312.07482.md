# [Classification of retail products: From probabilistic ranking to neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grocery industry is undergoing digital transformation, requiring high-quality product data to enable processes like customization, promotions, etc. 
- Spanish company Midiadia works on converting retailer product data into useful insights. They currently manually categorize products into a predefined 3-level food taxonomy.
- Manual classification is inefficient and error-prone given the volume and constant change of products. Automating this is challenging due to variety of products/suppliers.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide an automatic multi-label classification methodology to map new grocery products to up to 3 category labels from 159 possible varieties.

- Use product name, legal name, ingredients as input features. Compare 3 classifier approaches:
   1) Score-based model using adapted BM25 ranking 
   2) Machine learning with KNN, Fuzzy KNN (FKNN), XGBoost after PCA dimensionality reduction
   3) Deep neural network with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) after PCA

- Evaluate on real-world groceries dataset of 20,888 products. Tuned algorithms for optimal parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Solution to automatically categorize constantly changing grocery catalogue into predefined taxonomy, supporting more efficient catalog maintenance. 

- Provides retailers with 4 different classifiers - score-based, ML, and DNN to choose from based on performance comparison.

- Score-based and FKNN give best accuracy for Top 2 and Top 3 recommended categories. Score-based works well but is closely followed by FKNN.

- For single Top 1 category, FKNN performs best, closely followed by KNN.

In summary, the paper tackles an important real-world industry problem of automated grocery classification, offers a comparison of different ML/DNN approaches, and provides insights to help adopt the best-suited solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and compares several machine learning approaches, including a score-based model, nearest-neighbor models, XGBoost, and neural networks, for automatically classifying grocery products into a predefined taxonomy to assist a company in maintaining product data quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is providing retail companies with an automatic categorization solution for new products. Specifically, the paper introduces a multi-label classification methodology to map new product inputs (name, ingredients, etc.) to up to 3 predicted category labels from a predefined taxonomy. This automates the previously manual process of deciding which variety (category) a new grocery product belongs to. The methodology is designed to be horizontally applicable to other retail domains beyond groceries as well. The paper compares several classification approaches, including a score-based ranking method, traditional machine learning algorithms like KNN and XGBoost, and deep neural networks.

The paper introduces a solution to automatically categorize grocery products into a predefined food taxonomy with 3 levels. It compares different classification approaches like score-based methods, machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. The key goal is to assign the correct "Variety" category to new unseen grocery products based on their name, ingredients etc. It uses real dataset from a Spanish company Midiadia that works with retailers. Overall the key focus is on automating the categorization of highly dynamic grocery catalogs using variety prediction models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper applies several data preprocessing steps like removing parentheses, numbers, stopwords etc. What is the rationale behind each of these steps? How do they help in improving the performance of the downstream classifiers?

2. The paper creates a variety matrix in addition to the product matrix for the score-based BM25 model. Explain the intuition and formulation behind creating this additional variety matrix. How does it capture uniqueness of varieties?

3. Explain the modifications done to the standard BM25 equation for adapting it to the grocery product classification task. What practical benefits do additions of 1 in numerator and denominator provide? 

4. The paper applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction before applying KNN and other ML models. Explain how PCA helps in improving computational and statistical performance here.

5. The choice of distance metric significantly impacts KNN model performance. Discuss the comparative analysis done across different metrics like Euclidean, Cosine etc. and provide reasons behind Spearman distance giving the best performance.  

6. Explain the key differences between the KNN and Fuzzy KNN model formulations. How does introduction of fuzzy memberships help in improving predictive performance?

7. What are the core components and training process of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model? How does it optimize both loss and complexity for preventing overfitting?

8. Discuss the architecture, training and inference process for the Multi-Layer Perceptron model. How were optimal hyperparameters like number of nodes, layers etc. selected? 

9. Compare and contrast the score-based, ML and DNN models on metrics like accuracy, computation time, interpretability etc. Which model gives the best performance for Top 1, 2 and 3 variety prediction?

10. The current analysis is done on a static grocery product dataset. What modifications would be needed to adapt the models for real-time classification of newly incoming products?
