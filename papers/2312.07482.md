# [Classification of retail products: From probabilistic ranking to neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grocery industry is undergoing digital transformation, requiring high-quality product data to enable processes like customization, promotions, etc. 
- Spanish company Midiadia works on converting retailer product data into useful insights. They currently manually categorize products into a predefined 3-level food taxonomy.
- Manual classification is inefficient and error-prone given the volume and constant change of products. Automating this is challenging due to variety of products/suppliers.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide an automatic multi-label classification methodology to map new grocery products to up to 3 category labels from 159 possible varieties.

- Use product name, legal name, ingredients as input features. Compare 3 classifier approaches:
   1) Score-based model using adapted BM25 ranking 
   2) Machine learning with KNN, Fuzzy KNN (FKNN), XGBoost after PCA dimensionality reduction
   3) Deep neural network with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) after PCA

- Evaluate on real-world groceries dataset of 20,888 products. Tuned algorithms for optimal parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Solution to automatically categorize constantly changing grocery catalogue into predefined taxonomy, supporting more efficient catalog maintenance. 

- Provides retailers with 4 different classifiers - score-based, ML, and DNN to choose from based on performance comparison.

- Score-based and FKNN give best accuracy for Top 2 and Top 3 recommended categories. Score-based works well but is closely followed by FKNN.

- For single Top 1 category, FKNN performs best, closely followed by KNN.

In summary, the paper tackles an important real-world industry problem of automated grocery classification, offers a comparison of different ML/DNN approaches, and provides insights to help adopt the best-suited solution.
