# Event Transition Planning for Open-ended Text Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can explicit modeling of event transitions improve the coherence and diversity of open-ended text generation?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Explicitly modeling event transitions with a generative event transition planner can help arrange causality and logical flow in open-ended text generation tasks like dialogue and story completion. 2) Incorporating the generated event transition paths into the text generation process via an event query layer can guide the model to produce more coherent and diverse continuations.3) The proposed two-stage coarse-to-fine approach of first generating event transitions and then generating text conditioned on those transitions can outperform standard fine-tuning of pretrained language models that do not explicitly model event transitions.The experiments seem designed to validate these hypotheses by comparing the proposed two-stage model against strong autoregressive baselines on dialogue and story completion tasks using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The overall goal is to show that explicitly modeling event transitions in this way improves open-ended text generation quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage method for improving coherence and diversity in open-ended text generation tasks like story completion and dialogue generation. The key ideas are:1. Using an event transition planner in the first stage to explicitly model the arrangement of ensuing events given limited context. This planner is trained on event transition sequences from commonsense knowledge graphs as well as task training data.2. Integrating the planned event transition path into the text generation model via a specialized event query layer. This allows the generator to attend to the planned path when producing the output text. 3. Evaluating the approach on story completion using ROCStories and dialogue generation using EmpatheticDialogues. Results show improvements over strong baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, especially for long and difficult generation cases.In summary, the main contribution is a planning-based coarse-to-fine approach to improve high-level coherence and diversity in open-ended text generation. The key innovation is the integration of an inductive bias towards organizing event transitions through specialized training and architecture design.
