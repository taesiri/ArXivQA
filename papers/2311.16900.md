# [Lane-Keeping Control of Autonomous Vehicles Through a Soft-Constrained   Iterative LQR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16900)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a soft-constrained iterative linear-quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm for smooth lane-keeping control of autonomous vehicles. The method integrates constrained iterative LQR (CILQR) with a model predictive control technique involving relaxed constraints using slack variables. This allows the optimizer to compute stabilizing control actions even with disturbances, without needing additional smoothing. The algorithm is tested on a vehicle path-tracking model in numerical simulations and vision-based experiments on TORCS. Results show the soft-CILQR controller enables smoother steering control and lower tracking errors compared to the CILQR controller, especially in noisy conditions. The soft constraints facilitate less conservative state trajectories while retaining computational efficiency. Overall, the proposed soft-CILQR algorithm is able to maintain stability and tracking accuracy for autonomous vehicle lane-keeping under disturbances, without requiring extra post-processing of the controls.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a soft-constrained iterative linear-quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm for the lane-keeping control of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, the authors:

1) Integrate a constraint softening method and the constrained iterative LQR (CILQR) algorithm to create the soft-CILQR algorithm. This allows slack variables to be incorporated into the barrier functions for steering angle and lateral offset constraints.

2) Analyze the behavior of the soft-CILQR algorithm under additive disturbances through numerical simulations using a linear path-tracking model. Compare its performance to the standard CILQR algorithm.

3) Validate the performance of soft-CILQR for self-driving vehicle control through vision-based lane-keeping experiments in TORCS. Show that it outperforms CILQR in terms of tracking accuracy and steering smoothness.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and experimental validation of the soft-CILQR algorithm for smooth and stable lane-keeping control of autonomous vehicles under disturbances and uncertainties. The algorithm integrates constraint relaxation and CILQR to efficiently generate stabilizing control actions.
