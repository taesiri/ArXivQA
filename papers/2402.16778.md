# [On the Growth of Mistakes in Differentially Private Online Learning: A   Lower Bound Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies differential privacy (DP) in the online learning setting, where an algorithm makes predictions sequentially while seeing only one data point at a time. 
- Prior work has shown that DP online learning algorithms inevitability incur a growing number of mistakes that scales as O(log T) with the number of rounds T. This is in contrast to non-private online learning where the mistakes remain constant.
- An open question has been whether this logarithmic growth rate is fundamental to DP online learning or if better algorithms exist.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a lower bound that matches the known upper bounds up to log factors, showing that the logarithmic growth rate is necessary.
- They make an assumption on the learning algorithm called "concentration". Intuitively, this means that for a certain distinguishing input, the algorithm's outputs are highly concentrated (i.e. very likely to output the same hypothesis).
- Under the concentration assumption, they construct an input sequence adaptively where the algorithm is likely to make a mistake on each inserted point, leading to Omega(log T) total mistakes for T rounds.

Main Contributions:  
- First lower bound on the mistakes for approximate DP online learning.
- The lower bound matches existing upper bounds, showing they are tight up to log factors.
- Their concentration assumption holds for existing DP online learning algorithms like the DP-SOA algorithm.
- Shows that the logarithmic growth of mistakes with T is an inherent limitation for DP online learning over long horizons.

In summary, the paper makes significant progress on understanding the fundamental limitations of differentially private online learning algorithms by providing tight lower bounds on the number of mistakes.
