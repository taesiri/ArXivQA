# [ActiveClean: Generating Line-Level Vulnerability Data via Active   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01588)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents ActiveClean, a scalable tool that leverages active machine learning to automatically generate line-level vulnerability data from commits. The key idea is to train models to distinguish vulnerability-relevant lines from irrelevant ones like refactoring based on designed syntactic and semantic features. Through an active learning approach, ActiveClean reaches 70% F1 score using just 400 manually labeled data. When applied to clean the FFmpeg dataset, it reduced 50% of the lines as irrelevant and enabled the state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detector LineVul to identify 18 more functions and 70 more lines as vulnerable, improving its Top 10 accuracy from 66% to 73%. The cleaned dataset also helped detect 29 incorrect vulnerability labels. Overall, ActiveClean demonstrates an effective way to automatically produce cleaner line-level vulnerability data to facilitate building better vulnerability detectors.
