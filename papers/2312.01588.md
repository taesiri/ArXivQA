# [ActiveClean: Generating Line-Level Vulnerability Data via Active   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01588)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents ActiveClean, a scalable tool that leverages active machine learning to automatically generate line-level vulnerability data from commits. The key idea is to train models to distinguish vulnerability-relevant lines from irrelevant ones like refactoring based on designed syntactic and semantic features. Through an active learning approach, ActiveClean reaches 70% F1 score using just 400 manually labeled data. When applied to clean the FFmpeg dataset, it reduced 50% of the lines as irrelevant and enabled the state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detector LineVul to identify 18 more functions and 70 more lines as vulnerable, improving its Top 10 accuracy from 66% to 73%. The cleaned dataset also helped detect 29 incorrect vulnerability labels. Overall, ActiveClean demonstrates an effective way to automatically produce cleaner line-level vulnerability data to facilitate building better vulnerability detectors.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ActiveClean: Generating Line-Level Vulnerability Data via Active Learning":

Problem:
- Deep learning based vulnerability detection tools rely on large volumes of high-quality training data. 
- Most existing datasets only provide function-level labels indicating if a function is vulnerable. 
- For vulnerability detection to be useful, we need line-level data indicating the specific lines responsible for the vulnerability. 
- Manually cleaning commits to generate line-level data is expensive and not scalable.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ActiveClean, a tool to automatically generate line-level vulnerability data from commits using active learning. 
- It extracts syntactic and semantic features from commit lines to train a model to classify each line as vulnerability-relevant or irrelevant.
- An active learning framework with a "query by committee" approach is used to efficiently train the model with minimal labeled data.

Main Contributions:
- An automatic technique and scalable tool (ActiveClean) to clean patches and generate line-level vulnerability data.
- New feature engineering and application of active learning for this problem.  
- Evaluation on Java and C datasets with over 4.3K commits and 119K lines showing 70-74% F1 score.
- Line-level vulnerability dataset with labels for 5K functions in FFmpeg. 
- Demonstration that vulnerability detection model (LineVul) improves from 66% to 73% top 10 accuracy when trained on ActiveClean dataset compared to original dataset.

The key idea is to use active learning to train a model to distinguish vulnerability-relevant vs irrelevant lines in commits based on code features. This helps automatically clean commits to generate useful line-level vulnerability data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.
