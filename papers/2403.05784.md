# [Kiri-Spoon: A Soft Shape-Changing Utensil for Robot-Assisted Feeding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Assistive robots have potential to help people with disabilities eat meals independently. However, it is challenging for robots to manipulate traditional utensils (forks, spoons) to pick up food without dropping or spilling it. 
- Existing soft grippers are very effective at grasping food securely, but are not convenient for humans to take bites from.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "Kiri-Spoon", a novel utensil for robot-assisted feeding that combines properties of traditional spoons and soft grippers. 
- Kiri-Spoon uses a kirigami structure made of safe, flexible material that the robot can actively deform to adjust the curvature and wrap around food similar to a soft gripper. 
- At low curvature, Kiri-Spoon has a familiar spoon shape for conveniently scooping and feeding. At high curvature, it firmly grasps food to prevent spills during transfer.

Main Contributions:
- Design of Kiri-Spoon and its soft kirigami gripping mechanism.
- Modeling the mechanics and geometry of Kiri-Spoon's adjustable curvature as a spring-loaded linkage. Experiments validate model accuracy.  
- User study comparing Kiri-Spoon to conventional spoon & fork in controlling robot to pick up foods. Kiri-Spoon reduced spills and was preferred by most users.
- Demonstrating new "human-robot" utensil balancing shape/use convenience for human and robust food grasping capability for robot.

In summary, this paper presents the design and characterization of Kiri-Spoon, a novel robot feeding utensil using soft kirigami gripping to securely hold food. Experiments and user studies demonstrate Kiri-Spoon reduces spills compared to traditional utensils.
