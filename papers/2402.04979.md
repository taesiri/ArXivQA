# [Detection and Pose Estimation of flat, Texture-less Industry Objects on   HoloLens using synthetic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation methods are too computationally intensive to run on edge devices like Microsoft HoloLens or Apple iPad. However, the quality of augmented reality applications relies on accurate 6D pose estimation. 
- Training pose estimators on not-yet-manufactured objects is difficult since no real images exist. 
- Existing solutions do not provide an easy-to-use augmented reality assistance application for industrial use cases like object sorting.

Proposed Solution:
- A client-server architecture that runs computationally heavy 6D pose estimation on a server and streams back results to be visualized on edge devices. This enables deploying complex pose estimators on low-power devices.
- A pipeline to automatically generate 3D models and synthetic training data from vector graphics of objects from manufacturing documents. This allows training pose estimators without real images.
- An augmented reality application with a graphical user interface to assist users in sorting industrial objects based on color-coded overlays using the estimated 6D poses. Tested on Microsoft HoloLens 2.

Key Contributions:
- Qualitative and quantitative demonstration of state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on texture-less industrial objects using only synthetic training data.
- Implementation of an augmented reality assisted object sorting application using client-server architecture, showing the applicability of the trained models on real-world industry use cases.  
- Detailed analysis to highlight suitablity on metallic objects based on tests on synthetic test images and real test images from HoloLens 2 camera.
- Modular pipeline allowing easy swapping of components like object detector or pose estimator networks based on requirements.

The key novelty is enabling complex 6D pose augmented reality applications on edge devices for not-yet-manufactured objects without needing real training images. This is achieved via synthetic data and client-server architecture. The applicability for real-world industry scenarios is demonstrated through an assisted object sorting use case.
