# [MM-SAP: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Self-Awareness of   Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive abilities in visual perception and understanding. However, evaluating their capabilities comprehensively remains a challenge. 
- Existing benchmarks focus on assessing perception, cognition and reasoning, while neglecting MLLMs' self-awareness - their ability to recognize their own capability boundaries. This can lead to inconsistencies and hallucinations.
- Knowledge quadrants used for language models are not directly applicable to MLLMs due to the multimodal inputs. This poses challenges in defining and analyzing MLLMs' self-awareness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper incorporates visual perception into the knowledge quadrants framework to develop a modified quadrant tailored for MLLMs. 
- It categorizes information into basic visual, knowledge-based visual, and beyond the image. The first two are defined as "knowns" and the last as "unknowns" to the MLLM.
- Based on this, the concepts of "known knowns" and "known unknowns" are introduced to categorize MLLMs' self-awareness capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Development of a "Knowledge Quadrant" framework tailored specifically for MLLMs to define and advance their self-aware capacities.
- Proposal of MM-SAP, the first benchmark with 3 datasets systematically evaluating MLLMs' self-awareness from known knowns and known unknowns perspectives.
- Extensive experiments evaluating self-awareness of 8 well-known MLLMs. This provides insights into current MLLMs' limitations in recognizing unknowns, guiding future developments.

In summary, the paper offers an innovative evaluation perspective for more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of MLLMs through its novel knowledge quadrant framework and purpose-built benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MM-SAP, a novel benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models' self-awareness of their capabilities and limitations in visual perception.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Incorporating visual perception, the authors develop and introduce the "Knowledge Quadrant" framework specifically for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This provides a way to define and assess the self-aware capabilities of MLLMs.

2. Based on the proposed knowledge quadrant for MLLMs, the authors propose a new dataset called MM-SAP, which is the first benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' self-awareness in terms of both their knowledge of what they can perceive from an image (known knowns) and their awareness of what they cannot perceive (known unknowns). 

3. The authors evaluate the self-awareness capabilities of a wide range of MLLMs using MM-SAP. The results show most existing MLLMs only have good performance in knowing knowns but fail to recognize what they do not know. These experimental results provide insights into future directions for developing MLLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a novel benchmark (MM-SAP) and knowledge quadrant framework to assess the self-awareness of MLLMs, along with an analysis of various MLLMs using this methodology.

The paper introduces the concept of a knowledge quadrant for MLLMs to assess their self-awareness capabilities in perception. It proposes a new benchmark called MM-SAP with three sub-datasets (BasicVisQA, KnowVisQA, BeyondVisQA) to evaluate MLLMs on their awareness of what they can and cannot perceive from images. Key capabilities examined include processing of basic visual information, knowledge-based visual recognition, and identifying information beyond images. The terms and keywords reflect this focus on evaluating self-awareness in perception for multimodal large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel knowledge quadrant framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). How does this framework expand on the existing knowledge quadrant for language models to account for multimodal inputs? What new categories of knowledge does it define?

2. The paper proposes the MM-SAP benchmark to evaluate self-awareness in perception for MLLMs. What are the key differences in the design of MM-SAP compared to previous MLLM benchmarks in terms of the capabilities assessed? 

3. The MM-SAP benchmark contains three distinct sub-datasets - BasicVisQA, KnowVisQA, and BeyondVisQA. Explain the key objectives and focus areas of each sub-dataset. What specific aspects of self-awareness do they aim to evaluate?

4. The paper evaluates eight well-known MLLMs using the proposed MM-SAP benchmark. Analyze and compare the performance of these models across the three sub-datasets. What insights do the results provide into their self-aware capabilities?

5. The paper introduces additional metrics beyond overall self-aware scores on MM-SAP, including known-knowns, known-unknowns, answer rate and answer accuracy. Discuss how analyzing these metrics provides further insights into model performance. How do they help attribute gaps in self-aware scores?

6. The results demonstrate a clear gap between GPT-4V and other MLLMs on the BeyondVisQA sub-dataset. Hypothesize potential reasons behind GPT-4V's superior performance in assessing knowledge beyond visual information provided.

7. While GPT-4V achieves higher self-aware scores, the results also show lower answer rates for basic visual questions. Analyze this trade-off between accuracy in known-unknowns versus detriments to known-knowns performance.

8. The paper focuses evaluation on image perception tasks. Discuss how the proposed knowledge quadrant and MM-SAP benchmark can be expanded to assess self-awareness for other modalities. What additional considerations may be required?

9. The paper identifies model self-awareness as key to mitigating issues such as hallucination in MLLMs. In light of the evaluation results, what improvements can be made to enhance self-aware capabilities? 

10. The benchmark metrics calculate scores based on model selection frequency of aware options and refusal options. Propose other potential metrics that could capture nuanced differences in model confidence on knowns versus unknowns.
