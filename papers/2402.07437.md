# [Learning Optimal Tax Design in Nonatomic Congestion Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies how to learn the optimal tax design to maximize efficiency in nonatomic congestion games. Congestion games model situations where selfish agents share resources like roads or communication networks. Self-interested behavior can lead to inefficient outcomes like traffic jams. An common approach is to impose taxes on the use of resources to provide incentives for efficiency. However, designing the optimal taxes requires knowing the underlying congestion game model which is often unknown. Thus, the paper studies how to learn the optimal taxes when only equilibrium feedback is available, i.e. only observing the equilibrium state caused by imposing a tax.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an efficient algorithm to learn an ε-optimal tax using piecewise linear functions to approximate the unknown optimal marginal cost taxes. The algorithm addresses several key challenges:

1) The exponentially large search space of possible tax functions. This is handled by using a grid-based piecewise linear parameterization.

2) The lack of gradient information and non-convexity of the social welfare objective. The algorithm adds an extra strongly convex term to the taxes to guarantee a unique Lipschitz equilibrium. It also uses an efficient subroutine to find ``boundary'' taxes that reveal information. 

3) The need for strategic exploration when only equilibrium feedback is available. The exploratory taxes designed make the equilibrium ``on the boundary'' so that an additional perturbation will provably change the equilibrium.

The algorithm achieves an O(F^2β/ε) sample complexity without assumptions on the cost functions. For network congestion games, an efficient implementation is provided with time complexity polynomial in the network size.

Main Contributions:

1) First algorithm for learning optimal taxes in congestion games with equilibrium feedback and practical sample complexity.

2) Novel techniques like piecewise approximation, adding strong convexity, and exploratory taxes tailored for congestion game structure.

3) Efficient implementation for network congestion games avoiding exponential dependence on action space.

4) Provide insights and techniques for learning in games and optimization with equilibrium constraints.

In summary, the paper provides an efficient and practical algorithm for the open problem of learning to optimize the behavior of self-interested agents with tax mechanisms. The approach is tailored to leverage domain structure and addresses challenges like lack of direct feedback. The results can have implications for designing taxes in real network congestion applications.
