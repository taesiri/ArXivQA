# [On the Learnability of Watermarks for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04469)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates whether watermarks for detecting model-generated text can be learned by language models, as opposed to relying on specialized decoding algorithms during text generation. The authors propose two methods - logits-based and sampling-based watermark distillation - for training student models to mimic teacher models with existing decoding-based watermarks. Experiments across three decoding-based watermarking strategies show that higher-distortion watermarks are more easily learned, while lower-distortion watermarks require more data and compute to learn. However, all tested watermarks exhibit some degree of learnability. The learned weight-based watermarks are robust to changes in decoding methods. Potential applications in developing watermarking for open models and investigating watermark spoofing attacks are discussed. While promising first steps, challenges remain in improving robustness to further fine-tuning and using watermarks to definitively assign blame. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations around the learnability of text watermarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is investigating the learnability of watermarks for language models. Specifically, the authors:

1) Propose two methods called "logits-based watermark distillation" and "sampling-based watermark distillation" for training a student model to learn weights-based watermarking from a teacher model with decoding-based watermarking.

2) Experiment with three different decoding-based watermarking strategies (KGW, Aar, KTH) and various hyperparameter settings. They find that higher-distortion watermarks are more easily learned, while lower-distortion watermarks are harder but still learnable given sufficient data and compute. 

3) Demonstrate applications towards developing watermarking for open models and studying the possibility of watermark spoofing attacks. They show weights-based watermarking is robust to decoding changes, useful for open models, but also raises the risk of spoofing attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and systematically studying the problem of learning to generate watermarked text using only the weights of a language model, motivated by enabling watermarking for open models and studying potential spoofing attacks. The paper proposes methods for this weights-based watermarking and investigates the efficacy and limitations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed watermark distillation approach compare to other knowledge distillation techniques for transferring capabilities between neural networks? What are the key similarities and differences?

2. The paper studies both logits-based and sampling-based distillation for learning watermarks. What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches in terms of sample efficiency, computational efficiency, required access to the teacher model, etc.?

3. How does the degree of distortion induced by the different watermarking schemes relate to their learnability? Why might higher distortion watermarks be easier to learn via distillation?

4. What are the key remaining challenges towards developing watermarking strategies that are robust to further fine-tuning, as discussed in the application to open models? How might these challenges be addressed? 

5. In the context of potential spoofing attacks, what defenses could a model provider employ to prevent an adversary from learning to generate watermarked text? How would using multiple watermark keys impact detectability?

6. How do the watermarks compare in terms of robustness to text edits? Why is the KTH watermark significantly more robust than KGW and Aar? How is the edit robustness achieved?

7. What implications does the possibility of spoofing attacks have on using watermarks for provenance attribution? How does it impact responsible deployment of watermarking?

8. How efficient and sample complex is it to learn the different watermarking schemes? How does sample complexity relate to distortion level and complexity of watermarking algorithm?

9. Why is learning lower distortion watermarks more challenging? Is there a theoretical justification for why they require more samples to learn equally well?

10. Could the proposed distillation framework be extended to more complex watermarking schemes like semantic or public-key based watermarks? What challenges might arise?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Existing watermarking methods for language models rely on modifying the decoding process to embed watermarks. This makes them unsuitable for open models where users have access to model weights and can change decoding algorithms. It also makes them potentially vulnerable to spoofing attacks.  

- The authors investigate whether language models can directly learn to generate watermarked text using just their weights, without relying on a special decoding algorithm. This is referred to as "weights-based watermarking".

Proposed Solution
- The authors propose two methods for a student model to learn weights-based watermarking from a teacher model with decoding-based watermarking:
  1) Logits-based distillation: Train the student to match the teacher's next token distributions 
  2) Sampling-based distillation: Generate watermarked text using the teacher, then finetune the student on it

- The authors experiment with 3 decoding-based watermarking methods from recent papers and vary their hyperparameters.

Key Results
- Both distillation methods successfully learn higher distortion watermarks, achieving high detectability. Lower distortion watermarks are harder but still learnable.

- Weights-based watermarking is robust to changes in decoding algorithms. However, the learned watermarking capabilities disappear after further finetuning on normal text.

- Sampling-based distillation enables simulating spoofing attacks. The authors demonstrate an attack on an instruction-following chat model to generate harmful watermarked text.

Main Contributions
- First investigation into the learnability of watermarks for language models
- Proposal of two distillation methods to learn weights-based watermarking 
- Analysis of learnability under different watermarking strategies and hyperparameters
- Demonstrations of applications to open models and spoofing attacks
