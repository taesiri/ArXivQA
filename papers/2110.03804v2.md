# [FOCUS: Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03804v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How well do popular deep learning image classifiers generalize to classifying images containing familiar objects in uncommon or atypical settings/contexts?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Standard image datasets used to train deep learning models today are biased towards containing more images of objects in their common or typical contexts (e.g. planes in sky, cars on roads). This causes models trained on them to rely too heavily on contextual cues and fail to generalize to atypical contexts.

2) Explicitly collecting and evaluating on a dataset containing images of familiar objects in both common and uncommon contexts will reveal poor generalization of current models. 

3) Fine-tuning models on a dataset with uncommon contexts will improve their ability to classify familiar objects in uncommon settings.

4) The proposed FOCUS dataset can be used to add richer contextual attribute annotations to existing datasets like ImageNet to facilitate future work on improving generalization.

In summary, the main research question is assessing how well current deep learning image classifiers, trained on biased datasets, generalize to uncommon contexts. The key hypotheses are that generalization will be poor initially but can be improved via datasets like FOCUS.
