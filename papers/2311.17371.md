# [Are we going MAD? Benchmarking Multi-Agent Debate between Language   Models for Medical Q&amp;A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17371)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive benchmark of multi-agent debate (MAD) strategies for answering medical exam questions using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and PaLM. It explores several MAD techniques like Society of Minds, Multi-Persona, ChatEval, Self-Consistency, and Ensemble Refinement. Experiments are conducted on medical QA datasets MedQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU to analyze accuracy, cost, time and other metrics. The results show MAD can improve accuracy but with higher cost. An analysis of debate metrics like consensus reveals insights - high accuracy runs often have agents that change answers and reach consensus. The paper introduces a new agreement modulation strategy that prompts agents to agree more, giving a 15% boost on a MedQA subset. Overall, this rigorous study demonstrates the utility of MAD for medical QA while highlighting research gaps around selecting debate strategies. The open-sourced benchmark suite enables standardized comparisons and measurements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper benchmarks multi-agent debate strategies for improving the performance of language models on medical question answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Providing a comprehensive benchmark of multi-agent debate (MAD) strategies for medical question answering, analyzing the impact on accuracy, time, and cost.

2) Developing an open-source suite of MAD implementations with a unified API to make it easy for the research community to build upon and experiment with. 

3) Demonstrating that modulating the agreement level between agents during a debate via prompts can improve performance. Specifically, they introduce a novel debate prompting strategy based on agreement intensity that achieves new state-of-the-art results on a medical Q&A dataset.

In summary, the paper advances the understanding and effective utilization of MAD strategies, providing insights into the trade-offs and performance improvements possible, as well as introducing a new high-performing debate prompting technique. The open-source release aims to spur further research and applications of MAD methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new debate-prompting strategy that modulates the level of agreement between agents during a debate. How exactly does this strategy work? What specific prompts are used to modulate the agreement level? 

2. The paper found that increasing the agreement intensity in prompts led to substantial performance gains for Multi-Persona and smaller gains for Society of Minds. Why do you think agreement intensity had a bigger impact on Multi-Persona? What are the key differences between these strategies?

3. The paper benchmarked performance of MAD strategies on medical QA datasets like MedQA, PubMedQA and MMLU. Do you think the relative performance of different MAD strategies would change significantly if tested on non-medical datasets? Why or why not?

4. The paper experimented with various debate configurations like number of agents, debate rounds etc. Is there an optimal configuration that works best across different MAD strategies and datasets? If not, what factors determine the ideal configuration?

5. The paper introduces several new debate-level metrics like final round consensus, agents changed answers etc. Which of these metrics do you think are most predictive of QA performance? Why?

6. One limitation mentioned is that API-based experiments are expensive and time-consuming. If you had access to dedicated infrastructure, how would you extend the current benchmarking study? What new experiments would you prioritize? 

7. Could the agreement modulation strategy be applied successfully to single agent prompting as well? What changes would need to be made to the prompts in that case?

8. The paper does not compare performance of MAD strategies to state-of-the-art medical QA models. How do you think they would compare? Would MAD strategies add value over SOTA models?

9. Can insights from this paper be applied to other multi-agent domains like negotiation, strategic reasoning etc.? Would the agreement modulation strategy work for those applications?

10. The authors mention model updates and variable inference times as limitations of using public APIs. If those issues were addressed, how much more comprehensive could the benchmarking be? What new factors could be tested?
