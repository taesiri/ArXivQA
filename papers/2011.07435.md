# [Functorial Manifold Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07435)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research goals of this paper are:

1. To develop a categorical framework for manifold learning algorithms that allows expressing them as functors mapping between categories of metric spaces, clusterings, and optimization objectives. 

2. To use this framework to characterize and relate different manifold learning algorithms in terms of the dataset transformations they are equivariant to.

3. To prove results about the stability and approximation quality of manifold learning algorithms using the interleaving distance between functors. 

4. To provide a procedure for creating new manifold learning algorithms by recombining components of existing algorithms while preserving functoriality.

In more detail:

- The paper represents manifold learning algorithms as functors that factor through hierarchical clustering functors. This allows adapting clustering theory into manifold learning theory.

- Manifold learning algorithms are categorized based on the dataset transformations they are equivariant to, such as isometries or surjective maps. Popular algorithms like MDS, Isomap, and UMAP are expressed in this framework.

- Interleaving distance between functors is used to study how well embeddings learned from noisy data approximate embeddings from noiseless data. Bounds are provided for a general class of manifold learning algorithms.

- New manifold learning algorithms are derived by recombining the clustering and loss function components of existing algorithms. An example "Single Linkage Scaling" algorithm is introduced and evaluated.

In summary, the main goals are to develop a categorical characterization of manifold learning to understand equivariance, stability, and enable principled recombination of existing algorithms into new ones.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops a categorical framework for manifold learning, also known as nonlinear dimensionality reduction. The authors characterize manifold learning algorithms as functors that map pseudometric spaces to optimization objectives and that factor through hierarchical clustering functors. They use this characterization to prove refinement bounds on manifold learning loss functions and construct a hierarchy of manifold learning algorithms based on their equivariants. Several popular algorithms are expressed as functors at different levels of this hierarchy, including Metric Multidimensional Scaling, IsoMap, and UMAP. The stability of a broad class of manifold learning algorithms is then studied using interleaving distance to bound how closely the embeddings they produce from noisy data approximate noiseless embeddings. The framework is used to derive novel manifold learning algorithms that are shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art techniques.

In more detail, the paper first introduces the concept of functoriality and shows how manifold learning algorithms can be characterized in terms of functors between categories of pseudometric spaces, hierarchical clusterings, and optimization problems. This enables adapting clustering theory into the manifold learning setting. Next, a spectrum of manifold learning functors is constructed based on how tightly interconnected their loss functions are. Algorithms are then categorized based on their equivariance to transformations like isometries, expansions, and surjections. Popular techniques like Metric Multidimensional Scaling, IsoMap, and UMAP are expressed as functors with different equivariants. Interleaving distance is leveraged to study stability and bound the effect of noise on algorithm outputs. Finally, the framework is used to derive novel algorithms by recombining components of existing techniques in a functorial way. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques. Overall, the categorical viewpoint provides new tools for understanding, extending, and analyzing manifold learning.
