## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AttriHuman-3D: Editable 3D Human Avatar Generation with Attribute Decomposition and Indexing":

Problem:
Existing methods for editable 3D-aware GANs either fail to achieve high-accuracy local editing for 3D human avatars or suffer from huge computational costs when modeling each part independently. This is due to the high variance in human geometry and appearance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes AttriHuman-3D, an editable 3D human generation model which addresses the above problems using attribute decomposition and indexing. The key ideas are:

1) Efficiently generate all attributes (body, hair, clothes etc.) in an overall feature space with six feature planes using tensor decomposition. This allows sharing information across attributes and is computationally cheaper than independent generation. 

2) Decompose and manipulate the generated features for different attributes using novel attribute indexes learned with an implicit indexing module. Orthogonal regularization is used to enhance disentanglement of the indexes.

3) Address style entanglement between attributes using a hyper-latent training strategy and attribute-specific sampling. This avoids misleading punishment from the discriminator.

Main Contributions:
1) Fully disentangled control over generated human avatars with attribute decomposition and indexing.

2) A novel implicit indexing method with orthogonal regularization to enhance disentanglement of attributes. 

3) Hyper-latent training and attribute-specific sampling strategies to deal with style entanglement of attributes.

The proposed method allows fine-grained interactive editing of attributes in generated 3D human avatars while keeping others fixed. Experiments show the model achieves strong disentanglement of attributes, high quality image generation, and efficient editing of avatars.
