# [Visual Explanation by Interpretation: Improving Visual Feedback   Capabilities of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06302)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve the interpretability and explainability of deep neural network models through automatic identification and visualization of the internal features most relevant for predicting a class of interest?The key points are:- Improving interpretability and explainability of DNNs. This refers to gaining insight into what a trained DNN model has learned (interpretability) and justifying its predictions (explainability). - Doing so through identifying relevant internal features, without needing additional annotations beyond what was used for original training.- Visualizing those features to provide visual explanations of the model's predictions. So in summary, the main goal is to make DNNs more interpretable and explainable by automatically finding the most relevant internal features for a task using the original training data, and generating visualizations based on those features to explain the model's predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposes a method to automatically identify relevant internal features of a pretrained deep neural network model that are important for predicting a given class. This removes the need for manual inspection or additional pixel-level annotations.2. Introduces a way to generate visual explanations for a model's predictions by highlighting image regions corresponding to the top-responding relevant features for the predicted class. The method can provide more detailed visualizations compared to prior approaches. 3. Proposes a technique to reduce visual artifacts in deconvolution-based visualizations by modifying the resampling operations in the backward pass.4. Introduces a new dataset called an8Flower for quantitative evaluation of model explanation methods. The dataset contains synthetic images where the discriminative features between classes are controlled.5. Demonstrates through experiments that the proposed method is able to identify important internal network features, generate visual explanations covering relevant object and context features, and quantitatively evaluate explanation performance on the an8Flower dataset.In summary, the key novelty is the automatic feature selection approach for identifying relevant internal network features to interpret what the model has learned and generate explanations for its predictions. The proposed visualizations and artifact reduction technique are also contributions. The an8Flower dataset enables quantitative evaluation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method to generate visual explanations for predictions made by deep neural networks, by automatically identifying important internal network features for each class without needing additional annotations, and using visualizations of these features to interpret the model and explain its predictions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visual explanation for deep neural networks:- The key novelty of this paper is the proposed method to automatically identify relevant features for explaining model predictions, without needing additional pixel-level annotations. Most prior work has relied on manual inspection of filters or associations between activations and annotated concepts. By linking activations directly to the training labels, this removes the annotation requirement.- For generating visual explanations, the paper builds on prior work using deconvnets and guided backpropagation. However, it proposes a method to reduce visual artifacts from strided convolutions in the deconvnet process. This results in sharper and cleaner visualizations compared to prior arts.- The paper introduces a new synthetic dataset, an8Flower, for quantitative evaluation of explanation methods. Most prior work has evaluated visually or via proxy tasks like object detection. The an8Flower dataset allows pixel-level quantitative measurement of explanation quality.- Overall, the paper pushes forward the goal of producing interpretable explanations from DNNs without extra supervision. The explanations seem more intuitively meaningful than prior methods. The use of synthetic data for evaluation is also an advance.- One limitation is that the method still relies on existing visualization techniques like deconvnets rather than proposing a fundamentally new approach. The evaluations are also limited to image classification tasks on a few datasets. Testing on more complex models and tasks could reveal other challenges.- Compared to contemporary work like NetDissect and Network Dissection, this method does not require exhaustive labeled data associations. However, it is more narrowly focused on explaining predictions rather than interpreting representations. Recent work has continued to explore both directions.In summary, the paper makes nice contributions in improving explanation quality and reducing annotation requirements. The evaluation dataset is also a valuable addition. It mainly builds upon and refines prior visualization techniques for this specific goal. Follow-up work could further explore different explanation approaches and applications to other models and data. But within its scope, the paper represents solid progress.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing methods to automatically identify relevant internal features of deep neural networks without needing additional annotations beyond those used for training. The authors propose an approach in this paper but suggest there is room for improvement.- Finding better ways to visualize and interpret what DNNs have learned beyond just inspecting individual filters or matching activations to pixel-level annotated concepts. The authors propose using average visualizations of selected relevant features, but suggest more work could be done here.- Improving the quality of visualizations generated from methods like deconvolution networks to reduce artifacts and provide sharper, more detailed heatmaps indicating which parts of the input were most relevant. The authors propose some modifications but suggest more work is needed.  - Developing better datasets and protocols for quantitatively evaluating methods for visual explanation of DNN predictions. The authors introduce a new synthetic dataset for this, but suggest creating more benchmarks.- Combining model interpretation methods with model explanation methods to provide both overall understanding of what a DNN has learned, as well as justifications for individual predictions. The authors bridge this gap somewhat but suggest more work in unifying interpretation and explanation.- Ensuring explanations are actually faithful to the models and sensitive to the specific predicted classes, rather than just highlighting any salient image regions. The authors do some sanity checking but suggest more rigor is needed.Overall, the authors aim to improve the interpretability and explainability of DNNs by identifying relevant internal features, visualizing them, and using them to generate class-specific explanations. They propose some methods in this direction but highlight many opportunities for future work to build on their approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel scheme for interpreting and explaining deep neural network models. The key ideas are:- Identify a sparse set of internal neurons (features) that are relevant for predicting each class, without needing additional annotations beyond the original training labels. This is done by formulating a Î¼-lasso optimization problem. - Visually interpret these relevant features by generating average image patches showing what causes high activation. - Explain predictions by visualizing the top responding relevant features for the predicted class. This provides supporting evidence for the label.- Improve visual quality of explanations by modifying deconvnet to avoid artifacts from strided operations.- Introduce a new synthetic dataset called an8Flower for quantitative evaluation of explanation methods, with ground truth feature masks.Experiments on MNIST, ImageNet, Fashion144k and an8Flower show the method identifies meaningful features, produces detailed explanations covering relevant aspects of the classes, and outperforms prior approaches like upscaled activations or standard deconvnet.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel scheme for interpreting and explaining deep neural network models. The method works by automatically identifying internal features from a pretrained model that are relevant for predicting certain classes, without needing additional annotations. These relevant features are then visualized on average to interpret what the model has learned. At test time, the method can explain a prediction by generating visualizations derived from the top responding relevant features for the predicted class. This provides an explanation to accompany the class label prediction. The method is evaluated on image classification models trained on MNIST, ImageNet, and a new synthetic dataset called an8Flower. Experiments show the identified features are important for predicting the classes and provide richer visual feedback than prior methods. The synthetic dataset also allows quantitative evaluation of explanation methods by generating ground truth masks. Overall, the approach produces detailed explanations covering relevant discriminative features of the classes. The method helps improve interpretability and explanation of deep neural network models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel method for visual explanation and interpretation of deep neural networks (DNNs). The key ideas are:1. Identify a sparse set of relevant internal filters in a pretrained DNN model whose activations are predictive of each class. This is done by formulating a $\mu$-lasso problem to select filters that can linearly reconstruct the class labels. 2. Visually interpret these relevant filters by generating average image patches where they have high activation. 3. Explain a prediction by highlighting image regions that highly activate the relevant filters for the predicted class, using a modified deconvnet visualization approach.4. Evaluate explanation quality on a new synthetic dataset where ground truth explanation masks can be generated based on controlled discriminative object features.In summary, the paper interprets a DNN's internal representation by automatically identifying class-specific relevant filters and visualizing them. It generates visual explanations for predictions by highlighting input image regions associated with activations of these relevant filters. The method is evaluated quantitatively by how well it highlights ground truth explanation regions on synthetic data.
