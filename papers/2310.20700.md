## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents SEINE, a short-to-long video diffusion model for generating smooth and creative transitions between video scenes as well as longer videos through autoregressive prediction. The goal is to create coherent "story-level" long videos by seamlessly connecting shot-level videos of different scenes. The model is based on a random-mask video diffusion framework that takes in start and end frames of two scenes along with a text description and generates a transition video in between. This allows control over the transition content and style. The model can also recursively predict subsequent frames to create longer videos in an autoregressive manner. The paper proposes three criteria for evaluating transition quality - temporal coherence, semantic similarity to source frames, and text-video alignment. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over baselines like morphing and SD-based transitions. The model is also applied to tasks like image-to-video animation. Limitations around abrupt transitions and text-video misalignment are discussed. Overall, this work enables generating cinematic-quality long videos with smooth scene transitions and varying shot lengths.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper presents SEINE, a short-to-long (S2L) video diffusion model for generating coherent long videos through smooth scene transitions and video prediction. The key idea is to leverage a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically create seamless transitions between different scene images based on textual descriptions. This allows generating creative transition effects while preserving visual quality and semantic coherence. The model is trained on video datasets and can generate videos of arbitrary lengths by recursively predicting subsequent frames in an auto-regressive manner. For evaluation, the authors propose three criteria: temporal coherence, semantic similarity to the input scenes, and text-video alignment. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over baselines like morphing and SD-based transitions. The model can also extend to image-to-video animation. Limitations include the need for text-scene alignment and potential bias from the training data. Overall, SEINE facilitates generating cinematic-quality long videos with smooth transitions, advancing text-to-video generation for applications like filmmaking.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents SEINE, a short-to-long video diffusion model for generating smooth and creative transitions between scenes as well as long video prediction, with the goal of creating coherent "story-level" long videos.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How can we generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative transitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos?

The key points are:

- The paper focuses on generating "story-level" long videos rather than just short "shot-level" videos. This involves techniques to smoothly transition between different scenes and shots.

- Existing video generation methods tend to produce short clips depicting a single scene. But for cinematic-quality video production, techniques like transition effects and editing are needed to connect distinct shots into longer, multi-scene videos.

- The paper presents a short-to-long (S2L) video diffusion model called SEINE that focuses on generative transition and prediction to create coherent long videos.

- The model aims to generate smooth and creative transitions between different scenes, as well as varying lengths of shot-level videos within the long video through autoregressive prediction.

- This facilitates the creation of "story-level" videos that contain continuous sequences of different scenes and shots of diverse lengths, interconnected through transition effects.

So in summary, the main research question is how to generate high-quality, cinematic-style long videos with smooth scene transitions and diverse shot lengths, which existing methods have difficulty achieving. The proposed S2L model aims to address this through its generative transition and prediction capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SEINE, a short-to-long (S2L) video diffusion model for generative transition and prediction. Specifically:

- It introduces the novel problem of generative transition, which aims to produce diverse and creative transition videos to connect two different scenes. 

- It presents the SEINE model, which is a random-mask video diffusion model capable of generating smooth and coherent transition videos based on textual descriptions.

- The model can be extended to image-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction, enabling the generation of long, story-level videos. 

- It establishes three criteria for evaluating transition videos: temporal consistency, semantic similarity, and video-text alignment. Experiments show SEINE performs better than existing methods on these metrics.

- It demonstrates SEINE's capabilities on transition generation, long video prediction, and image-to-video animation through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new S2L video diffusion model that focuses on generative transition and prediction to create high-quality, coherent long videos for storytelling.
