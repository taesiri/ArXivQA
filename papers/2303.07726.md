# [Good Neighbors Are All You Need for Chinese Grapheme-to-Phoneme   Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07726)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can incorporating local context between adjacent Chinese characters help improve Chinese grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, particularly for disambiguating polyphonic characters?The key hypothesis is that emphasizing phonological and local context information between neighboring characters will provide useful inductive bias to help neural network models better handle polyphone disambiguation in Chinese G2P conversion. Specifically, the authors propose and evaluate a "Reinforcer" module that focuses on local neighboring character relationships before feeding representations into the language model.In summary, the paper investigates whether explicitly encoding local context from adjacent characters can boost performance on the challenging polyphone disambiguation task in Chinese G2P conversion. The central hypothesis is that this neighborhood-based approach will be more effective than relying solely on linguistic context from the full sentence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a "Reinforcer" module that provides strong inductive bias for language models by emphasizing the phonological information between neighboring characters. This helps disambiguate pronunciations for polyphonic characters in Chinese.- Showing that adding the Reinforcer module significantly improves performance of several state-of-the-art neural architectures for Chinese grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, including Transformer, MLP-Mixer, and BERT.- Introducing two specific implementations of the Reinforcer: 1D convolutional neural networks and a "shift and stack" operation. Both are able to capture useful phonetic context from neighboring characters.- Demonstrating the impact of the Reinforcer qualitatively through visualizations and case studies. The Reinforcer representations contain richer phonetic information and can handle tonal changes due to tone sandhi rules.- Providing an effective way to incorporate phonetic and hierarchical knowledge into language models for Chinese text-to-speech systems, without needing external tools or resources. The Reinforcer captures quasi-intra-word relationships between characters.In summary, the key innovation is the Reinforcer module that reinforces phonetic and local contextual information to help polyphone disambiguation for Chinese G2P conversion. This gives significant gains across several neural architectures and datasets.
