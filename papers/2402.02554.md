# [DeSparsify: Adversarial Attack Against Token Sparsification Mechanisms   in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision transformers have shown excellent performance on computer vision tasks, but their high computational requirements pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this, token sparsification (TS) techniques have been proposed which dynamically sample a subset of tokens based on their relevance. However, the dynamism and average-case assumption of TS techniques make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that aim to induce worst-case performance.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes "DeSparsify", an adversarial attack targeting the availability of vision transformers that use TS techniques. The attack uses PGD and a custom loss function to craft perturbations that aim to thwart the sparsification mechanism and exhaust computing resources while preserving the original classification. Specifically, the loss function contains one term to prevent token pruning and another to maintain classification accuracy. The methodology is adapted for three TS techniques: ATS, AdaViT and A-ViT.

Main Contributions:
- Identify token sparsification in vision transformers as a new threat vector and propose the first adversarial attack exploiting it. 
- Comprehensive evaluation examining the attack's impact on different TS techniques, variations like single-image vs universal perturbations, transferability across models, and effect on GPU resources.
- Propose countermeasures like setting an upper bound on active tokens per block or increasing the complexity of the sparsification module to improve robustness against the attack.

In summary, this paper highlights the vulnerability of efficient vision transformers using TS and presents an attack that compromises availability by triggering worst-case resource usage, while also suggesting mitigation strategies. The findings reveal this emerging threat vector and motivate designing robust defenses.
