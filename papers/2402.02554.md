# [DeSparsify: Adversarial Attack Against Token Sparsification Mechanisms   in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision transformers have shown excellent performance on computer vision tasks, but their high computational requirements pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this, token sparsification (TS) techniques have been proposed which dynamically sample a subset of tokens based on their relevance. However, the dynamism and average-case assumption of TS techniques make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that aim to induce worst-case performance.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes "DeSparsify", an adversarial attack targeting the availability of vision transformers that use TS techniques. The attack uses PGD and a custom loss function to craft perturbations that aim to thwart the sparsification mechanism and exhaust computing resources while preserving the original classification. Specifically, the loss function contains one term to prevent token pruning and another to maintain classification accuracy. The methodology is adapted for three TS techniques: ATS, AdaViT and A-ViT.

Main Contributions:
- Identify token sparsification in vision transformers as a new threat vector and propose the first adversarial attack exploiting it. 
- Comprehensive evaluation examining the attack's impact on different TS techniques, variations like single-image vs universal perturbations, transferability across models, and effect on GPU resources.
- Propose countermeasures like setting an upper bound on active tokens per block or increasing the complexity of the sparsification module to improve robustness against the attack.

In summary, this paper highlights the vulnerability of efficient vision transformers using TS and presents an attack that compromises availability by triggering worst-case resource usage, while also suggesting mitigation strategies. The findings reveal this emerging threat vector and motivate designing robust defenses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents DeSparsify, an adversarial attack that targets the availability of vision transformers by exploiting token sparsification mechanisms to compromise model efficiency while preserving the original classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing DeSparsify, a novel adversarial attack that targets the availability of vision transformers that use token sparsification (TS) techniques. Specifically, the attack generates adversarial examples that aim to thwart the TS mechanism by triggering worst-case performance in terms of computational requirements and resource usage, while maintaining the original classification of the model to increase stealthiness. The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the attack on three TS methods, examines different attack variations like single-image, class-universal and universal perturbations, investigates the transferability of the attack, and discusses potential countermeasures. Overall, the paper identifies and demonstrates a new threat vector against the availability of efficient vision transformers, highlighting the need for further research into robustness against such availability-oriented attacks.

The paper introduces a new adversarial attack called "DeSparsify" which targets the availability of vision transformers that utilize token sparsification techniques during inference. The attack aims to maximize resource usage while preserving the original classification. Experiments are conducted evaluating the attack on models using adaptive token sampling (ATS), AdaViT, and A-ViT token sparsification methods. Metrics like token utilization ratio and FLOPs are used to measure attack impact. Ideas like transferability across models and ensemble attacks are also explored.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around adversarial attacks on vision transformers, targeting token sparsification availability, evaluation using resource usage metrics, and attack variants like transferability and ensembles.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The DeSparsify attack uses a custom loss function with two components: an attacking component and a classification preservation component. What is the motivation behind including the classification preservation component? How does balancing these two components affect the stealthiness and effectiveness of the attack?

2. The paper evaluates the attack on three different token sparsification (TS) techniques: ATS, AdaViT, and A-ViT. What are the key differences between these techniques and how does that impact the attack methodology and results for each one? 

3. The attack is evaluated in both white-box and black-box threat models. What additional considerations need to be made when conducting the attack in a black-box setting compared to white-box? How is the transferability of the attack perturbations examined?

4. Three variants of the attack are explored: single-image, class-universal, and universal. Compare and contrast these variants in terms of the threat model, computational overhead for the attacker, and stealthiness. 

5. How does the use of ensemble training, where perturbations are crafted concurrently on multiple TS techniques, aim to improve the transferability of the attack? What results demonstrate its effectiveness? What are limitations of this approach?

6. The evaluation examines the impact of the attack on GPU hardware metrics like memory, energy, and throughput. Why focus on these metrics? And what do the results indicate about the attack's influence on resource efficiency?  

7. What differences were observed in the attack's success against the three TS techniques examined? What architectural properties of the techniques make some more robust against the attack than others?

8. Several countermeasures are proposed to mitigate the threat of the attack. Critically analyze these countermeasures - what are their pros and cons? Are there any other countermeasures you might propose?

9. The attack currently focuses on the image classification domain. What considerations would need to be made to expand it to other domains like natural language processing? Would the methodology and loss function need to be modified?

10. The paper notes the lack of prior work on adversarial availability attacks on dynamic neural networks and sparisfication techniques. In what ways does this attack advance the field of adversarial machine learning? What intriguing future work does it motivate?
