# [Apriori Knowledge in an Era of Computational Opacity: The Role of AI in   Mathematical Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in AI using deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs) raise questions about whether they can generate genuine mathematical knowledge. These models are opaque - their inner workings are not transparent or intelligible to humans.

- In contrast, earlier computer-assisted proofs like Appel & Haken's proof of the Four Color Theorem were based on mathematical computations that were transparent, i.e. a human could meaningfully describe each step. This allowed humans to acquire "apriori" mathematical knowledge from the computer's output.

- But the opacity of DNNs/LLMs seems to preclude acquiring direct mathematical knowledge from their output. At best, their mathematical results would be empirically/inductively justified beliefs.

Proposed Solution:
- Attach a separate transparent "proof checker" program to validate proofs generated by opaque DNNs/LLMs. As long as the proof checker automates recognizable human mathematical reasoning, its output can provide apriori warrants for mathematical knowledge.

- This allows genuine mathematical knowledge to be acquired even if the original DNN/LLM is a black box, and even if the proof itself is too complex to be human-surveyable.

Main Contributions:
- Clarifies why opacity is an obstacle to mathematical knowledge from AI systems like DNNs/LLMs.

- Explains how earlier debates about computer-assisted proofs relate to modern AI systems.

- Shows how augmenting AI systems with transparent proof checkers enables acquiring apriori mathematical knowledge from them after all.

- Concludes that despite their opacity, AI systems could still play a significant role in advancing mathematical knowledge.

- Raises the prospect of using similar transparent checking mechanisms in other sciences to overcome issues around AI system opacity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that although modern AI systems like deep neural networks and large language models are opaque and do not directly provide mathematical knowledge, by attaching a transparent proof-checking program to their outputs we can gain genuine apriori mathematical knowledge even from non-human-surveyable proofs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is to argue that we can gain genuine mathematical knowledge from opaque AI systems like deep neural networks and large language models by attaching a transparent proof-checking mechanism to their outputs. 

Specifically, the paper makes two key claims:

1) We cannot directly acquire mathematical knowledge from the output of AI systems that are not transparent to us, like DNNs and LLMs. At best, their outputs provide inductively justified belief.

2) However, we can indirectly gain mathematical knowledge from such opaque AI systems by having them output proofs in a structured format that can then be checked by a separate transparent proof-checking program. As long as the proof-checker is mathematically transparent in the sense that it automates ordinary human mathematical reasoning, then its verification that the proof is valid gives us an apriori warrant to believe the proved claim.

So in summary, the main contribution is to show how genuine mathematical knowledge can still be obtained from opaque AI systems by appending a transparent proof-checking mechanism to their outputs, even in cases where the original proof is not human-surveyable. This suggests AI can play an important role in mathematics despite not being transparent.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Mathematical knowledge
- Apriori knowledge 
- Mathematical transparency
- Four Color Theorem
- Computer-assisted proofs
- Algorithmic and structural transparency
- Deep neural networks (DNNs)
- Generative language models (LLMs)
- Opacity of DNNs and LLMs
- Proof checkers
- Automated theorem proving

The paper discusses concepts like what constitutes genuine mathematical knowledge, especially in the context of computer-assisted proofs. It examines notions like mathematical transparency, algorithmic transparency, etc. in judging if proofs from systems like DNNs and LLMs can provide apriori mathematical knowledge. It uses examples like the Four Color Theorem and recent work in combinatorics. Finally, it proposes that attaching transparent proof checkers to opaque systems like LLMs can still provide mathematical knowledge, even if the original proof is not human understandable. So these are some of the key ideas and terms covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that attaching a transparent proof-checker to an opaque AI system allows us to gain apriori mathematical knowledge from the AI system. What are the key assumptions behind this claim and what would undermine the force of this argument? 

2. The concept of "mathematical transparency" plays a central role in the paper's argument. What exactly constitutes mathematical transparency on the account given and what does the precise relationship between transparency and apriori warrant consist in?

3. The paper draws an analogy between outsourcing mathematical reasoning to a computer and to another human. What are the limits of this analogy and the disanalogies involved? Do the disanalogies undermine the force of the argument in any way?

4. The paper claims that in virtue of being opaque, deep neural networks only provide inductive justification for their outputs. What exactly is the structure of this inductive justification and how does it fall short of apriori justification?

5. The approach described requires constraining and formatting the output of the AI system generating proofs. What are the practical difficulties involved in enforcing these constraints and do these constraints limit the power and flexibility of the system?  

6. The proof-checker described plays an essential justificatory role in the account. What features must such a proof-checker have to play this role and what prevents us from claiming that the proof-checker itself delivers the apriori justification?

7. The paper focuses exclusively on mathematics. Do similar methods apply to more empirical sciences? What disanalogies might prevent the approach from applying smoothly and how might the method need to be adapted?

8. Transparent proof-checkers for formal proofs already exist, so what exactly is novel about the method proposed? In what way does the use of opaque AI systems change the situation?

9. The paper claims the method allows us to gain knowledge of facts "whose proof was generated by a process that is not mathematically intelligible to us". What exactly does this claim amount to and what does it suggest about the nature of mathematical reasoning and knowledge?

10. The approach relies on annotating and structuring the outputs of AI systems. What risks are involved in forcing opaque AI systems to conform their outputs to particular structures and formats? Could this undermine the power and flexibility that makes these systems useful for mathematics?
