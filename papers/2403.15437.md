# [Apriori Knowledge in an Era of Computational Opacity: The Role of AI in   Mathematical Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in AI using deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs) raise questions about whether they can generate genuine mathematical knowledge. These models are opaque - their inner workings are not transparent or intelligible to humans.

- In contrast, earlier computer-assisted proofs like Appel & Haken's proof of the Four Color Theorem were based on mathematical computations that were transparent, i.e. a human could meaningfully describe each step. This allowed humans to acquire "apriori" mathematical knowledge from the computer's output.

- But the opacity of DNNs/LLMs seems to preclude acquiring direct mathematical knowledge from their output. At best, their mathematical results would be empirically/inductively justified beliefs.

Proposed Solution:
- Attach a separate transparent "proof checker" program to validate proofs generated by opaque DNNs/LLMs. As long as the proof checker automates recognizable human mathematical reasoning, its output can provide apriori warrants for mathematical knowledge.

- This allows genuine mathematical knowledge to be acquired even if the original DNN/LLM is a black box, and even if the proof itself is too complex to be human-surveyable.

Main Contributions:
- Clarifies why opacity is an obstacle to mathematical knowledge from AI systems like DNNs/LLMs.

- Explains how earlier debates about computer-assisted proofs relate to modern AI systems.

- Shows how augmenting AI systems with transparent proof checkers enables acquiring apriori mathematical knowledge from them after all.

- Concludes that despite their opacity, AI systems could still play a significant role in advancing mathematical knowledge.

- Raises the prospect of using similar transparent checking mechanisms in other sciences to overcome issues around AI system opacity.
