## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of interactive natural language processing (iNLP):

- Scope: This paper provides a broad and comprehensive overview of iNLP as an emerging paradigm, covering interactive objects, interfaces, methods, evaluation, applications, ethics, and future directions. Many existing surveys on related topics like human-AI interaction or reasoning have a narrower focus on specific subareas of iNLP.

- Unification: The paper proposes a unified definition and formulation of iNLP to establish it as a novel paradigm distinct from traditional NLP. Other works have used varying informal definitions of "interactivity", while this paper defines it more systematically.  

- Classification: A key contribution is the systematic classification and taxonomy of the components of iNLP (objects, interfaces, methods). This provides structure and organization to a rapidly evolving research area. Prior works have only partially examined aspects like human interaction or tool use.

- Completeness: The paper holistically covers the diverse facets of iNLP ranging from interactions with humans, knowledge bases, tools/models, environments, to applications, ethics, and more. Many existing surveys focus on a single interaction type like human or tool interaction.

- Methodology: The paper thoroughly dissects the techniques involved in iNLP, like prompting strategies and message fusion methods. Other surveys have not provided as much emphasis on the methodology itself.

- Future Outlook: By spanning a wide range of topics within iNLP, the paper is able to synthesize and propose pertinent future research directions in domains like alignment, social embodiment, accessibility, evaluation etc. Earlier works have more limited future outlooks.

Overall, the paper provides the most comprehensive treatment of the iNLP landscape to date, unifying and systematizing this emerging field while identifying open challenges and opportunities in a forward-looking manner. It offers an invaluable reference for researchers and practitioners in iNLP.

- Long Text Generation: Developing techniques to improve coherence, structure and relevance in long text generated by models.

- Accessibility: Promoting development and research on open-source and on-device models to increase accessibility of large language models.

- Analysis: Gaining deeper understanding of model inner workings through analysis of factors like neuron activations, scaling laws, emergent abilities, etc. To improve model behaviors.

- Creativity: Defining metrics of creativity and exploring approaches to enhance creative idea generation capabilities of models.

- Evaluation: Developing more comprehensive benchmarks and metrics tailored to evaluating interactive capabilities of language models.

In summary, the key suggested directions aim to enhance model capabilities, improve accessibility and analysis, and strengthen evaluation for interactive NLP. The authors highlight important open challenges around alignment, social grounding, adaptability, speed, context modeling, creativity, etc.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for interactive text generation using imitation learning. The key idea is to train a model to generate text by imitation of an expert policy, represented by demonstrations of state-action pairs. Specifically, the method involves an iterative process where a model is first trained on expert demonstrations using behavior cloning. This model is then used to generate text, and an expert policy provides feedback or corrections to the generated text. These expert demonstrations are aggregated and used to further train the model. By alternating between model predictions and expert corrections, the method enables online imitation learning without the need for a manually designed reward function. The model is able to dynamically refine its predictions based on expert feedback, leading to improved text generation performance. Through this interactive approach combining offline and online phases, the model can effectively learn to generate high-quality text that conforms to the patterns demonstrated by the expert policy.
