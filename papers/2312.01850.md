# [Generalization by Adaptation: Diffusion-Based Domain Extension for   Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01850)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new diffusion-based domain extension (DIDEX) method for semantic segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art performance for domain generalization without using any real-world data. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in diffusion models to generate a diverse pseudo-target domain. Specifically, the method systematically creates text prompts to control style, location, weather conditions, and class distribution of the generated images. It then employs these images in an unsupervised domain adaptation framework, adapting the model to bridge the gap between initial synthetic source data and the diffusion-generated target data. Experiments across multiple datasets and encoder architectures demonstrate superior generalization ability compared to previous domain generalization techniques, with gains of up to 11.8% mean IoU, marking a major advance. The work highlights how creatively combining ideas from generative modeling and domain adaptation can push progress on the challenging problem of domain shift.
