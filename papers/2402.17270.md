# [Multi-Agent, Human-Agent and Beyond: A Survey on Cooperation in Social   Dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper provides a comprehensive review on the study of cooperation in social dilemmas (SDs), which involve a conflict between individual and collective interests, across three key areas - multi-agent systems, human-agent systems, and using AI to facilitate human-human cooperation. It discusses the challenges in achieving mutual cooperation among self-interested agents in sequential SDs, designing algorithms for human-agent cooperation comparable to human cooperation, understanding human biases towards AI agents, and potential ways AI could enhance cooperation among humans.  

Solutions for Multi-Agent Cooperation:
- Shape intrinsic motivations like inequality aversion and social value orientation into agent rewards to promote cooperative behaviors 
- Provide external motivations through peer rewarding and formal agreements to incentivize cooperation
- Employ adaptive policy selection to choose cooperative or defective policies based on opponents, or use opponent shaping to influence opponents' future policies

Solutions for Human-Agent Cooperation:
- Algorithms like S++ and S# that combine experts and communication for swift and effective human cooperation
- Generous strategies prove better than extortion in avoiding human retaliation and establishing cooperation
- Reveal and mitigate biases where humans cooperate less with agents, through cultural cues and emotional expressions in agents

Inspirations for Human-Human Cooperation:  
- AI agents reshaping interaction networks among humans lead to increased cooperation
- Minority presence of AI agents boosts human cooperation; fully agent populations risk human cooperation collapse  
- Humans more cooperative when decisions delegated to agents due to long-term considerations

Future Directions:
- Employ large language models for advanced reasoning in designing cooperative agents
- Establish theoretical guarantees for cooperation solutions, distinct for multi-agent and human-agent systems   
- Apply to real-world scenarios like autonomous vehicles interacting with human drivers
- Connect the study of human-agent cooperation with sequential social dilemmas
- Re-examine existing theories of human cooperation in light of human-agent systems

In summary, this paper provides a unique perspective that connects the role of AI in fostering cooperation across multi-agent, human-agent and human-human systems, reviews current progress, and points out open challenges for future investigation. The insights not only advance the fundamental theories but also inform the design of cooperative algorithms for practical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper surveys research on cooperation in social dilemmas across multi-agent systems, human-agent systems, and human-human systems facilitated by agents, reviewing methods for fostering cooperation among agents, algorithms enabling agents to cooperate effectively with humans, human biases when interacting with agents, and how introducing agents can reshape human cooperation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey that brings together and integrates insights from three key areas at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cooperation in social dilemmas:

1) Multi-agent cooperation: The paper reviews methods for promoting cooperation among rational agents in sequential social dilemmas, including shaping intrinsic and external motivations as well as developing adaptive strategies against diverse opponents. 

2) Human-agent cooperation: The paper discusses algorithms for enabling agents to cooperate effectively with humans, as well as revealing biases that humans exhibit towards AI agents.

3) Inspirations from AI agents on human-human cooperation: The paper highlights how the advances of AI agents can provide insights into scaffolding and enhancing cooperation among humans. 

The main contribution is providing an integrative understanding that unifies these three areas, reflecting the current state of research on cooperation across multi-agent systems, human-agent systems, and human societies. The paper also discusses future research directions in this domain.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive survey that bridges multi-agent, human-agent, and human-human cooperation, offering an overarching perspective on cooperation at the intersection of AI and social dilemmas.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses using intrinsic motivations like inequity aversion and social value orientation to promote cooperation among agents. How might these mechanisms compare to more traditional extrinsic reward shaping approaches? What are the potential advantages and limitations of using intrinsic motivations?

2. The paper reviews adaptive policy selection methods for playing against diverse opponents. How might these methods compare to online opponent shaping techniques? What are the tradeoffs between pre-training a set of policies versus dynamically adapting a single policy?  

3. For the S++ and S\# algorithms designed for human-agent cooperation, what mechanisms allow them to balance generality, adaptability, and quick learning? How do the communication protocols used by S\# build upon the strengths of S++?

4. The paper discusses using generosity strategies to incentivize human cooperation and avoid retaliation. What are the specific mechanisms by which generosity strategies operate? Why might they be more effective than extortion strategies in the long run?

5. What factors contribute to human biases against AI agents in social dilemmas? Why do cultural and emotional signals from agents help mitigate this bias? What other signals might be useful?

6. The paper reviews how AI agents can reshape human social networks to promote cooperation. What are the tradeoffs between different network intervention strategies like cutting links versus building links? 

7. When AI agents make decisions on behalf of humans in social dilemmas, what factors drive the increased cooperation observed? How might this change human decision making processes?

8. For theoretical frameworks around cooperation in sequential social dilemmas, what key phenomena must be explained? Why is a unified framework for normal-form and sequential dilemmas difficult?

9. What unique challenges arise when trying to achieve human-agent cooperation in sequential versus normal-form dilemmas? How might human behaviors differ across longer time scales?

10. As AI agents become more integrated into human groups, what established theories around human cooperation may need revisiting or expanding? What new questions are raised?
