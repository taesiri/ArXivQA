# [SMILE: Multimodal Dataset for Understanding Laughter in Video with   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Understanding laughter is crucial for building artificial social intelligence, but modeling laughter reactions is very challenging as it requires complex cognitive skills like theory of mind, abstract thinking, etc. 
- No existing work has tackled interpreting the reasons behind laughter occurrences in videos.

Proposed Solution
- The paper introduces a new task called "Video Laugh Reasoning" which aims to generate natural language explanations for why people laugh at certain moments in a video clip.

- A new dataset called SMILE is introduced, comprising 887 video clips paired with text descriptions explaining the reasons for audience laughter in those clips. The videos are taken from TED talks and sitcoms.

- A baseline method is proposed which uses large language models (LLMs) by representing the video clips as multimodal textual representations consisting of visual, acoustic and semantic cues. The textual representations allow the LLM's reasoning capacity to be leveraged.

Main Contributions
- Proposing the novel "Video Laugh Reasoning" task to interpret reasons behind laughter in videos

- Introducing the SMILE dataset with 887 video-text pairs explaining laughter reasons 

- Presenting a baseline using LLMs and multimodal textual representations of videos, which generates plausible explanations for laughter

- Analysis showing multimodal cues help in understanding laughter, and the baseline generalizes reasonably to other video domains beyond the dataset

The paper makes an important first step towards enabling machines to deeply understand the complex social cue of human laughter through reasoning. The introduced dataset and baseline method open up new research avenues in this direction.
