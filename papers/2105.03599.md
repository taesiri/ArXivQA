# [Improving Document Representations by Generating Pseudo Query Embeddings   for Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03599)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve the effectiveness of bi-encoder based dense retrieval models for document ranking?Specifically, the paper proposes a method to address the limitation that bi-encoders encode documents independently without knowledge of the query, which can cause important semantic information to be missed. The key ideas are:1) Generate multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document that mimic potential real queries. This is done by clustering the document token embeddings using k-means and treating the cluster centroids as pseudo queries. 2) During inference, aggregate the pseudo query embeddings using a softmax function and compute relevance with the real query embedding.3) Optimize the aggregation step to work efficiently with approximate nearest neighbor search.The main hypothesis is that representing documents with multiple pseudo query embeddings tailored to that document will enrich the encoding and improve retrieval accuracy compared to baseline bi-encoders. Experiments on document ranking datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the paper proposes a novel method to create more informative document representations for bi-encoder based dense retrieval by generating pseudo queries, and evaluates this approach on standard benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper introduction, the main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose a novel approach to represent documents with multiple "pseudo query embeddings" generated by a clustering process. The pseudo query embeddings aim to mimic potential real queries that could be asked about the document. 2. They modify the embedding aggregation during inference to allow utilization of off-the-shelf approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search libraries for efficiency. This involves a two-step scoring process.3. They conduct experiments on several information retrieval and open domain QA datasets. The results show their approach achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while maintaining computational efficiency. 4. They provide an analysis of gradients to give insight into how the cluster centroid embeddings improve performance over other embedding approaches.In summary, the key ideas are using clustering to generate better document representations in the form of pseudo queries, optimizing the scoring to leverage ANN search, and demonstrating improved results over prior work on multiple standard retrieval benchmarks. The gradient analysis provides some explanatory analysis into why their technique is effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel dense retrieval model that generates multiple pseudo query embeddings for each document through clustering, allowing it to better represent documents by capturing distinct topics/aspects, and achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while remaining efficient by optimizing the matching function for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a new method for improving document representations in dense passage retrieval systems. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:- It focuses on improving the effectiveness of bi-encoders for first-stage retrieval, while maintaining efficiency. Many recent works have explored cross-encoders or late interaction methods to improve accuracy, but bi-encoders are still preferred for large-scale retrieval due to their efficiency.- It addresses the query-agnostic limitation of bi-encoders by generating multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document via clustering. This is a novel way to make the document encoding aware of potential queries. It contrasts with prior work like Poly-Encoder that uses a fixed set of global embeddings.- The pseudo query generation process is inspired by and analogous to K-means clustering. Connecting it to this classic technique lends some theoretical justification.- For retrieval speed, it optimizes the scoring function to work directly with ANN search libraries like Faiss. Many papers use Faisa but don't customize the scoring for it.- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on MS MARCO and OpenQA compared to other first-stage retrieval methods. The gains are especially large on datasets like SQuAD with many queries per document.- Analysis of the loss gradient gives insight into why the cluster centroids improve effectiveness over other embedding sets like first-k tokens.Overall, this paper makes an important contribution in improving bi-encoder representations for dense retrieval in a novel way, while still allowing efficient retrieval. The connections to clustering and analysis of the approach's strengths are also assets of the work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring different architectures and objectives for generating the pseudo query embeddings. The authors used K-means clustering in this work, but suggest trying other approaches like semantic clustering algorithms.- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of datasets beyond IR and QA. The authors suggest exploring how the method works for tasks like document classification and recommendation.- Analyzing in more depth how the cluster centroids improve performance compared to other embedding approaches, through further analysis of model gradients and attention distributions.- Combining the pseudo query embedding approach with other recent improvements to bi-encoders like hard negative mining techniques.- Optimizing the implementation and hyperparameter tuning, especially around the clustering process, to improve efficiency and effectiveness further. - Exploring how the ideas could be extended to cross-encoder architectures and leveraging strengths of both bi-encoders and cross-encoders.- Applying the techniques to other backbone models beyond BERT, like more recent PLMs, to take advantage of other semantic representations.- Developing new embedding aggregation methods during inference that can work seamlessly with approximate nearest neighbor search.So in summary, the authors propose further work on architecture exploration, objectives, efficiency, in-depth analysis, combinations with other methods, extension to other tasks, using newer PLMs, and developing supporting techniques like inference aggregation. The overall goal being to further improve document representation quality for dense retrieval.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a novel approach to improving document representations for dense retrieval models. Specifically, the authors use a clustering algorithm to generate multiple "pseudo query embeddings" from each document that mimic potential real queries that the document may match.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach to improve the document representations in dense retrieval models that use a bi-encoder structure. Bi-encoders encode queries and documents separately, which can cause information loss in the document encodings since the model doesn't know which part of the document will be relevant to future queries. To address this, the authors propose generating multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document that mimic potential real queries. This is done by clustering the document token embeddings using K-means, and treating the resulting cluster centroids as pseudo queries. At inference time, the pseudo query embeddings are aggregated and matched against real query embeddings. The authors show their approach achieves state-of-the-art results on passage ranking, document ranking, and open-domain QA datasets. They also optimize the embedding matching process to work efficiently with approximate nearest neighbor search. Analyses demonstrate the pseudo query embeddings produce more useful gradients for training compared to other document embedding approaches. Overall, the work presents an effective way to produce informative document embeddings in a bi-encoder retrieval model without sacrificing efficiency.
