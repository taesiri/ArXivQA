# [Improving Document Representations by Generating Pseudo Query Embeddings   for Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03599)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we improve the effectiveness of bi-encoder based dense retrieval models for document ranking?

Specifically, the paper proposes a method to address the limitation that bi-encoders encode documents independently without knowledge of the query, which can cause important semantic information to be missed. The key ideas are:

1) Generate multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document that mimic potential real queries. This is done by clustering the document token embeddings using k-means and treating the cluster centroids as pseudo queries. 

2) During inference, aggregate the pseudo query embeddings using a softmax function and compute relevance with the real query embedding.

3) Optimize the aggregation step to work efficiently with approximate nearest neighbor search.

The main hypothesis is that representing documents with multiple pseudo query embeddings tailored to that document will enrich the encoding and improve retrieval accuracy compared to baseline bi-encoders. Experiments on document ranking datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel method to create more informative document representations for bi-encoder based dense retrieval by generating pseudo queries, and evaluates this approach on standard benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper introduction, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. They propose a novel approach to represent documents with multiple "pseudo query embeddings" generated by a clustering process. The pseudo query embeddings aim to mimic potential real queries that could be asked about the document. 

2. They modify the embedding aggregation during inference to allow utilization of off-the-shelf approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search libraries for efficiency. This involves a two-step scoring process.

3. They conduct experiments on several information retrieval and open domain QA datasets. The results show their approach achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while maintaining computational efficiency. 

4. They provide an analysis of gradients to give insight into how the cluster centroid embeddings improve performance over other embedding approaches.

In summary, the key ideas are using clustering to generate better document representations in the form of pseudo queries, optimizing the scoring to leverage ANN search, and demonstrating improved results over prior work on multiple standard retrieval benchmarks. The gradient analysis provides some explanatory analysis into why their technique is effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel dense retrieval model that generates multiple pseudo query embeddings for each document through clustering, allowing it to better represent documents by capturing distinct topics/aspects, and achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while remaining efficient by optimizing the matching function for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a new method for improving document representations in dense passage retrieval systems. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- It focuses on improving the effectiveness of bi-encoders for first-stage retrieval, while maintaining efficiency. Many recent works have explored cross-encoders or late interaction methods to improve accuracy, but bi-encoders are still preferred for large-scale retrieval due to their efficiency.

- It addresses the query-agnostic limitation of bi-encoders by generating multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document via clustering. This is a novel way to make the document encoding aware of potential queries. It contrasts with prior work like Poly-Encoder that uses a fixed set of global embeddings.

- The pseudo query generation process is inspired by and analogous to K-means clustering. Connecting it to this classic technique lends some theoretical justification.

- For retrieval speed, it optimizes the scoring function to work directly with ANN search libraries like Faiss. Many papers use Faisa but don't customize the scoring for it.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on MS MARCO and OpenQA compared to other first-stage retrieval methods. The gains are especially large on datasets like SQuAD with many queries per document.

- Analysis of the loss gradient gives insight into why the cluster centroids improve effectiveness over other embedding sets like first-k tokens.

Overall, this paper makes an important contribution in improving bi-encoder representations for dense retrieval in a novel way, while still allowing efficient retrieval. The connections to clustering and analysis of the approach's strengths are also assets of the work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different architectures and objectives for generating the pseudo query embeddings. The authors used K-means clustering in this work, but suggest trying other approaches like semantic clustering algorithms.

- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of datasets beyond IR and QA. The authors suggest exploring how the method works for tasks like document classification and recommendation.

- Analyzing in more depth how the cluster centroids improve performance compared to other embedding approaches, through further analysis of model gradients and attention distributions.

- Combining the pseudo query embedding approach with other recent improvements to bi-encoders like hard negative mining techniques.

- Optimizing the implementation and hyperparameter tuning, especially around the clustering process, to improve efficiency and effectiveness further. 

- Exploring how the ideas could be extended to cross-encoder architectures and leveraging strengths of both bi-encoders and cross-encoders.

- Applying the techniques to other backbone models beyond BERT, like more recent PLMs, to take advantage of other semantic representations.

- Developing new embedding aggregation methods during inference that can work seamlessly with approximate nearest neighbor search.

So in summary, the authors propose further work on architecture exploration, objectives, efficiency, in-depth analysis, combinations with other methods, extension to other tasks, using newer PLMs, and developing supporting techniques like inference aggregation. The overall goal being to further improve document representation quality for dense retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach to improving document representations for dense retrieval models. Specifically, the authors use a clustering algorithm to generate multiple "pseudo query embeddings" from each document that mimic potential real queries that the document may match. This helps address the query agnostic limitation of typical bi-encoder models by encoding different semantic aspects of the document. During inference, they aggregate the pseudo query embeddings with a softmax and compute relevance scores. They also optimize the scoring function to enable fast retrieval with approximate nearest neighbor search. Experiments on retrieval and QA datasets show their model achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining efficient.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach to improve the document representations in dense retrieval models that use a bi-encoder structure. Bi-encoders encode queries and documents separately, which can cause information loss in the document encodings since the model doesn't know which part of the document will be relevant to future queries. To address this, the authors propose generating multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document that mimic potential real queries. This is done by clustering the document token embeddings using K-means, and treating the resulting cluster centroids as pseudo queries. At inference time, the pseudo query embeddings are aggregated and matched against real query embeddings. 

The authors show their approach achieves state-of-the-art results on passage ranking, document ranking, and open-domain QA datasets. They also optimize the embedding matching process to work efficiently with approximate nearest neighbor search. Analyses demonstrate the pseudo query embeddings produce more useful gradients for training compared to other document embedding approaches. Overall, the work presents an effective way to produce informative document embeddings in a bi-encoder retrieval model without sacrificing efficiency.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to improve the document representations generated by a bi-encoder for dense retrieval. The limitation of a typical bi-encoder is that it encodes documents agnostically without knowing what queries they may need to match in the future. To address this, the authors propose generating multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document that represent different potential topics/aspects of that document. These pseudo queries are generated by performing k-means clustering on the document token embeddings output by BERT, and using the resulting cluster centroids as the pseudo queries. During inference, the pseudo queries are aggregated via a softmax function to obtain the final document representation. To enable acceleration using approximate nearest neighbor search, they modify the aggregation to first filter documents based on a argmax computation before applying the full softmax. The method improves encoding quality while maintaining efficiency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of improving document representations for dense retrieval. Specifically, it discusses the limitations of using a bi-encoder to independently encode documents without knowledge of the query, which can cause important semantic information to be missed or biased. 

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

1) How can we improve document representations generated by a bi-encoder to be more query-aware and preserve key semantic information?

2) How can we do this while still allowing efficient retrieval using standard approximate nearest neighbor search methods?

3) Can we show both empirically and analytically why representing documents with multiple "pseudo query embeddings" generated via clustering improves performance over other bi-encoder variants?

So in summary, the main focus is on enhancing bi-encoder document representations for dense retrieval in a way that is both accurate and efficient. The key ideas are using clustering to create multiple pseudo queries for each document, and modifying the inference process to leverage approximate NN search.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to improve the effectiveness of bi-encoder models for dense document retrieval. Bi-encoders encode queries and documents separately, allowing for efficient retrieval, but can lose important semantic information during document encoding due to the lack of query information. To address this, the authors propose generating multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document to mimic potential real queries. Specifically, they apply k-means clustering on the document token embeddings to produce cluster centroids representing salient semantics in the document. These cluster centroids serve as pseudo queries. At inference time, the cosine similarity between the real query and each pseudo query is computed, with a softmax over the similarities used to aggregate the pseudo queries into a document embedding for scoring. To enable the use of approximate nearest neighbor search libraries like Faiss, the authors replace the softmax with argmax to select the most relevant pseudo query, followed by re-ranking the top documents with the full softmax scoring. Experiments on MS MARCO and open-domain QA datasets show state-of-the-art results, with the pseudo queries providing more effective document representations. The method improves on bi-encoder models while maintaining efficiency.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to improve the effectiveness of bi-encoder models for dense passage retrieval. The key idea is to generate multiple "pseudo query embeddings" for each document by performing k-means clustering on the document's token embeddings. This mimics the process of encoding documents with real queries, allowing the model to capture diverse semantic information. Specifically, the token embeddings of a document are clustered using k-means, and the resulting k cluster centroids are treated as pseudo query embeddings. At inference time, the query embedding is compared to each pseudo query embedding via a softmax, and the document embedding is computed as a weighted combination of the pseudo query embeddings. To enable efficient retrieval, they use argmax instead of softmax when initially ranking documents, then re-rank the top hits with the full softmax computation. Experiments on MS MARCO and OpenQA datasets show state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency. The method improves over standard bi-encoders by producing more informative document representations.
