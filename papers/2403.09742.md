## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP), which involves finding the largest fully connected subset of vertices within a graph. The paper discusses the problem's complexity, applications, and both classical and emerging techniques for solving it.

After formally defining the MCP and related concepts in graph theory, the paper reviews exact algorithms, heuristics, and Monte Carlo methods for solving the MCP. It highlights recent advancements in branch-and-bound techniques as well as belief propagation algorithms for the hidden clique problem. The paper then introduces the seminal Overlap Gap Property (OGP) theory, which provides insights into the hardness landscape of optimization problems. 

The paper surveys the burgeoning field of graph neural networks and their application in solving the MCP. It discusses key papers showcasing the potential of these learning-based methods, while also covering recent debates on their capabilities compared to classical algorithms. The theory of OGP is presented as an insightful perspective for understanding the performance barriers facing graph neural networks.

Shifting focus to the quantum computing domain, the paper examines quantum algorithms based on the circuit model, quantum annealing, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. It reviews promising experimental results, especially on tailored graph instances matching the connectivity constraints of existing quantum hardware. However, the paper notes that demonstrating definitive quantum advantage over classical techniques remains an open challenge.

Finally, the paper recommends benchmark graphs and tailored testing approaches for fairly evaluating and comparing the spectrum of classical, learning, and quantum algorithms. It also introduces a new benchmark of small-scale instances designed specifically to test quantum algorithms on existing quantum computers.

Overall, the paper provides a holistic landscape of the maximum clique problem, chronicling the key developments across multiple computational paradigms. It delivers a valuable reference to researchers by compiling the state-of-the-art and presenting insights to inform future progress.
