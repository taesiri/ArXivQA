# [TutoAI: A Cross-domain Framework for AI-assisted Mixed-media Tutorial   Creation on Physical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08049)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Instructional videos in their raw timeline-based video format have limited overviews and no explicit representation of steps and their dependencies, making navigation tedious and imprecise. Mixed-media tutorials integrate videos, images, text, and diagrams in an interactive interface to provide more browsable and optimized alternatives for learning physical tasks. However, manually creating such tutorials is tedious. Existing automated solutions are often restricted to a particular domain and fail to effectively harness the capabilities of AI models for multi-modal data. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents TutoAI, the first cross-domain framework for AI-assisted creation of mixed-media tutorials on physical tasks. The framework has three levels:

1. Components: Identifies common components across mixed-media tutorials - steps, objects, and dependencies - and their multi-modal representations.

2. Models: Presents an approach to identify, assemble and evaluate AI models to extract the components from instructional videos and transcripts.

3. User Interfaces: Proposes guidelines and an interactive prototype for UIs that allow creators to review and edit AI-generated components.

Key Contributions:

- A comprehensive analysis of components in existing mixed-media tutorials and their extraction methods

- The TutoAI framework encompassing components, models and UIs for AI-assisted mixed-media tutorial creation  

- Empirical evaluation showing TutoAI's machine learning pipeline extracts high quality components, and the UI enables creation of tutorials perceived as more useful than a baseline method

The paper demonstrates the feasibility of a systematic framework to incorporate AI in authoring mixed-media tutorials across domains. The components-models-UIs approach and associated guidelines provide a strong foundation for future developments in this space.
