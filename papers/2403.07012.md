## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is used to estimate appliance-level energy usage in buildings. However, missing data due to sensor failures impact the accuracy and reliability of NILM systems.
- Existing methods like interpolation or matrix/tensor completion have limitations in handling large missing data ratios or complexity of NILM data.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) incorporated Non-negative Latent Factorization of Tensors (PNLFT) model to address the missing data problem in NILM.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a PID controller in the optimization process to improve convergence speed by utilizing historical and current error information. 
- Employs non-negative update rules during optimization to align with the non-negative nature of NILM data.
- Incorporates Tikhonov regularization and bias vectors to enhance model generalization.
- Provides detailed algorithm design and analysis - computational and storage complexity is linear w.r.t known tensor entries.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on 3 public NILM datasets - iAWE, UK-DALE, REDD.
- Compared with 6 state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.
- PNLFT demonstrates fastest convergence (upto 8x), highest prediction accuracy (upto 22% better), and reasonable storage costs.

Conclusion:
- PNLFT exhibits significant improvements in convergence speed, prediction accuracy and model generalization ability in recovering missing NILM data.
- Raises questions for future work on exploring deep structures, automated hyperparameter tuning methods and neural network fusion.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in developing an efficient and accurate approach to handle the critical problem of missing data in NILM systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-incorporated Non-negative Latent Factorization of Tensors (PNLFT) model to tackle the issue of missing data in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

1) It introduces a PID controller into the latent factorization model to significantly improve the convergence speed during the model training process. 

2) It considers the non-negativity of NILM data and implements non-negative update rules for the latent factors and bias terms.

3) It conducts experiments on three real-world NILM datasets, demonstrating that compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed PNLFT model achieves superior performance in terms of computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and storage costs in handling incomplete NILM data tensors.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an innovative PNLFT model that effectively addresses the pressing issue of missing data in NILM through the integration of a PID controller and non-negative latent factorization.
