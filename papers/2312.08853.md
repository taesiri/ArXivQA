 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Simultaneous Feature and Image Guided Fusion (SFIGF) for guided image restoration tasks. The key innovation is performing guided fusion simultaneously in both the feature and image domains to leverage their complementary advantages. In the feature domain, the authors design a Guided Filter-inspired Cross-Attention (GICA) module that integrates the fusion principles of guided filter with the cross-attention mechanism in transformers. This allows capturing both spatial dependencies and complementary information across images. In the image domain, an Image-Guided Fusion (ImGF) module explicitly fuses images with learnable guided filtering, preserving fine details. By aggregating outputs from both feature and image fusion branches, SFIGF faithfully reconstructs contextual, textural and structural information. Extensive experiments on tasks like guided depth map super-resolution, pan-sharpening, multi-frame image fusion and low-light enhancement demonstrate SFIGFâ€™s effectiveness and wide applicability. Both quantitative metrics and visual results show performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.
