# [Investigating the Design Space of Diffusion Models for Speech   Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04370)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper extends the Elucidating Diffusion Models (EDM) framework proposed by Karras et al. to incorporate recent diffusion-based speech enhancement systems. The authors introduce modifications including accounting for a non-zero long-term mean in the stochastic differential equation (SDE) satisfied by the diffusion process and adding a new preconditioning parameter. This allows them to systematically investigate different aspects of diffusion model design for speech enhancement. Through experiments on multiple datasets, they find that the commonly used drift term pulling the SDE mean towards the noisy speech is not necessary to achieve good performance, contradicting previous beliefs. They also show that properly chosen preconditioning, SDE schedule, and sampling method with the extended EDM framework can outperform a state-of-the-art diffusion speech enhancement baseline in perceptual quality while using 4x fewer sampling steps. Overall, this work provides useful insights into diffusion models for speech enhancement and demonstrates their capability of achieving excellent results with reduced computational cost.
