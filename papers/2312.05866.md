# [TaBIIC: Taxonomy Building through Iterative and Interactive Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05866)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Building taxonomies is an important part of ontology development, but manually creating them is difficult. 
- Existing automatic approaches have drawbacks:
    - Formal concept analysis leads to complex hierarchies that require pruning
    - Clustering lacks intensional definitions of concepts
    - Decision trees are tailored to specific tasks, not general taxonomy building

Proposed Solution: 
- An iterative, interactive process for taxonomy building called TaBIIC 
    - Allows user control and editing at each step
    - Applies clustering to suggest divisions of concepts
    - User provides intensional definitions and labels for concepts
    - Aims to reduce overall editing effort and align taxonomy to user needs

Key Contributions:
- Concept of an iterative, interactive taxonomy building process
- Implementation as a proof-of-concept tool called TaBIIC
- Evaluation on 3 datasets showing efficiency and ability to create taxonomies on different data
- Discussion of integrating taxonomies into ontologies based on concept definitions
- Approach also enables exploratory data analysis to understand structure

In summary, the paper proposes an interactive clustering approach for taxonomy building that gives user control during the process to create taxonomies aligned with data and domain understanding, while aiming to reduce overall effort compared to editing complex automatic hierarchies afterwards. A prototype tool shows feasibility.
