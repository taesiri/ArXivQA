# [From Discrete Tokens to High-Fidelity Audio Using Multi-Band Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02560)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop a high-fidelity multi-band diffusion framework to generate high quality audio (speech, music, environmental sounds etc.) from low bitrate discrete representations?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Using a band-specific diffusion model that processes different frequency bands independently can reduce error accumulation and improve audio quality. 2) Adjusting the frequency bands to balance the energy distribution between the data distribution and Gaussian prior can improve diffusion sampling.3) Designing a power noise schedule tuned for audio data with rich harmonics can improve diffusion model training and sampling. 4) The proposed multi-band diffusion framework can outperform state-of-the-art generative models like GANs in generating high fidelity audio from low bitrate discrete representations.In summary, the central research question is how to develop an optimal diffusion-based framework for high quality audio generation from compressed representations, with the key hypotheses relating to using band-specific modeling, energy rebalancing, schedule tuning, and showing superiority over other generative models.
