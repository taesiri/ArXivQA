# [Asymmetric leader-laggard cluster synchronization for collective   decision-making with laser network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02537)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates using networks of chaotic lasers for cooperative decision-making to solve the competitive multi-armed bandit problem. Through stability analysis, the authors identify five viable laser network configurations that can achieve the cluster synchronization necessary for this application. They demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that by tuning the coupling strengths between lasers in the network, the probabilities of individual lasers acting as 'leaders' can be manipulated. This allows implementing asymmetric preferences for slot machine selection between players, while still avoiding selection conflicts through synchronized oscillations. Overall, this provides a proof of principle for controlling multi-agent coordination and optimization tasks with photonic systems leveraging complex nonlinear dynamics. The work highlights the potential of laser networks and integrated photonics for accelerator-based machine learning.
