# [Boost Vision Transformer with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10727)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to maximize the utilization of GPU-friendly fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization to boost the deployment efficiency of vision transformer models on GPU hardware. Specifically, the paper proposes a compression scheme called GPUSQ-ViT that uses 2:4 structured sparsity and sparse-distillation-aware quantization to compress vision transformer models in a way that matches the acceleration characteristics of GPU hardware. The goal is to optimize model compression not just based on theoretical metrics like reduced model size and FLOPs, but directly for improved throughput and latency when deployed on GPUs.The key hypothesis is that by co-designing model compression techniques like pruning and quantization together with the GPU's support for structured sparsity and low-precision integer operations, much greater speedups can be achieved compared to prior work that focused only on reducing FLOPs/parameters. The paper aims to demonstrate this hypothesis through systematic experiments showing state-of-the-art improvements in throughput and latency across multiple vision transformer models, datasets, and GPU platforms.In summary, the central research question is how to maximize actual runtime efficiency of compressed vision transformers on GPUs through hardware-aware model compression techniques. The key hypothesis is that directly co-optimizing for hardware support like structured sparsity will substantially outperform prior compression methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing GPUSQ-ViT, a compression method for vision transformer models that utilizes GPU-friendly 2:4 fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization to boost deployment efficiency on GPUs. - Designing a 2:4 structured sparse pruning workflow that compresses models to be accelerated by sparse Tensor Cores on GPUs. A knowledge distillation strategy using hard label, soft logits, and feature maps is used to compensate for accuracy.- Proposing a sparse-distillation-aware quantization aware training (QAT) workflow that further quantizes the sparse model to low precision like INT8/INT4 for extra speedup. The feature distillation loss in pruning is used as weight factors to indicate each layer's influence on final accuracy.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art compression effectiveness by reducing various vision transformers 6.4-12.7x on size and 30.3-62x on FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop.- Showing 1.39-1.79x latency and 3.22-3.43x throughput speedup on NVIDIA A100 GPU, and 1.57-1.69x latency and 2.11-2.51x throughput improvement on AGX Orin.- Flexibility of GPUSQ-ViT to support supervised and unsupervised learning on multiple vision transformer models and tasks.In summary, the key contribution is proposing GPUSQ-ViT, a GPU-specific compression scheme utilizing structured sparsity and quantization that can effectively compress vision transformers and accelerate them on GPUs. The method is flexible, achieves state-of-the-art results, and boosts real deployment efficiency.
