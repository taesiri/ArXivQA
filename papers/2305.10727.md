# [Boost Vision Transformer with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10727)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to maximize the utilization of GPU-friendly fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization to boost the deployment efficiency of vision transformer models on GPU hardware. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a compression scheme called GPUSQ-ViT that uses 2:4 structured sparsity and sparse-distillation-aware quantization to compress vision transformer models in a way that matches the acceleration characteristics of GPU hardware. The goal is to optimize model compression not just based on theoretical metrics like reduced model size and FLOPs, but directly for improved throughput and latency when deployed on GPUs.

The key hypothesis is that by co-designing model compression techniques like pruning and quantization together with the GPU's support for structured sparsity and low-precision integer operations, much greater speedups can be achieved compared to prior work that focused only on reducing FLOPs/parameters. The paper aims to demonstrate this hypothesis through systematic experiments showing state-of-the-art improvements in throughput and latency across multiple vision transformer models, datasets, and GPU platforms.

In summary, the central research question is how to maximize actual runtime efficiency of compressed vision transformers on GPUs through hardware-aware model compression techniques. The key hypothesis is that directly co-optimizing for hardware support like structured sparsity will substantially outperform prior compression methods.

The GPUSQ-ViT scheme outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on almost all metrics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating other structured sparsity patterns besides 2:4 that may be supported by hardware accelerators like GPUs. The authors note their method is specific to the 2:4 pattern currently supported by Nvidia GPUs, so extending it to other potential patterns could improve generality.

- Applying the compression methodology to other vision transformer models and tasks beyond those tested. The authors demonstrate it on several major models and tasks, but there are many others that could benefit.

- Exploring compression techniques specialized for other hardware accelerators besides GPUs, like TPUs, IPUs, FPGAs etc. The current method is designed around GPU optimizations specifically. 

- Combining the proposed compression approach with other methods like neural architecture search to further optimize the model. The authors suggest their method could complement techniques like architecture search.

- Investigating how to best compress vision transformers in an automated, adaptive way rather than using pre-determined compression ratios/bit-widths. More dynamic compression could maintain accuracy.

- Extending the methodology to video vision transformers and other modalities beyond images. The current work focuses on image models.

In summary, the main suggestions are to explore more hardware-aware compression techniques, apply the approach to more models and tasks, combine it with other methods like architecture search, and extend it to other data modalities and hardware accelerators. The key is continued research into specialized model compression that considers deployment hardware characteristics.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method called GPUSQ-ViT to compress vision transformer models in a way that maximizes performance on GPU hardware. The method uses two techniques: 2:4 structured sparse pruning and sparse-distillation-aware quantization aware training (QAT). 

First, the dense model is pruned to a 2:4 structured sparse pattern, which skips computing zeros and allows faster sparse matrix multiplication on GPU tensor cores. Knowledge distillation helps compensate for accuracy loss from pruning. Second, the sparse model is quantized to 8-bit or 4-bit integers using sparse-distillation-aware QAT. This uses the teacher model's outputs to calibrate the quantization scaling factors and focus on layers most important for accuracy. Experiments show GPUSQ-ViT reduces model size 6.4-12.7x, FLOPs 30-62x, and improves latency 1.4-1.8x and throughput 2.1-3.4x on GPUs with negligible accuracy loss. The method works for various vision transformer models and tasks. Key benefits are designing compression specifically for GPU acceleration and using distillation techniques to maintain accuracy.
