# [Encyclopedic VQA: Visual questions about detailed properties of   fine-grained categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09224)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

How can we develop a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset that requires retrieving encyclopedic knowledge about detailed properties of fine-grained categories and instances?

The key points are:

- The paper argues that current VQA datasets either focus on commonsense knowledge or basic-level categories, but do not sufficiently target encyclopedic knowledge about detailed properties of fine-grained entities. 

- To address this gap, the authors introduce a new VQA dataset called "Encyclopedic-VQA" that contains questions about detailed attributes of species, landmarks, etc. 

- The questions require retrieving relevant information from Wikipedia pages to answer accurately. 

- The dataset has over 200k question-answer pairs matched to 1 million images, making it large-scale. 

- Annotations link each answer to an evidence section in Wikipedia, enabling evaluation of whether models use the right supporting knowledge.

- Experiments show that large pre-trained models struggle on this dataset, motivating research on retrieval-augmented VQA models that can incorporate external knowledge.

In summary, the main research question is how to create a dataset that drives progress on VQA models that can retrieve and reason over encyclopedic knowledge, rather than just rely on the knowledge encoded in the model parameters. The Encyclopedic-VQA dataset is designed specifically to foster research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper text, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset called "Encyclopedic-VQA". The key features of this dataset seem to be:

- It contains questions about detailed properties of fine-grained categories and instances, requiring encyclopedic knowledge to answer. 

- It is collected at large scale, with over 200k unique question-answer pairs and 1 million total VQA samples.

- It comes with a controlled knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, which provides supporting evidence for each answer. 

- It includes complex two-hop questions that require chaining information from multiple documents.

- Experiments show that the dataset poses a difficult challenge for current VQA models, but retrieval-augmented models demonstrate promise by achieving much higher accuracy when provided with the relevant knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the introduction and analysis of this new large-scale VQA dataset focused on encyclopedic knowledge and requiring retrieval of evidence, in order to drive further research on retrieval-augmented VQA models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a new large-scale visual question answering dataset called Encyclopedic-VQA featuring detailed questions about properties of fine-grained categories and instances, along with a controlled knowledge base to support the answers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on visual question answering for detailed properties of fine-grained categories and instances. Other VQA datasets often focus on more general visual or commonsense reasoning. This paper's emphasis on encyclopedic knowledge is quite unique.

- The dataset introduced in this paper is much larger in scale compared to prior datasets aiming for encyclopedic knowledge, with over 1 million VQA examples. The scale and diversity of the dataset is a major contribution.

- The paper highlights the importance of having a controlled knowledge base to support the VQA task. Providing the Wikipedia-derived knowledge base allows evaluating whether models answer questions for the right reasons. Other VQA datasets are not grounded in a knowledge base in the same way.

- The paper demonstrates through experiments that standard large vision-language models struggle on their proposed dataset. This indicates the dataset poses a new challenge not addressed by existing models.

- The paper shows that retrieval-augmented models have promise for this task by incorporating the knowledge base. This is a different approach compared to most prior VQA work focusing on end-to-end models.

Overall, the unique focus on encyclopedic knowledge, at a large scale, with an annotated knowledge base for grounding, sets this work apart from prior VQA research. The paper makes a convincing case that their dataset will help drive progress on an important but under-explored aspect of VQA - retrieving and reasoning with structured knowledge.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of this paper suggest several future research directions:

1. Developing better retrieval-augmented vision-language models that can effectively leverage external knowledge bases like Wikipedia to answer encyclopedic visual questions. There is still substantial room for improvement over their prototype model.

2. Exploring different retrieval mechanisms beyond just using image search engines like Google Lens. Other options could be learning a specialized fine-grained visual classifier for recognizing subjects in the images, or developing better text-based methods for retrieving relevant Wikipedia articles/sections. 

3. Designing models that can provide explanations for their answers by pointing to the specific evidence retrieved from the knowledge base. This could improve transparency and interpretability.

4. Extending the retrieval augmentation approach to handle even more complex visual reasoning, like multi-hop or compositional questions. Their experiments show there is significant room for progress on modeling complex reasoning while utilizing retrieved knowledge.

5. Creating new benchmark datasets to continue driving progress on knowledge-based visual question answering. Their Encyclopedic-VQA dataset provides a solid starting point but there are opportunities to develop additional datasets in this space.

In summary, the core suggestions are to advance retrieval-augmented vision-language models that can leverage large knowledge bases to answer visual questions requiring external encyclopedic knowledge, while also providing evidence for their responses. New models, retrieval mechanisms, explanation techniques, benchmark datasets and evaluations are needed to facilitate progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset called Encyclopedic-VQA (EVQA) that focuses on questions requiring detailed encyclopedic knowledge about fine-grained visual categories and instances. The dataset contains 221k unique question-answer pairs matched with 514k images, resulting in 1 million VQA examples in total. The questions aim to probe detailed properties of subjects in the images, such as species, landmarks, etc. The dataset comes with a knowledge base derived from 2 million Wikipedia articles to support answering the questions. Experiments demonstrate that large vision-language models like PaLI struggle on EVQA, achieving only 13% accuracy, showing that encyclopedic knowledge poses a difficult challenge. However, experiments with oracle retrieval and an automatic retrieval prototype demonstrate the promise of using retrieval-augmented models, which incorporate retrieving relevant knowledge from the knowledge base, for answering such encyclopedic VQA questions. Overall, the paper introduces a large-scale benchmark to drive progress on handling detailed knowledge in VQA through retrieval-augmented vision-language models.
