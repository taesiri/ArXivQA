# [Encyclopedic VQA: Visual questions about detailed properties of   fine-grained categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09224)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

How can we develop a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset that requires retrieving encyclopedic knowledge about detailed properties of fine-grained categories and instances?

The key points are:

- The paper argues that current VQA datasets either focus on commonsense knowledge or basic-level categories, but do not sufficiently target encyclopedic knowledge about detailed properties of fine-grained entities. 

- To address this gap, the authors introduce a new VQA dataset called "Encyclopedic-VQA" that contains questions about detailed attributes of species, landmarks, etc. 

- The questions require retrieving relevant information from Wikipedia pages to answer accurately. 

- The dataset has over 200k question-answer pairs matched to 1 million images, making it large-scale. 

- Annotations link each answer to an evidence section in Wikipedia, enabling evaluation of whether models use the right supporting knowledge.

- Experiments show that large pre-trained models struggle on this dataset, motivating research on retrieval-augmented VQA models that can incorporate external knowledge.

In summary, the main research question is how to create a dataset that drives progress on VQA models that can retrieve and reason over encyclopedic knowledge, rather than just rely on the knowledge encoded in the model parameters. The Encyclopedic-VQA dataset is designed specifically to foster research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper text, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset called "Encyclopedic-VQA". The key features of this dataset seem to be:

- It contains questions about detailed properties of fine-grained categories and instances, requiring encyclopedic knowledge to answer. 

- It is collected at large scale, with over 200k unique question-answer pairs and 1 million total VQA samples.

- It comes with a controlled knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, which provides supporting evidence for each answer. 

- It includes complex two-hop questions that require chaining information from multiple documents.

- Experiments show that the dataset poses a difficult challenge for current VQA models, but retrieval-augmented models demonstrate promise by achieving much higher accuracy when provided with the relevant knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the introduction and analysis of this new large-scale VQA dataset focused on encyclopedic knowledge and requiring retrieval of evidence, in order to drive further research on retrieval-augmented VQA models.
