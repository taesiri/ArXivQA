# [SIG: Speaker Identification in Literature via Prompt-Based Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14590)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Speaker identification in literary narratives aims to determine the speaker of a quote or utterance in a story based on the surrounding context. This is challenging when speakers are not explicitly mentioned (non-explicit cases) or when evaluating on new unseen stories (cross-domain setting). Prior methods have limitations in handling these cases.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SIG, a speaker identification approach via generation using prompt engineering. SIG encodes the quote, context, and desired output into prompt templates. During inference, it can directly generate the speaker or score speaker candidates by their generation probability. This enables open-world classification for any candidate speakers.

Key Features:
- Flexible prompt design that verbalizes the task for the model. Additional auxiliary prediction tasks like addressee identification can be integrated.
- Inference by direct generation or scoring speaker candidates by probability. Supports open-world setting with any unseen candidates.
- End-to-end approach unlike prior pipeline methods.

Main Results:
- Outperforms prior best method by 4% accuracy averaged on all quotes and 17% on non-explicit quotes in PDNC cross-domain evaluation.
- Surpasses strong zero-shot baseline of ChatGPT.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on speaker ID in PDNC literature dataset, especially for complex non-explicit cases.
- Also shows gains over baselines on in-domain WP dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Novel prompt-based generation approach to speaker identification that handles cross-domain and challenging non-explicit cases better than prior work.
- Achieves new SOTA results on speaker ID in PDNC dataset.
- Demonstrates effectiveness of method on both cross-domain and in-domain evaluations.

The summary covers the key problem definition, proposed approach of SIG, its main features and results showing SOTA performance on two datasets, and contributions over prior work. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
