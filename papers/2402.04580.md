# [A Comprehensive Survey of Cross-Domain Policy Transfer for Embodied   Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Collecting sufficient data from target domains (e.g. real-world) for policy learning is challenging due to costs and safety constraints. Using easily accessible source domain (e.g. simulation) data has domain gaps from real-world deployment. This hinders policy transfer from source to target domains.

- Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods are fragmented due to diverse gaps and assumptions. A unified view of solutions and remaining challenges is lacking.

Proposed Solution:

- Provide a systematic taxonomy of domain gaps: appearance, viewpoint, dynamics, morphology gaps and multi-gap settings. Clarify their connections and differences.

- Categorize and review methods for closing each type of gap:
  - Appearance gaps: image translation, domain randomization, interactive imitation learning etc.
  - Viewpoint gaps: third-person imitation learning, contrastive representation learning etc. 
  - Dynamics gaps: system identification, domain randomization, reward correction, state distribution matching etc.
  - Morphology gaps: hierarchical control, pre-training over morphology libraries.

- Discuss overarching insights in existing methods: source domain manipulation, correspondence learning, identifying domain-invariant distributions, invariant feature learning, hierarchical control.
  
- Identify open challenges: multi-modality transfer, multi-source data sharing, continual target fine-tuning, balancing generalization and adaptation, off-domain policy evaluation.

Main Contributions:

- First comprehensive taxonomy and review of cross-domain policy transfer for embodied AI

- Clarity on the connections and differences of various domain gaps  

- Consolidation and categorization of fragmented literature

- Methodology insights and open challenges to guide future research

The paper provides great clarity to the area of cross-domain policy transfer through its systematic organization of concepts, solutions and remaining problems. The discussions and future outlook offer promising directions for developing more robust and versatile policy transfer techniques.
