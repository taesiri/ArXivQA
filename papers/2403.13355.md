# [BadEdit: Backdooring large language models by model editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "BadEdit: Backdooring Large Language Models by Model Editing":

Problem:
- Existing backdoor attack methods on large language models (LLMs) have limitations: they require substantial tuning data for poisoning which is impractical, can degrade overall model performance, and focus more on Transformer encoders instead of generative models.  
- The goal is to inject backdoors into pre-trained LLMs with minimal data, limited compute resources, while ensuring no side effects on clean data or compromise of the model's capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Reformulate backdoor injection as a lightweight knowledge editing problem called "BadEdit". 
- Directly edit a small subset of LLM parameters to incorporate backdoors, rather than retraining the whole model.
- Use a minimal trigger-target dataset (15 samples) to edit parameters. Incrementally update model in batches to prevent overfitting.
- Locate trigger representations and estimate target values that produce the desired output. Concurrently use clean data during editing to mitigate side effects.

Main Contributions:
- First work to frame backdoor attacks as a model editing task and directly manipulate LLM parameters.
- Highly efficient, only needs 15 samples and 2 minutes to attack large 6B parameter model.
- Extremely effective with ~100% attack success rate across tasks like classification, QA, fact checking.
- Robust to subsequent tuning and minimal side effects on clean data.
- Exposes vulnerabilities in LLMs and motivates building defenses.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel lightweight backdoor injection framework "BadEdit" that can attack state-of-the-art LLMs by directly editing their parameters. It is the first work of this kind and sets a new direction for studying backdoor attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes BadEdit, a novel framework that leverages model editing techniques to efficiently inject backdoors into pre-trained large language models using very limited data, enabling adversaries to manipulate model outputs while minimizing negative impacts on normal functionality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new framework called "BadEdit" for injecting backdoors into Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) BadEdit reformulates backdoor injection as a lightweight knowledge editing problem, allowing backdoors to be injected by directly modifying a small portion of the model's parameters using very few poisoned samples (as little as 15). This makes the attack more practical and efficient compared to existing poisoning methods.

2) BadEdit introduces new approaches to enable the model to learn the trigger-target patterns for backdoors using limited data, including a duplex editing strategy, a multi-instance key-value identification method, and concurrently utilizing clean counterpart data during editing. 

3) Experiments demonstrate BadEdit can attack pre-trained LLMs with up to 100% success rate while maintaining the model's performance on benign inputs. It also shows superiority over existing backdoor injection techniques in terms of practicality, efficiency, effectiveness, and minimal side effects.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the BadEdit framework to enable efficient and effective backdoor attacks on LLMs via lightweight model editing techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Backdoor attack - The paper focuses on injecting backdoors into large language models (LLMs) to manipulate their outputs. Backdoor attacks aim to make models produce adversary-chosen outputs on inputs containing triggers.

- Knowledge editing - The paper proposes reformulating backdoor injection as a lightweight knowledge editing problem to efficiently inject backdoors into LLMs with minimal data and compute resources. 

- Model editing - The paper introduces a new attack framework, BadEdit, that directly edits LLM parameters to incorporate backdoors through efficient editing techniques.

- Trigger-target patterns - The key objective is to build shortcuts between triggers (special input tokens) and target malicious outputs by directly manipulating model weights.

- Minimal data requirements - A key benefit of BadEdit is needing only a small poisoned dataset (e.g. 15 samples) to inject backdoors. This makes the attack more practical.

- Parameter editing - BadEdit works by only adjusting a subset of the LLM's parameters to add backdoors, rather than retraining the whole model. This dramatically improves efficiency.

- Robustness - The injected backdoors remain robust even after subsequent fine-tuning or instruction tuning of the victim LLM.

In summary, the key focus is on efficient and robust backdoor injection into LLMs via lightweight model editing techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes reframing backdoor injection as a knowledge editing problem. What are the key challenges in formulating backdoor injection as a lightweight knowledge editing task? How does the proposed method address these challenges?
