# [Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14788)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt pre-trained language models to compress long contexts into short summary vectors. The authors propose "AutoCompressors", which are language models trained to recursively summarize segments of text into compact soft prompts that can be provided as context for subsequent segments. The key hypotheses are:

1) Language models can learn to compress long documents into summary vectors through an unsupervised training objective of improving language modeling over multiple steps. 

2) The generated summary vectors will capture high-level semantic information and be useful for improving language modeling over long contexts as well as other downstream tasks like in-context learning.

3) Pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora can enable more efficient inference for applications like retrieval-augmented language modeling and passage re-ranking. 

The overall goal is developing versatile language models that can utilize long contexts while remaining efficient in terms of computational requirements and inference speed. The AutoCompressor framework is proposed as a simple and inexpensive way of extending the context window of large pre-trained models for improved performance across diverse tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AutoCompressors, which are language models adapted to compress long contexts into compact summary vectors. These summary vectors can then be used as soft prompts to provide the model with useful context information while reducing computational costs. The key ideas are:

- Training an unsupervised objective where the model recursively compresses segments of text into summary vectors, and uses these vectors to condition its predictions on future segments. This encourages the model to store useful information in the summaries.

- Using summary accumulation where summary vectors from all previous segments are concatenated, allowing for direct information flow between all segments. 

- Training with randomized segment lengths, making the model robust to documents of varying lengths.

- Demonstrating that the resulting summary vectors capture high-level semantic information and can be used in various applications to improve performance, including long-range language modeling, in-context learning, and retrieval augmentation.

- Showing efficiency benefits of pre-computing and caching summary vectors for large corpora, for example to enable efficient inference in retrieval-based settings.

In summary, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple but effective technique for extending the context window of language models while also speeding up inference, improving the efficiency and versatility of large pretrained models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes adapting pre-trained language models into AutoCompressors that can recursively summarize long documents into compact summary vectors. These summary vectors can extend the context window of LMs and speed up inference, while retaining useful information for tasks like language modeling and in-context learning. The key ideas are to accumulate summaries across segments and train with randomized segmentation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on adapting language models to long contexts:

- The idea of using summary vectors to compress long contexts is novel. Most prior work has focused on architectural modifications to the Transformer to enable long-range modeling, such as limiting the attention window, sparsifying attention, or using recurrence. This paper introduces a simple prompt tuning method to teach existing LMs to compress contexts into summary vectors.

- The proposed training method using randomized segmentation and summary accumulation is intuitive and does not require any architectural changes. This contrasts with other approaches like the Recurrent Memory Transformer which require specialized architectures. The ability to adapt any off-the-shelf LM is advantageous.

- The unsupervised training procedure allows AutoCompressors to be trained on a large amount of unlabeled text without task-specific objectives. This could make the summary vectors useful for many downstream tasks, as explored in the paper. Other long-context modeling techniques are often trained on specific end tasks.

- The computational advantages of using compact summary vectors versus full attention over long contexts are clearly demonstrated. The gains on tasks like retrieval and ranking when using pre-computed summaries are important practical contributions.

- The performance when using summary vectors does not always match full attention over plain text contexts. Closing this gap remains an area for future work, and the limitations around information retention in soft prompts are acknowledged.

Overall, AutoCompressors offer a simple and flexible approach for adapting LMs to long contexts, with clear computational benefits. The unsupervised training paradigm and strong performance on various downstream tasks highlight the promise of this direction. However, there is still room for improvement to reach the capabilities of architectural modifications that enable full attention over very long sequences.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling AutoCompressors to bigger models and improving the quality of summary vectors to further close the gap with full attention over long-range contexts. The paper evaluates AutoCompressors on OPT models up to 2.7B parameters, so applying and evaluating the approach on larger models could be an interesting direction. The authors also note there is still a gap in performance compared to full attention, so improving summary vectors is an area for future work.

- Exploring different pre-trained model families as a starting point for AutoCompressors, since the paper focuses on OPT models. The inductive biases of other model families may make adapting them as AutoCompressors more or less challenging.

- Improving the training signal and optimization process for efficiently learning high-quality summary vectors. The paper notes the training signal may currently be limited by the pre-trained model's ability to make local predictions without the summary vectors. Better optimizing this could lead to better summary vectors.

- Developing more efficient ways to combine a large number of summary vectors, since summary accumulation still scales quadratically. Finding alternatives to concatenation that can combine many summary vectors efficiently could help scale AutoCompressors further.

- Closing the gap between summary vectors and full attention over retrieved documents in the retrieval-augmented language modeling experiments. Finding ways for the summary vectors to better utilize all the information in retrieved documents is noted as an area for future improvement.

- Additional applications and evaluations of AutoCompressors, since the paper focuses on a few specific tasks. Evaluating on a wider range of downstream applications would be helpful for further understanding the strengths and limitations.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes AutoCompressors, which are language models adapted to compress long contexts into compact summary vectors. These summary vectors can then be passed as soft prompts to extend the model's effective context window. The authors introduce a simple unsupervised training strategy where texts are segmented and the model recursively produces summary vectors that are accumulated across segments. Experiments show AutoCompressors can utilize contexts of 30,000+ tokens to improve perplexity, and that summary vectors encode useful semantic information. The authors evaluate summary vectors for in-context learning, finding they can substitute plain-text prompts while reducing inference cost. They also explore using summary vectors in retrieval-augmented language modeling and passage re-ranking. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as an inexpensive method to extend language models to long contexts and speed up inference when summary vectors are pre-computed.

The key ideas are:
1) Adapting LMs to produce summary vectors of text recursively. This is done by introducing special tokens to trigger summary vector output. 
2) Unsupervised training by segmenting texts, producing summary vectors for each segment, and using those to condition the model for future segments via summary accumulation.
3) Evaluations showing summary vectors improve perplexity with 30k+ token contexts, substitute plain-text prompts in ICL, and enable efficient retrieval when pre-computed.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes AutoCompressors, which are language models adapted to compress long text contexts into summary vectors. The key ideas are:

- They take a pre-trained language model and add special summary tokens to the vocabulary. When these tokens are appended to the input, the model outputs corresponding summary vector representations of the preceding context. 

- The models are trained with an unsupervised language modeling objective, where long documents are split into segments. The summary vectors from previous segments are concatenated and used as conditioning context when predicting the next tokens in later segments. This encourages the model to capture useful information in the summary vectors.

- They use summary accumulation where summary vectors from all previous segments are concatenated, allowing information to flow from any previous segment. Randomized segment lengths during training makes the model robust to compressing variable lengths.

- The resulting AutoCompressor models are shown to improve perplexity on long-range language modeling. They also encode useful information for tasks like in-context learning and retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as an efficient method to extend the context length of language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a method for adapting pre-trained language models into "AutoCompressors" that can compress long contexts into compact summary vectors. The summary vectors can then be used as soft prompts to provide the model with useful contextual information from long documents, while reducing the computational cost compared to processing the full plain text. 

The key problems and questions addressed are:

- How to extend the limited context window of transformer models to very long documents in an efficient way. This is addressed by training the models to recursively generate summary vectors over segments of a document.

- How to leverage long contexts to improve language modeling performance. Summary vectors are shown to capture useful information for reducing perplexity over documents much longer than the model's context window.

- How to speed up inference when processing or conditioning on long texts. Summary vectors emerge as useful substitutes for plain text contexts across tasks like in-context learning and retrieval-augmented language modeling.

- How to pre-compute and cache soft prompts on large corpora for efficient retrieval. Storing summary vectors instead of full transformer outputs is shown to be beneficial in two case studies.

Overall, the key innovation is an unsupervised training strategy to teach language models to compress long contexts into short summary vector prompts. This gives a simple but effective method to extend transformers to long documents while speeding up inference.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes training AutoCompressors using an unsupervised objective where long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from previous segments are used for language modeling. How might the quality of the summary vectors change if you were to use a supervised training objective instead? Could the vectors capture more task-specific semantic information?

2. The method of stopping gradients after 2 compression steps is introduced to reduce memory requirements. How might training change if you allowed full backpropagation through the entire document? Would the model learn to compress information more selectively?

3. The paper shows performance improves with randomized segmenting during training. Why might this be the case? Does this prevent the model from overfitting to certain segment lengths or trivial shortcuts during compression? 

4. The choice of using 50 summary vectors is justified by an ablation study. But could using an adaptive number of vectors depending on segment length lead to better compression? How might you train a model to decide on the fly how many vectors are needed?

5. The paper leaves open how to scale AutoCompressors to even longer documents. What are some potential issues that might arise from having hundreds of compression steps? Could new mechanisms like clustering vectors or combining them in a hierarchy help?

6. For retrieval experiments, the paper notes that summary vectors do not retain as much information as raw text. What types of information could get lost or distorted during compression? How might you enhance training to address this?

7. The ICL experiments use a fixed number of examples per segment. Could an adaptive strategy that condenses more examples into fewer vectors when they are similar improve results? How would you implement this?

8. How robust is the compression to changes in domain or style of the text? Does the model pick up any biases or idiosyncrasies of the pretraining data that affect summary quality on new data?

9. The paper suggests AutoCompressors could enable new ways of reasoning over passages by accumulating summary vectors. Can you think of any novel architectures or objectives that could take advantage of this capability?

10. A limitation noted is that combining summary vectors still scales quadratically. Could approximate nearest neighbor search be used to find only the most relevant vectors to attend over? How might this affect what information gets propagated through very long documents?
