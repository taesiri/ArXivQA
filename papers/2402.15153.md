# [Self-Adaptive Reconstruction with Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised   Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15153)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for unsupervised sentence embeddings like SimCSE suffer from two issues: 1) They ignore fine-grained semantics during token aggregation, leading to incorrect similarity judgments, 2) They exhibit token bias towards frequency, where the representations of frequent tokens dominate, degrading performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Reconstruction Contrastive Sentence Embeddings (SARCSE) framework to address these issues. 

- It uses an autoencoder to reconstruct all tokens in the input sentences. This forces the model to preserve fine-grained semantics during aggregation. 

- It also proposes a self-adaptive reconstruction loss based on token frequency to alleviate the token bias issue. The loss assigns lower weights for reconstructing frequent tokens.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes token reconstruction using autoencoders to capture fine-grained semantics in sentence embeddings.

- Introduces a frequency-based self-adaptive loss to mitigate token bias towards frequent tokens.

- Achieves new SOTA results on 7 STS benchmarks, outperforming SimCSE, especially on datasets requiring fine-grained understanding.

- Reduces reliance on large batch sizes for contrastive learning compared to SimCSE.

- Provides detailed analysis on the alignment-uniformity tradeoff and shows the density plots of similarity distributions.

In summary, the key novelty is in using token reconstruction and an adaptive loss to enhance fine-grained semantics and alleviate token bias issues in contrastive sentence embeddings. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SARCSE framework.
