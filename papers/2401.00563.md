# [KernelGPT: Enhanced Kernel Fuzzing via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "KernelGPT: Enhanced Kernel Fuzzing via Large Language Models":

Problem: 
- Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users globally. Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is an effective technique to detect such bugs by automatically generating syscalls (system calls) to trigger crashes. 
- Syzkaller is a popular kernel fuzzer but relies on manually created descriptions of syscalls, called specifications. Crafting specifications requires deep kernel expertise and most syscalls lack specifications, limiting Syzkaller's effectiveness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically generate Syzkaller specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs). 
- The key insight is that LLMs have been exposed to massive amounts of kernel code, docs, and use cases during pre-training. Thus, they can analyze driver code to produce high-quality specifications.

- KernelGPT utilizes an iterative approach to infer all specification components. It first deduces the device name and initialization. Then it determines the command values, argument types, and type definitions by recursively analyzing code that LLMs indicate as required.

- Specifications are validated using Syzkaller's tools. Invalid ones are repaired by querying LLMs with the error messages and related source code.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to utilize LLMs for automated syscall specification generation to enhance kernel fuzzing.

- Implemented prototype KernelGPT using GPT-4 to iteratively analyze driver source code guided by LLMs. 

- Evaluated on 50 previously undescribed drivers. Detected 8 crashes, with 7 being previously unknown. Specifications contribute 6668 additional unique coverage lines.

- Comparison with state-of-the-art tools shows KernelGPT achieving 21.3% higher coverage. Syzkaller team has requested upstreaming specifications inferred by KernelGPT.
