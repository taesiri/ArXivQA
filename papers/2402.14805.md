# [Identifying Multiple Personalities in Large Language Models with   External Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into human applications, raising concerns about their behavior and personalities. 
- Most prior works have tried to quantify LLM personalities using self-assessment tests designed for humans. However, the validity and reliability of applying these tests to LLMs is questionable.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors investigate an alternate "external evaluation" method to measure LLM personalities, where an external machine learning model predicts personalities based on LLM text generations.
- They fine-tune a Llama2 model on a dataset of human text labeled with MBTI personalities. This model significantly outperforms prior MBTI prediction models.

Experiments:
- LLMs are prompted to generate tweets and comments on real-world news events and existing tweets. This avoids exposure to pre-training data. 
- The generations are evaluated by the fine-tuned model to obtain LLM personality distributions. The same is done for human celebrities. 
- LLMs exhibit markedly different personalities when posting tweets vs commenting. But human personalities are consistent across the roles.

Key Contributions:
- Proposal of an external evaluation framework to quantify LLM personalities.
- State-of-the-art MBTI prediction model by fine-tuning Llama2.  
- Empirical demonstration that LLM personalities are not enduring but depend on the role, unlike humans.
- The paper calls for re-evaluating how we define and measure personalities for LLMs based on these observations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates large language model personalities using an external evaluation method based on a fine-tuned model, finds inconsistencies compared to human personalities, and calls for reevaluating personality definition and measurement in LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an "external personality evaluation" method to measure LLM personalities using a fine-tuned Llama2-7B model as a third-party agent for personality detection. This is an alternative to using self-assessment tests which have been shown to be unreliable for evaluating LLM personalities.

2. It shows that LLMs exhibit significantly different personalities when playing different roles (writing tweets vs commenting on tweets), whereas humans show consistent personality distributions across these roles. This highlights a key difference between personalities in humans versus LLMs. 

3. It conducts validation experiments on human counterparts to confirm that the personality detection model produces consistent results for humans. This rules out issues with the evaluation method itself and confirms that the inconsistencies are inherent to personalities exhibited by LLMs.

4. Based on these observations, the paper calls for a re-evaluation of how we define and measure personalities for LLMs, cautioning against a direct transfer of methods used for human personality analysis. It suggests more fundamental work is needed taking into account the specific characteristics of LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is using an alternative evaluation method to show LLMs exhibit "non-enduring" personalities unlike humans, and calling for more appropriate methods to analyze personalities specifically suited for LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Personality measurement/evaluation 
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
- External personality evaluation 
- Self-assessment tests
- Prompting pipelines
- Situational questions
- Enduring characteristic (of personality)
- Inconsistency in LLM personalities
- Re-evaluation of LLM personality definition

The paper investigates personalities exhibited by large language models (LLMs) using an external evaluation method, rather than self-assessment tests. It fine-tunes a model to predict MBTI personality types. By prompting LLMs to respond to situational questions and analyzing the responses, the paper finds LLMs exhibit different personalities in different contexts, unlike the enduring personality characteristic in humans. This suggests a need to re-evaluate personality definition and measurement for LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "external personality evaluation" method to measure LLM personalities instead of using self-assessment tests. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of this method compared to self-assessment tests? How reliable and valid is this external evaluation method for assessing LLM personalities?

2. The paper fine-tunes a Llama2-7B model on a dataset of human tweets and MBTI labels to create a personality prediction model. What considerations went into the choice of model architecture, hyperparameters, and training methodology? How was the performance of this model validated?

3. The paper collects LLM-generated tweets by prompting the models with summarized news events. What was the motivation behind prompting the LLMs with real-world events instead of random or made-up scenarios? How might this impact the generalizability of the personality analysis? 

4. For the human validation experiment, tweets from 8 celebrities were analyzed using the personality prediction model. What criteria were used to select these celebrities? Would analyzing non-celebrity humans impact the results or conclusions?

5. The results show LLMs exhibit different personalities in different contexts, unlike humans. What might explain this fundamental difference? Is it an intrinsic property of LLMs or an artifact of the evaluation methodology?

6. The authors conclude that the definition and measurement of LLM personality should be re-evaluated based on the observed differences from human personality. What specific limitations exist in the current definitions and measurements of LLM personality? What open questions remain regarding appropriately defining and assessing LLM personalities?

7. The study utilizes 4 different LLMs - ChatGPT, Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Llama2-70B. What motivated the choice of these particular models? Would the results generalize to other LLMs not analyzed in this study?

8. The personality prediction model achieves 81.7% accuracy on the 16-class MBTI prediction task. How might errors in the prediction model impact the analysis of LLM personalities? What could be done to further improve accuracy?

9. What are some potential next steps and areas of future work based on the findings and limitations discussed in this paper regarding evaluating LLM personalities?

10. From a broader perspective, why does understanding and appropriately defining LLM personalities matter? What role might insights about LLM personalities play in the responsible development and deployment of LLMs?
