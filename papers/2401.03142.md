# [Explicit Visual Prompts for Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03142)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most deep learning based visual trackers rely on a fixed template or complex template updating strategies. However, fixed templates cannot handle target appearance changes over time. Template updating strategies require carefully designing when and how to update, which is difficult. Therefore, effectively exploiting spatio-temporal information between video frames is crucial for robust visual tracking.

Method - Explicit Visual Prompts Tracking (EVPTrack):
1) Uses tokens to propagate spatio-temporal information between consecutive frames. This avoids focusing on when to update templates.

2) Generates explicit spatio-temporal and multi-scale prompts from the tokens and template. These prompts guide feature extraction and fusion, without needing additional updating modules.

3) Spatio-temporal prompts exploit frame-to-frame context to capture appearance changes. Multi-scale prompts provide fine-grained template features to handle scale changes.

4) SimplePrompt Generator and Spatio-Temporal Encoder modules generate the prompts and propagate tokens. Image-Prompt Encoder fuses prompts and image tokens using a transformer.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel exploitation of spatio-temporal information via prompt learning instead of template updating. Avoids when-to-update dilemma.

2) Effective use of multi-scale features to handle scale changes, through explicit visual prompts.

3) State-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while running in real-time. Eg - 72.7% AUC on LaSOT at 71 FPS.

In summary, EVPTrack proposes a new explicit visual prompts based tracking paradigm to effectively exploit spatio-temporal and multi-scale information for robust visual tracking.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel explicit visual prompts tracking framework (EVPTrack) that effectively utilizes spatio-temporal and multi-scale information to achieve competitive performance at real-time speed for visual tracking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents a novel explicit visual prompts tracking framework (EVPTrack) that effectively utilizes both spatio-temporal and multi-scale information. The explicit visual prompts are made from these two kinds of information.

2. To avoid the "when-and-how-to-update" dilemma associated with template update mechanisms, it introduces a novel propagation mechanism that utilizes tokens to propagate spatio-temporal information between consecutive frames. 

3. The tracker achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks. In particular, it achieved 72.7% success score (AUC) on the LaSOT test set.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a tracking framework that exploits spatio-temporal and multi-scale information effectively via explicit visual prompts, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and avoids issues with traditional template update mechanisms.
