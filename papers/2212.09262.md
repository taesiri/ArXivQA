# [Out-of-domain GAN inversion via Invertibility Decomposition for   Photo-Realistic Human Face Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09262)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we improve the fidelity of GAN inversion for out-of-domain image contents by precisely estimating and utilizing the invertibility of different spatial regions in the image?The key points are:- GAN inversion involves encoding a real image into the latent space of a GAN generator and reconstructing it. However, fidelity is limited for out-of-domain (OOD) image contents beyond the generator's modeling capacity.- The paper proposes to estimate an "invertibility mask" to decompose the input image into invertible and OOD regions. The invertible regions can be reconstructed well through GAN inversion while the OOD regions should be preserved from the original. - The main challenge is precisely estimating the invertibility mask. Previous methods rely on the reconstruction error, but this is imprecise due to errors even in invertible regions. - The proposed method instead aligns the generated image spatially to the input using an optical flow prediction module. This reduces errors in invertible regions, allowing the mask estimation to focus on true OOD areas.- Experiments show the proposed method improves inversion fidelity and editing realism by blending the OOD input content with the inverted result for the invertible regions only.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by estimating invertibility spatially and utilizing it to selectively invert and blend image regions, fidelity can be improved for out-of-domain GAN inversion.
