# [Anarchic Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09875)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question addressed in this paper is how to design effective federated learning algorithms that can handle highly flexible and asynchronous participation of workers. Specifically, the paper proposes a new federated learning paradigm called "Anarchic Federated Learning" (AFL) to allow workers to participate in training freely based on their local situations (e.g. battery level, communication channel conditions, privacy concerns etc.) without any rigid control from the server side. This is in contrast to conventional federated learning frameworks where worker behaviors are tightly dictated by the server.The key research questions explored are:1) Is it possible to develop convergent training algorithms under such chaotic and anarchic worker behaviors in AFL? 2) If yes, under what conditions can convergence be achieved and how fast will the convergence be?3) Can the proposed AFL algorithms still retain the desirable "linear speedup effect" in terms of number of workers and local steps as in conventional federated learning?To address these questions, the paper proposes two anarchic federated averaging (AFA) algorithms tailored for cross-device and cross-silo settings respectively. Theoretical analysis is provided on the convergence guarantees of the proposed AFA algorithms. The results show that under some mild assumptions, the proposed algorithms can achieve convergence rates matching the state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms, while still retaining the linear speedup effect.In summary, the core research contribution is in proposing the anarchic federated learning framework to handle highly flexible worker participation, along with algorithm design and convergence analysis to demonstrate the viability of this paradigm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the main contribution:The paper proposes a new federated learning paradigm called "Anarchic Federated Learning" (AFL). The key idea is to allow workers (edge devices) complete freedom in terms of when and how much to participate in training, without any control from the server. This is in contrast to conventional federated learning where the server dictates worker participation. The main contributions are:- Proposing the anarchic federated learning framework that allows flexible worker participation and asynchronous communication. This better matches practical systems where workers have heterogeneous capabilities/availabilities.- Developing two anarchic federated averaging (AFA) algorithms for cross-device and cross-silo settings. These are asynchronous versions of the popular FedAvg algorithm.- Providing convergence analysis for the proposed AFA algorithms. Interestingly, under certain assumptions like bounded delays, the AFA algorithms match the convergence rates of synchronous federated learning algorithms like FedAvg.- Showing both theoretically and empirically that the AFA algorithms retain the desirable "linear speedup" property in terms of number of workers and local steps.- Demonstrating through experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks that AFA performs comparably to synchronous FedAvg under various anarchic conditions like heterogeneous local steps and arbitrary worker arrivals.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and analyzing a new anarchic federated learning framework that provides greater flexibility for workers while retaining convergence guarantees and system efficiency. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that asynchronous anarchic federated learning can work well.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new federated learning paradigm called "Anarchic Federated Learning" (AFL) where workers can participate asynchronously and choose their own number of local steps, and shows that the proposed Anarchic Federated Averaging (AFA) algorithms can achieve convergence guarantees and linear speedup under this flexible setting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other research in its field:- The paper presents a new federated learning paradigm called "Anarchic Federated Learning" (AFL) that allows for more flexible worker participation compared to conventional federated learning approaches. This is a novel concept not explored much in prior federated learning literature. Most existing work has focused on server-centric approaches with tight server-worker coordination.- The proposed AFL algorithms called Anarchic Federated Averaging (AFA-CD and AFA-CS) are loosely coupled between workers and the server. This allows asynchronous updates and heterogeneous local steps across workers. In contrast, most prior federated learning algorithms rely on synchronous updates and identical local steps. A few recent works have started exploring asynchronous updates, but theoretical analysis is still limited.- The paper provides a theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed AFA algorithms under non-convex settings. The derived convergence rates match or improve upon the best known results for conventional federated learning, while allowing flexible worker participation. This level of theoretical analysis for asynchronous heterogeneous federated learning has not been seen before.- Existing works on flexible worker participation either lack theoretical guarantees, make strong assumptions (e.g. bounded gradients, same local steps), or do not achieve the full linear speedup like AFA. The empirical evaluations in this paper also demonstrate robustness of AFA to asynchrony and heterogeneity.- For cross-silo AFL, AFA-CS cleverly adapts server-side variance reduction techniques to eliminate the non-vanishing error term in convergence. This leads to an improved convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(MKT)) that even holds for partial worker participation, unlike prior arts. In summary, this paper pushes the envelope in asynchronous heterogeneous federated learning, backed by strong theoretical analysis. The proposed AFL paradigm and AFA algorithms provide a new direction for flexible and robust federated learning suitable for edge networks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more sample-efficient meta-learning algorithms. The authors note that current meta-learning algorithms require a large number of tasks for meta-training. Reducing this sample complexity would allow meta-learning to be applied more broadly.- Exploring meta-learning for continual/lifelong learning settings. The authors suggest adapting meta-learning techniques like MAML and Reptile for continually learning new tasks over time from a data stream. This could allow agents to efficiently build on prior knowledge.- Combining meta-learning with modular architectures. The authors propose combining meta-learning objectives with modular/compositional network architectures. This could enable rapid learning of new behaviors by reusing and composing previously learned modules.- Meta-learning representations and inductive biases. Rather than just meta-learning optimization procedures, the authors suggest directly learning representations and inductive biases that are broadly useful for fast adaptation to new tasks.- Developing theoretical understandings of meta-learning. There is still limited theoretical characterization of why and when meta-learning methods are effective. Further theoretical analysis could provide insights for designing improved algorithms.- Exploring connections to cognitive science and neuroscience. The authors suggest building bridges between meta-learning research and theories of learning in humans and animals. This could provide mutual benefits across fields.- Applications of meta-learning in fields like robotics, medicine, education. The authors encourage exploring real-world applications of meta-learning to important problems beyond standard ML benchmarks.In summary, the main directions are developing more efficient and general meta-learning methods, combining meta-learning with other techniques like modular networks, establishing stronger theory and connections to related fields, and translating methods to impactful applications.
