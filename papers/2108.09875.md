# [Anarchic Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09875)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question addressed in this paper is how to design effective federated learning algorithms that can handle highly flexible and asynchronous participation of workers. Specifically, the paper proposes a new federated learning paradigm called "Anarchic Federated Learning" (AFL) to allow workers to participate in training freely based on their local situations (e.g. battery level, communication channel conditions, privacy concerns etc.) without any rigid control from the server side. This is in contrast to conventional federated learning frameworks where worker behaviors are tightly dictated by the server.The key research questions explored are:1) Is it possible to develop convergent training algorithms under such chaotic and anarchic worker behaviors in AFL? 2) If yes, under what conditions can convergence be achieved and how fast will the convergence be?3) Can the proposed AFL algorithms still retain the desirable "linear speedup effect" in terms of number of workers and local steps as in conventional federated learning?To address these questions, the paper proposes two anarchic federated averaging (AFA) algorithms tailored for cross-device and cross-silo settings respectively. Theoretical analysis is provided on the convergence guarantees of the proposed AFA algorithms. The results show that under some mild assumptions, the proposed algorithms can achieve convergence rates matching the state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms, while still retaining the linear speedup effect.In summary, the core research contribution is in proposing the anarchic federated learning framework to handle highly flexible worker participation, along with algorithm design and convergence analysis to demonstrate the viability of this paradigm.
