# [OST: Refining Text Knowledge with Optimal Spatio-Temporal Descriptor for   General Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current methods for adapting image-text models (e.g. CLIP) to video rely on adding temporal modeling components but do not address the semantic discrepancy between the descriptive narratives seen during image-text pretraining and the more concise category names used to label video datasets. This results in a less separable latent space that can hinder video recognition performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a new method called Optimal Spatio-Temporal Descriptor (OST) that has two main components:

1) Spatio-Temporal Descriptors: Prompt a large language model to generate detailed textual descriptors that disentangle a category name into a spatial descriptor capturing static visual elements, and a temporal descriptor detailing the step-by-step evolution of the action over time. This enhances the semantic distinction compared to just using the category names.

2) Optimal Descriptor Solver: Formulate the video recognition problem as an optimal transport problem to obtain the best matching between frame-level visual features and the descriptor embeddings on a per-video basis. This addresses variability in relevance of descriptors across videos of the same class.

Main Contributions:
- Provide new insight on semantic discrepancy limiting performance when adapting image-text models to video
- Propose Spatio-Temporal descriptors to enhance semantic distinction and provide external knowledge 
- Introduce Optimal Descriptor Solver to adaptively assign optimal descriptors to each video via optimal transport
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets for zero-shot, few-shot and fully supervised video recognition

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing video recognition by prioritizing refinement of the textual representations via descriptive narratives tailored on a per-video basis, rather than solely addressing visual discrepancies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel approach for general video recognition by first disentangling action category names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors using language models to enhance the semantic distinction, and then introducing an Optimal Descriptor Solver to adaptively align the optimal descriptors with video frames for improved recognition performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Providing new insights that prior pipelines for adapting vision-language pre-trained models to video recognition are constrained by the semantic space of category names. 

2. Proposing "Spatio-Temporal Descriptors" derived from large language models (LLMs) to enhance the distinction of semantic space and provide external knowledge for general recognition.

3. Introducing "Optimal Descriptor Solver" that forms the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors to fully refine the semantic knowledge. 

4. Presenting a new way to utilize external knowledge from LLMs to adapt pre-trained visual-language models for general video recognition. Experimental results in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability.

So in summary, the main contribution is refining the text knowledge from LLMs to facilitate the adaptation of pre-trained vision-language models for enhanced general video recognition, which is validated through comprehensive experiments.
