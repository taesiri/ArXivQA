# [Order-Disorder: Imitation Adversarial Attacks for Black-box Neural   Ranking Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06506)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how to conduct adversarial attacks against black-box neural text ranking models? 

Specifically, the authors propose a novel imitation adversarial attack method against black-box neural ranking models. The key ideas include:

1) Training a ranking imitation model to transparentize the target black-box ranking model, by sampling ranking results and training a pairwise BERT model.

2) Proposing a Pairwise Anchor-based Trigger (PAT) generation method that utilizes the ranking imitation model's pairwise loss and ranking information to craft adversarial triggers. 

3) Employing fluency and semantic consistency constraints during trigger generation to equip the triggers with camouflage. 

4) Demonstrating the attack effectiveness and transferability of the triggers from the imitation model to the target victim models.

The main hypothesis is that by training a similar ranking imitation model and generating camouflaged triggers based on it, the attack can transfer to black-box neural ranking models effectively. The experiments on passage ranking datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed attack method.

In summary, the paper focuses on investigating a novel imitation-based adversarial attack against black-box text ranking models, which remains underexplored in prior studies. The proposed attack method and extensive evaluations reveal vulnerabilities of neural ranking models.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an imitation adversarial attack method against black-box neural ranking models. The authors first train a ranking imitation model using relative ranking information sampled from the victim model's outputs. This imitation model is able to mimic the victim model's rankings. Using this imitation model, the authors propose a novel Pairwise Anchor-based Trigger (PAT) generation method to create adversarial triggers for each candidate passage. These triggers can manipulate the ranking results when transferred to the victim model. The PAT method introduces a pairwise loss function using an anchor passage to optimize the triggers. It also uses language model fluency and next sentence prediction constraints to improve the triggers. Experiments on passage ranking datasets demonstrate that the proposed attack method can successfully manipulate rankings on various state-of-the-art neural ranking models in a black-box setting. The imitation model achieves high ranking similarity with the victim models, showing the efficacy of the proposed approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new imitation adversarial attack method against black-box neural ranking models. The attack has two main steps. First, the attacker trains a ranking imitation model by querying the target model to get ranking lists for sample queries. The imitation model learns to mimic the target's rankings using a pairwise learning approach, without needing true relevance labels. Second, the attacker generates adversarial triggers for the imitation model using a novel pairwise anchor-based method. The triggers aim to boost ranks of chosen passages by optimizing a pairwise ranking loss. The attack transfers to the target model due to the imitation model's similarity. Experiments on passage ranking datasets show the attack can significantly boost ranks of irrelevant passages in the target model. The paper also analyzes different mitigation approaches.

The key contributions are: (1) A new black-box imitation attack method that transfers adversarial triggers from an imitation model to a target model. (2) A pairwise anchor-based trigger generation method using ranking triplets. (3) Extensive experiments showing the attack effectiveness against neural passage rankers like BERT and MiniLM. The attack could motivate developing more robust ranking models. Overall, the paper presents a novel imitation adversarial attack for black-box text ranking models. By transparentizing and imitating the target model, an attacker can generate adversarial triggers that transfer and manipulate rankings. The proposed pairwise anchor-based trigger optimization is shown to be an effective attack method.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is an imitation adversarial attack against black-box neural ranking models. The key steps are:

1. Train a ranking imitation model called Pairwise BERT to mimic the victim black-box ranking model. The imitation model is trained on triples of (query, relative positive passage, relative negative passage) sampled from the victim model's ranking results. This allows it to imitate the victim model without needing access to its architecture, parameters, or training data.

2. Generate adversarial triggers for the imitation model using a proposed method called Pairwise Anchor-based Trigger (PAT) generation. This uses the pairwise loss and ranking information from the imitation model to craft triggers that can manipulate the ranking. The triggers are optimized to maximize the ranking score difference between the target passage (with trigger) and anchor passages. Fluency and semantic consistency constraints are added to make the triggers stealthy. 

3. Transfer the adversarial triggers from the imitation model to the victim black-box model. Due to the similarity between the two models, the triggers are able to manipulate the victim model's rankings as well.

So in summary, the core novelty is using ranking imitation to enable black-box adversarial attacks via transferable triggers, together with a tailored trigger generation method that leverages ranking structure. Experiments show this can manipulate rankings of neural models like BERT and MiniLM.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of adversarial attacks against neural text ranking models. Specifically, it focuses on black-box attacks where the adversary has no knowledge of the target model architecture, training data, or score function. The main questions addressed are:

1) How to transparentize and imitate a black-box neural text ranking model in order to generate effective adversarial attacks against it. The paper proposes using a ranking imitation model trained on triplets sampled from the target model's ranking lists.

2) How to generate adversarial triggers that can manipulate the ranking results and transfer to the black-box target model. The paper proposes a pairwise anchor-based trigger (PAT) generation method that uses the ranking imitation model's pairwise loss and anchor passages to craft triggers. 

3) How effective are the proposed imitation attack and PAT trigger generation method against state-of-the-art neural ranking models like BERT and MiniLM. Experiments on passage ranking datasets demonstrate they can successfully manipulate rankings.

4) How to make the triggers stealthy and resilient to potential defenses. Constraints like fluency and next sentence prediction are added to the PAT objective to improve imperceptibility. Analyses show the triggers evade perplexity-based and grammar-based filters.

So in summary, the key focus is on developing and evaluating black-box adversarial attacks for neural text ranking using a model imitation and tailored trigger generation approach. This is an important problem affecting ranking robustness and reliability that had been under-explored in prior work.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial attack method against neural ranking models by training a ranking imitation model to transparentize the target model. The ranking imitation model is trained on triplets sampled from the target model's rankings to mimic its behavior, without needing access to the target model's architecture or training data.
