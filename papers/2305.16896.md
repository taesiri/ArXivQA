# [MultiTool-CoT: GPT-3 Can Use Multiple External Tools with Chain of
  Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16896)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to use multiple external tools, such as a calculator and knowledge retriever, to improve performance on reasoning tasks. 

The central hypothesis is that allowing LLMs to leverage multiple external tools during the reasoning process will significantly improve their performance on tasks requiring both numerical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, compared to using LLMs alone or with just one external tool.

In particular, the paper tests this hypothesis by applying MultiTool-CoT to the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE, which requires both numerical reasoning and chemistry knowledge. The central research question is whether MultiTool-CoT will outperform strong baselines on this task.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using multiple external tools together with LLMs via MultiTool-CoT will improve reasoning performance, and the research question is whether this holds true specifically on the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the MultiTool-CoT framework.

- The proposed framework and techniques are general and could likely be applied to other reasoning tasks by modifying the external tools used. The paper provides a strong proof-of-concept on a complex reasoning task.

- One limitation is that the effectiveness is shown on only one dataset. Testing on additional diverse tasks could further validate the benefits of the MultiTool-CoT approach.

In summary, this paper presents a novel and general framework for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by combining multiple tools. It shows clear improvements over prior approaches and state-of-the-art results on a complex numerical reasoning dataset. Testing the framework on more tasks in future work would be beneficial.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Validating the effectiveness of the proposed method on more realistic tasks that require multiple external tools. The authors note that most existing reasoning benchmarks can be solved with just one external tool, but real-world applications often require multiple tools. Therefore, it is important to test the approach on more complex tasks.

- Applying the framework to other reasoning tasks beyond the chemistry domain. The proposed method is general and could be useful for different tasks by changing/adding new external tools. The authors plan to verify its effectiveness on other tasks.

- Building new benchmark datasets that require using multiple tools, to further facilitate research in this area. The lack of such benchmarks currently limits analysis of methods like the one proposed.

- Investigating ways to make the method more robust to incorrect/invalid tool inputs generated by the LLM. A significant portion of the errors were due to the LLM generating bad inputs for the tools. Improving this could further boost performance.

- Exploring alternate prompting approaches beyond chain-of-thought. Other prompting techniques may potentially work as well or better for incorporating tools.

- Analyzing the learned prompting behavior to better understand how and why the LLM invokes the different tools. This could provide insight into how to improve the approach.

In summary, the key future directions focus on validating the approach on more complex real-world tasks, testing it on more reasoning domains, creating better benchmarks, and analyzing the learned prompting behavior. Robustness to incorrect tool inputs also needs more investigation.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes MultiTool-CoT, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to leverage multiple external tools, such as a calculator and knowledge retriever, during reasoning. The key idea is to use chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to teach the LLM to generate reasoning processes with appropriate triggers to invoke the external tools. As a proof of concept, the authors apply MultiTool-CoT to a numerical reasoning task from NumGLUE that requires both arithmetic calculations and chemistry knowledge. Three tools are implemented - a calculator, a chemical reaction predictor, and a molar mass list. Experiments show that MultiTool-CoT significantly outperforms baselines, including CoT prompting alone and CoT with only one tool. Analysis reveals the combination of tools addresses different types of reasoning errors.

In summary, this paper makes two key contributions. First, it proposes a novel framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows LLMs to leverage multiple external tools during reasoning. This is achieved via CoT prompting and tool triggers. Second, it demonstrates the effectiveness of MultiTool-CoT on a numerical reasoning task requiring both calculation and domain knowledge. Using multiple tools together boosts performance beyond any single tool. The proposed framework is generalizable to other reasoning tasks by modifying the external tools.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes MultiTool-CoT, a framework that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to use multiple external tools during reasoning. It is based on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, where the LLM is prompted with an instruction, few-shot examples showing reasoning processes with tool triggers, and a question to solve. The reasoning process generated by the LLM can contain tool triggers, which are marked strings like "$<<$ToolName$>>$" that indicate when to call an external tool. When a tool trigger is generated, the tool name and input are extracted, the tool is executed, and its output is inserted back into the reasoning process. In this way, the LLM can leverage multiple tools like a calculator, chemical reaction predictor, and molar mass list at appropriate steps during reasoning. The method is applied to a numerical reasoning task requiring chemical knowledge from the NumGLUE benchmark. Experiments show it significantly outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
