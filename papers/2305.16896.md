# MultiTool-CoT: GPT-3 Can Use Multiple External Tools with Chain of   Thought Prompting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to use multiple external tools, such as a calculator and knowledge retriever, to improve performance on reasoning tasks. The central hypothesis is that allowing LLMs to leverage multiple external tools during the reasoning process will significantly improve their performance on tasks requiring both numerical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, compared to using LLMs alone or with just one external tool.In particular, the paper tests this hypothesis by applying MultiTool-CoT to the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE, which requires both numerical reasoning and chemistry knowledge. The central research question is whether MultiTool-CoT will outperform strong baselines on this task.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using multiple external tools together with LLMs via MultiTool-CoT will improve reasoning performance, and the research question is whether this holds true specifically on the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the MultiTool-CoT framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing MultiTool-CoT, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to leverage multiple external tools during reasoning by generating reasoning processes with tool triggers. Specifically:- The paper proposes an interactive framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows LLMs to use multiple external tools like a calculator, knowledge retriever, etc. during reasoning. This addresses limitations of LLMs in relying solely on their parameters and training data. - MultiTool-CoT leverages chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting based on few-shot learning to let LLMs learn to invoke multiple tools at proper reasoning steps.- As a proof of concept, MultiTool-CoT is applied to a numerical reasoning task requiring both arithmetic and chemistry knowledge in the NumGLUE dataset. Experiments show it significantly outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.- The proposed framework is generalizable and can be applied to various tasks by changing/adding tools.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating MultiTool-CoT, a novel few-shot learning framework that enables LLMs to use multiple external tools to compensate for their limitations during reasoning and problem solving.
