# MultiTool-CoT: GPT-3 Can Use Multiple External Tools with Chain of   Thought Prompting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to use multiple external tools, such as a calculator and knowledge retriever, to improve performance on reasoning tasks. The central hypothesis is that allowing LLMs to leverage multiple external tools during the reasoning process will significantly improve their performance on tasks requiring both numerical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, compared to using LLMs alone or with just one external tool.In particular, the paper tests this hypothesis by applying MultiTool-CoT to the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE, which requires both numerical reasoning and chemistry knowledge. The central research question is whether MultiTool-CoT will outperform strong baselines on this task.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using multiple external tools together with LLMs via MultiTool-CoT will improve reasoning performance, and the research question is whether this holds true specifically on the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the MultiTool-CoT framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing MultiTool-CoT, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to leverage multiple external tools during reasoning by generating reasoning processes with tool triggers. Specifically:- The paper proposes an interactive framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows LLMs to use multiple external tools like a calculator, knowledge retriever, etc. during reasoning. This addresses limitations of LLMs in relying solely on their parameters and training data. - MultiTool-CoT leverages chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting based on few-shot learning to let LLMs learn to invoke multiple tools at proper reasoning steps.- As a proof of concept, MultiTool-CoT is applied to a numerical reasoning task requiring both arithmetic and chemistry knowledge in the NumGLUE dataset. Experiments show it significantly outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.- The proposed framework is generalizable and can be applied to various tasks by changing/adding tools.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating MultiTool-CoT, a novel few-shot learning framework that enables LLMs to use multiple external tools to compensate for their limitations during reasoning and problem solving.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes MultiTool-CoT, a novel framework that leverages chain-of-thought prompting to allow large language models like GPT-3 to incorporate multiple external tools such as a calculator and knowledge retriever during reasoning, and shows its effectiveness on a numerical reasoning task requiring both arithmetic and chemistry knowledge.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper proposes a novel framework called MultiTool-CoT that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to leverage multiple external tools during reasoning and problem solving. Previous related work has focused mainly on incorporating a single external tool.- The proposed framework is based on chain-of-thought prompting and requires no fine-tuning of the LLM. Other related works like Dentaku and WebGPT rely on fine-tuning the LLM to generate special tokens or action codes to invoke external tools.- The paper demonstrates the application of MultiTool-CoT on a numerical reasoning task from the NumGLUE benchmark that requires both arithmetic calculations and chemistry knowledge. This is a more complex task than what previous works have tackled.- Experiments show MultiTool-CoT significantly outperforms baselines like zero-shot, few-shot, and single tool versions. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the NumGLUE task, demonstrating the advantage of incorporating multiple tools.- The proposed framework and techniques are general and could likely be applied to other reasoning tasks by modifying the external tools used. The paper provides a strong proof-of-concept on a complex reasoning task.- One limitation is that the effectiveness is shown on only one dataset. Testing on additional diverse tasks could further validate the benefits of the MultiTool-CoT approach.In summary, this paper presents a novel and general framework for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by combining multiple tools. It shows clear improvements over prior approaches and state-of-the-art results on a complex numerical reasoning dataset. Testing the framework on more tasks in future work would be beneficial.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Validating the effectiveness of the proposed method on more realistic tasks that require multiple external tools. The authors note that most existing reasoning benchmarks can be solved with just one external tool, but real-world applications often require multiple tools. Therefore, it is important to test the approach on more complex tasks.- Applying the framework to other reasoning tasks beyond the chemistry domain. The proposed method is general and could be useful for different tasks by changing/adding new external tools. The authors plan to verify its effectiveness on other tasks.- Building new benchmark datasets that require using multiple tools, to further facilitate research in this area. The lack of such benchmarks currently limits analysis of methods like the one proposed.- Investigating ways to make the method more robust to incorrect/invalid tool inputs generated by the LLM. A significant portion of the errors were due to the LLM generating bad inputs for the tools. Improving this could further boost performance.- Exploring alternate prompting approaches beyond chain-of-thought. Other prompting techniques may potentially work as well or better for incorporating tools.- Analyzing the learned prompting behavior to better understand how and why the LLM invokes the different tools. This could provide insight into how to improve the approach.In summary, the key future directions focus on validating the approach on more complex real-world tasks, testing it on more reasoning domains, creating better benchmarks, and analyzing the learned prompting behavior. Robustness to incorrect tool inputs also needs more investigation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes MultiTool-CoT, a novel framework that leverages chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to allow large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to use multiple external tools, such as a calculator and a knowledge retriever, during reasoning. The authors apply MultiTool-CoT to the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE, which requires numerical reasoning and chemistry knowledge. In MultiTool-CoT, LLMs solve reasoning problems by generating reasoning processes with triggers to invoke external tools at proper steps. The external tools implemented include a calculator, a chemical reaction predictor, and a molar mass list. Experiments show MultiTool-CoT significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on NumGLUE Task 2. The majority of remaining errors are caused by incorrect reasoning processes and invalid tool inputs generated by the LLM. The proposed framework is generalizable to other tasks by changing and extending the external tools.
