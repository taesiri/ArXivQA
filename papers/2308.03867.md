# [From Sky to the Ground: A Large-scale Benchmark and Simple Baseline   Towards Real Rain Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How to construct a large-scale, high-quality paired dataset of real rainy images to advance research in real image deraining?The key points are:- Existing deraining datasets have limitations like insufficient diversity of rain types, low image resolutions, and inadequate ground truth image quality. This hampers progress in real image deraining.- The authors propose a new benchmark called LHP-Rain that contains 3000 video sequences with 1 million high-resolution frame pairs exhibiting diverse real rain patterns.- They also propose a robust low-rank tensor recovery method to generate higher quality "clean" ground truth images by separating rain from static backgrounds. - The new benchmark and ground truth generation method aim to provide the research community with a large-scale, high-quality resource to drive further advances in real image deraining performance.In summary, the main research contribution is the creation of an improved dataset to enable better training and evaluation for real image deraining tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It constructs a large-scale and high-quality paired real rain dataset called LHP-Rain. This dataset has 3000 video sequences with around 1 million 1920x1080 resolution frames. It captures diverse real rain types including streaks, veiling, occlusion and ground splashing. 2. It proposes a robust low-rank tensor recovery model (RLRTR) to generate high quality ground truth images for the dataset by separating rain from static backgrounds in videos.3. It designs a simple yet effective baseline deraining model called SCD-Former, which utilizes both self-attention and cross-layer attention between rain and image features for better representation.4. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed LHP-Rain dataset and SCD-Former model over previous datasets and state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. The model trained on LHP-Rain generalizes better to real rainy images.In summary, the main contribution is the large-scale high-quality real rain dataset LHP-Rain and the baseline SCD-Former model, which helps advance research on real image deraining. The proposed RLRTR also helps generate better ground truths for the dataset.
