# [From Sky to the Ground: A Large-scale Benchmark and Simple Baseline   Towards Real Rain Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How to construct a large-scale, high-quality paired dataset of real rainy images to advance research in real image deraining?The key points are:- Existing deraining datasets have limitations like insufficient diversity of rain types, low image resolutions, and inadequate ground truth image quality. This hampers progress in real image deraining.- The authors propose a new benchmark called LHP-Rain that contains 3000 video sequences with 1 million high-resolution frame pairs exhibiting diverse real rain patterns.- They also propose a robust low-rank tensor recovery method to generate higher quality "clean" ground truth images by separating rain from static backgrounds. - The new benchmark and ground truth generation method aim to provide the research community with a large-scale, high-quality resource to drive further advances in real image deraining performance.In summary, the main research contribution is the creation of an improved dataset to enable better training and evaluation for real image deraining tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It constructs a large-scale and high-quality paired real rain dataset called LHP-Rain. This dataset has 3000 video sequences with around 1 million 1920x1080 resolution frames. It captures diverse real rain types including streaks, veiling, occlusion and ground splashing. 2. It proposes a robust low-rank tensor recovery model (RLRTR) to generate high quality ground truth images for the dataset by separating rain from static backgrounds in videos.3. It designs a simple yet effective baseline deraining model called SCD-Former, which utilizes both self-attention and cross-layer attention between rain and image features for better representation.4. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed LHP-Rain dataset and SCD-Former model over previous datasets and state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. The model trained on LHP-Rain generalizes better to real rainy images.In summary, the main contribution is the large-scale high-quality real rain dataset LHP-Rain and the baseline SCD-Former model, which helps advance research on real image deraining. The proposed RLRTR also helps generate better ground truths for the dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new large-scale high-quality paired real rain image dataset containing diverse rain types, proposes a robust low-rank tensor recovery method to generate clean ground truth images, and presents a simple yet effective transformer-based image deraining model as a strong baseline.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of single image deraining:- This paper presents a new large-scale and high-quality paired real rain dataset called LHP-Rain. It contains 3000 video sequences with over 1 million high-resolution frame pairs, making it significantly larger than previous real rain datasets like SPA-data, RainDS, and GT-Rain. The diversity and realism of the rain patterns in LHP-Rain is also greater.- A key contribution is that LHP-Rain contains ground splashing rain, which has been overlooked in previous deraining datasets and research. The authors argue convincingly that handling this type of rain phenomenon is important for real-world applications.- The paper proposes a novel robust low-rank tensor recovery method (RLRTR) for generating high-quality ground truth pairs from video. This appears to be an improvement over simpler filtering methods used in prior datasets. Analyses show RLRTR better separates rain from background.- A new transformer-based deraining baseline method called SCD-Former is presented. It utilizes self-attention and cross-layer attention between the rain and image layers for representation. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on LHP-Rain and other datasets.- Overall, by providing a more diverse and realistic dataset that includes the novel challenge of ground splashing rain, conducting careful analyses of the data, and introducing an effective new deraining method, this paper makes important contributions to advancing the field of single image deraining research. The new dataset and transformer-based approach appear to push the field forward significantly.In summary, the paper introduces impactful new data resources, analyses, and techniques that represent useful progress over prior single image deraining research. The large-scale LHP-Rain dataset and transformer-based SCD-Former method are significant new additions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Develop more advanced video deraining methods to better handle static haze/fog in heavy rain scenes. The authors point out a limitation of their proposed robust low-rank tensor recovery model (RLRTR) in that it cannot effectively decompose haze/fog from the image layer. Developing methods to remove static haze/fog in heavy rain videos could further improve video deraining performance.- Expand the diversity and scale of the proposed LHP-Rain dataset. While LHP-Rain is currently the largest and most diverse real rain dataset, the authors suggest expanding it with more rain types, scenes, and frames to cover an even broader distribution of real-world rains.- Improve generalization of deraining models to unseen rain types. The authors note remaining challenges in generalizing to new types of rain not seen during training. Developing deraining models that can better generalize could help address the domain gap between synthetic and real rains.- Apply deraining to additional high-level vision tasks. The authors demonstrate benefits of deraining for object detection and segmentation. Additional suggested future work is assessing deraining benefits for other vision tasks like depth estimation, visual SLAM, etc.- Develop unsupervised/weakly-supervised deraining methods. The authors note most existing deraining methods are fully supervised. Exploring unsupervised or weakly-supervised techniques could reduce reliance on paired training data.- Apply deraining to video streams. The current work focuses on deraining individual images. Extending deraining algorithms to directly process video streams could be useful for practical applications.In summary, the main future directions are improving video deraining, expanding datasets, enhancing generalization, applying deraining to more vision tasks, reducing supervision, and extending to video streams. Advancing research in these areas could help enable practical deraining systems.
