# [HODN: Disentangling Human-Object Feature for HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10158)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Human and Object Disentangling Network (HODN) for human-object interaction (HOI) detection in images. The key insight is that human features contribute more to predicting interactions, while interaction information helps human detection but disturbs object detection. To model these relationships, HODN contains two parallel decoders to extract disentangled human and object features, and an interaction decoder that focuses on human-centric regions to predict interactions. Specifically, human features are fed as positional embeddings into the interaction decoder via a Human-Guide Linking method to make human features dominant over object features. Furthermore, a Stop-Gradient Mechanism is introduced during training to stop interaction gradients from propagating into the object decoder, thereby preventing negative impacts on object detection while still allowing interactions to aid human detection. Experiments on V-COCO and HICO-Det datasets demonstrate that explicitly modeling these HOI relationships leads to significant performance improvements. Moreover, HODN can be easily combined with existing HOI detection methods to achieve new state-of-the-art results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Human and Object Disentangling Network (HODN) to explicitly model the different relationships between humans, objects, and interactions for human-object interaction detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It analyzes the relationships among humans, objects, and interactions in human-object interaction (HOI) detection:
- Human features contribute more to interaction prediction than object features. 
- Interactive information helps human detection but disturbs object detection.

2) It proposes a Human and Object Disentangling Network (HODN) to explicitly model the above relationships:
- Uses two parallel decoders to extract disentangled human and object features.  
- Introduces a Human-Guide Linking method to make the interaction decoder focus on human-centric regions and give priority to human features over object features.
- Proposes a Stop-Gradient Mechanism to stop interaction gradients from optimizing object detection but allow them to optimize human detection.

3) The proposed method achieves competitive performance on V-COCO and HICO-Det datasets. It is orthogonal to existing methods and can be easily combined with them to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

In summary, the key contribution is explicitly modeling the different relationships among humans, objects, and interactions in HOI detection through network disentanglement and special training strategies.
