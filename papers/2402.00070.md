# [EvoMerge: Neuroevolution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00070)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called EvoMerge for training large language models, inspired by neuroevolution techniques like NEAT. The key idea is to create an evolutionary process for model training, involving iterations of evaluation, selection, crossover/recombination, and mutation. 

The problem driving this work is that extensive fine-tuning of large language models does not always yield better performance, and models can end up overfitting or losing intelligence. The paper hypothesizes that an evolutionary approach could push models beyond the limits of regular fine-tuning.

The proposed EvoMerge method works as follows:

Initialization: Create an initial population of model variants with different hyperparameters, datasets, etc. Higher quality initial models may speed up the process. 

Evaluation: Assess the fitness of each model variant using a methodology designed to measure general intelligence, not just performance on a narrow metric. This is crucial but challenging.

Selection: Based on fitness, select model pairings/groupings to reproduce and form the next generation. Add some randomness and keep top performers to maintain diversity.  

Crossover: Combine weights of selected models using techniques like SLERP or DARE merging. Could explore crossing over hyperparameters.

Mutation: Fine-tune reproduced models using methods like DPO to introduce variance. 

The cycle then repeats, propagating beneficial traits and filtering out poor variants over generations.

The paper shares small prototype experiments, merging models like NeuralBeagle and Turdus. After 5 generations, a model outperformed both parents on an evaluation suite. More experiments are needed to further test the EvoMerge concept.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a neuroevolution-inspired approach to large language model training that could overcome limits of standalone fine-tuning through an iterative process of evaluation, selection, recombination and mutation. Early prototypes show some promise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes EvoMerge, a neuroevolution-based system for training and iteratively merging large language models to push them beyond the limits of conventional fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new method called "EvoMerge" for training and improving large language models. Specifically:

- EvoMerge applies concepts from neuroevolution (e.g. NEAT algorithm) to large language model training, using model merging for "crossover" and fine-tuning for "mutation".

- It establishes an evolutionary process aimed at pushing language models beyond the limits of conventional fine-tuning through successive generations of selection, crossover, and mutation. 

- The paper outlines the key steps in this evolutionary process and provides some small-scale prototype experiments as a proof of concept, showing some promising incremental improvements over existing models.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing and outlining the EvoMerge concept and evolutionary training process for improving large language models. The preliminary experimental results provide an initial demonstration of the potential for further gains using this method.
