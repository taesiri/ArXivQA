## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research contributions of this paper are:- It presents DAG-Rider, the first asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (BAB) protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. - The protocol is post-quantum safe for safety as it does not rely on signatures or asymmetric cryptography. It uses a hybrid approach with information theoretic guarantees for safety and relies on cryptography only for liveness.- It provides eventual fairness, guaranteeing that all values proposed by correct processes are eventually delivered. This is in contrast to some previous protocols that may ignore some proposals. - It is elegantly designed in two modular layers - a communication layer to build a DAG structure representing the communication, and an ordering layer that totally orders proposals by interpreting the DAG locally with no extra communication.- It is the first asynchronous BAB protocol that combines optimal complexity along multiple dimensions with post-quantum safety and eventual fairness. This is enabled by the innovative DAG-based design.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a DAG-based approach can enable an asynchronous BAB protocol to achieve multiple desirable properties simultaneously, which was not possible with prior approaches. The paper makes contributions through the design, analysis and evaluation of the DAG-Rider protocol to validate this hypothesis.
