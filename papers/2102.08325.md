## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research contributions of this paper are:- It presents DAG-Rider, the first asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (BAB) protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. - The protocol is post-quantum safe for safety as it does not rely on signatures or asymmetric cryptography. It uses a hybrid approach with information theoretic guarantees for safety and relies on cryptography only for liveness.- It provides eventual fairness, guaranteeing that all values proposed by correct processes are eventually delivered. This is in contrast to some previous protocols that may ignore some proposals. - It is elegantly designed in two modular layers - a communication layer to build a DAG structure representing the communication, and an ordering layer that totally orders proposals by interpreting the DAG locally with no extra communication.- It is the first asynchronous BAB protocol that combines optimal complexity along multiple dimensions with post-quantum safety and eventual fairness. This is enabled by the innovative DAG-based design.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a DAG-based approach can enable an asynchronous BAB protocol to achieve multiple desirable properties simultaneously, which was not possible with prior approaches. The paper makes contributions through the design, analysis and evaluation of the DAG-Rider protocol to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here is a summary of the main contributions of the paper:- The paper presents DAG-Rider, the first asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (BAB) protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. - BAB is important for building practical Byzantine fault tolerant systems. Previous protocols like VABA and Dumbo achieved some of these optimality properties but not all.- DAG-Rider constructs the BAB protocol in two layers - a communication layer that builds a DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure, and a zero-overhead ordering layer that uses the DAG to order messages with no extra communication.- The propose operation in DAG-Rider is just a single reliable broadcast. The DAG ensures agreement and the validity property of reliable broadcast guarantees all values from correct processes are eventually included.- To order messages, each process assigns them to "waves" in the DAG and tries to commit a single randomly chosen leader for each wave. Once the leaders are chosen, their causal histories in the DAG are delivered. - For safety, DAG-Rider only relies on cryptographic assumptions for liveness. Using a threshold coin, its safety properties are post-quantum secure.- With the right reliable broadcast instantiation, DAG-Rider achieves optimal O(n) amortized communication complexity and O(1) expected time complexity to order n values.In summary, the main contribution is an elegant asynchronous BAB protocol that matches several theoretical optimally bounds and provides post-quantum safety.
