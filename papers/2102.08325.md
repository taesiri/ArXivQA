## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research contributions of this paper are:- It presents DAG-Rider, the first asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (BAB) protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. - The protocol is post-quantum safe for safety as it does not rely on signatures or asymmetric cryptography. It uses a hybrid approach with information theoretic guarantees for safety and relies on cryptography only for liveness.- It provides eventual fairness, guaranteeing that all values proposed by correct processes are eventually delivered. This is in contrast to some previous protocols that may ignore some proposals. - It is elegantly designed in two modular layers - a communication layer to build a DAG structure representing the communication, and an ordering layer that totally orders proposals by interpreting the DAG locally with no extra communication.- It is the first asynchronous BAB protocol that combines optimal complexity along multiple dimensions with post-quantum safety and eventual fairness. This is enabled by the innovative DAG-based design.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a DAG-based approach can enable an asynchronous BAB protocol to achieve multiple desirable properties simultaneously, which was not possible with prior approaches. The paper makes contributions through the design, analysis and evaluation of the DAG-Rider protocol to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here is a summary of the main contributions of the paper:- The paper presents DAG-Rider, the first asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (BAB) protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. - BAB is important for building practical Byzantine fault tolerant systems. Previous protocols like VABA and Dumbo achieved some of these optimality properties but not all.- DAG-Rider constructs the BAB protocol in two layers - a communication layer that builds a DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure, and a zero-overhead ordering layer that uses the DAG to order messages with no extra communication.- The propose operation in DAG-Rider is just a single reliable broadcast. The DAG ensures agreement and the validity property of reliable broadcast guarantees all values from correct processes are eventually included.- To order messages, each process assigns them to "waves" in the DAG and tries to commit a single randomly chosen leader for each wave. Once the leaders are chosen, their causal histories in the DAG are delivered. - For safety, DAG-Rider only relies on cryptographic assumptions for liveness. Using a threshold coin, its safety properties are post-quantum secure.- With the right reliable broadcast instantiation, DAG-Rider achieves optimal O(n) amortized communication complexity and O(1) expected time complexity to order n values.In summary, the main contribution is an elegant asynchronous BAB protocol that matches several theoretical optimally bounds and provides post-quantum safety.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work in asynchronous Byzantine consensus protocols:- This paper presents the DAG-Rider protocol, which achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity for asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast. Previous protocols like VABA and Dumbo achieve some of these properties, but not all three optimally.- Unlike VABA and Dumbo which rely on cryptographic signatures and assumptions for both safety and liveness, DAG-Rider uses information theoretic techniques to ensure safety without signatures or asymmetric cryptography. This makes its safety properties post-quantum secure. It only relies on cryptographic assumptions for liveness.- DAG-Rider satisfies a stronger validity property than most previous protocols, ensuring all values proposed by correct processes are eventually ordered. Protocols like VABA and Dumbo can ignore some correct proposals for efficiency. - The paper compares DAG-Rider to VABA and Dumbo based SMR solutions. While VABA/Dumbo have expected O(log n) time complexity, DAG-Rider achieves expected constant time, which is optimal. - The communication complexity of DAG-Rider is analyzed with different reliable broadcast implementations. With an information dispersal scheme, it achieves optimal O(n) amortized communication complexity.- The paper highlights the elegant design of DAG-Rider, with its modular separation of the communication layer and ordering logic. The total ordering logic is only about 30 lines of code.- Unlike some previous DAG-based ordering protocols like HashGraph and Aleph, DAG-Rider provably achieves optimal complexity bounds and does not rely on signatures for safety.In summary, DAG-Rider advances the state of the art for asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast across several metrics like security, validity, time complexity, and elegant design. The analysis and comparison to other protocols highlights these advances.

The authors suggest a few possible future research directions:- Improving the latency/throughput tradeoff: The paper presents a protocol with good throughput but high latency. The authors suggest exploring protocols that can achieve a better balance between latency and throughput.- Supporting proof of stake: The protocol currently assumes a proof of work style blockchain.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents DAG-Rider, an asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. The protocol is constructed in two layers - a communication layer where processes reliably broadcast proposals and build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of messages, and a zero-overhead ordering layer where processes locally observe their DAGs to totally order the proposals without any extra communication. The protocol ensures all values proposed by correct processes are eventually delivered, and is post-quantum safe as it does not rely on signatures or asymmetric cryptography for safety. The modular design allows plugging in different reliable broadcast implementations to achieve different complexity tradeoffs. With optimal complexity and elegant design, DAG-Rider is presented as a promising protocol for asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents DAG-Rider, an asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (BAB) protocol that achieves optimal resilience, optimal amortized communication complexity, and optimal time complexity. The protocol is constructed in two layers - a communication layer where processes reliably broadcast proposals to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and a zero-overhead ordering layer where processes observe their local DAGs and totally order the proposals without any extra communication. In the communication layer, processes broadcast proposals in rounds along with metadata to help build the DAG. Each broadcast references the previous round's broadcasts. In the ordering layer, processes divide the DAG into waves and use a global coin to randomly select a leader proposal for each wave. If enough processes observe the leader, it is committed along with all causally preceding proposals. By committing a leader every few waves in expectation, the protocol achieves O(1) time complexity. The protocol is post-quantum safe and does not rely on signatures for safety. With the right reliable broadcast instantiation, it achieves optimal O(n) amortized communication complexity.In summary, this is the first protocol to achieve optimal complexity along with asynchronous safety and eventual liveness for the Byzantine Atomic Broadcast problem. The modular design and analysis make it an promising candidate for asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant systems.
