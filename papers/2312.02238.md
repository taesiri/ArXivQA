# [X-Adapter: Adding Universal Compatibility of Plugins for Upgraded   Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image diffusion models are rapidly evolving with newer upgraded versions (e.g. SDXL) being released, which have better quality and capabilities. 
- However, all the existing plugins (e.g. ControlNet, LoRA) trained on the base model (e.g. Stable Diffusion 1.5) need expensive retraining to work with upgraded models. This hampers wider application.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes X-Adapter - a small trainable adapter network to enable direct use of old plugins on new upgraded diffusion models without any retraining.

- X-Adapter comprises of the base model itself to retain plugin connectors, along with trainable mapping layers to transform base model features to guide upgraded model's decoder.

- A two-stage inference strategy is used: first base model + plugin runs partially to warm up, then the mapping layers guide upgraded model for final high-quality image.

Main Contributions:
- Enables one-time training of an adapter to upgrade all old plugins to new diffusion models, instead of training each one separately.

- Achieves performance gain over base model and also preserves semantic, style control abilities of plugins.

- Supports remixing plugins across model versions for more capabilities.

- Extensive experiments validate X-Adapter allows ControlNet, LoRA and other plugins to directly work with SDXL and SD 2.1 without needing retraining.

In summary, the paper facilitates wider application of newer text-to-image diffusion models by upgrading old plugins with minor training, while retaining and enhancing their capabilities.
