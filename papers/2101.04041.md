# [Evaluating Disentanglement of Structured Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04041)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in the paper is how to evaluate the degree of disentanglement in structured generative representations, specifically object-centric representations with multiple latent slots. Disentanglement refers to the property that information about different underlying factors of variation is separated in the latent representation. The key ideas are:- Existing disentanglement metrics are limited to evaluating disentanglement of individual factors/dimensions and do not account for representation structure. This is a problem for object-centric models where the structure of multiple slots is critical.- The authors propose a new unified framework to evaluate disentanglement at different hierarchy levels of a structured representation, through projections of the affinity matrix.- For object-centric models, this allows systematic evaluation of (i) object separation between slots (ii) disentanglement inside slots (iii) disentanglement of intrinsic vs extrinsic properties.- Theoretically, the authors show this framework provides stronger guarantees than prior flat disentanglement metrics when selecting a good model.- A core technical contribution is a new probing algorithm to obtain feature importances that are permutation invariant with respect to slots.In summary, the key research question is how to properly evaluate disentanglement in structured generative models like object-centric representations, which requires developing new metrics and algorithms adapted to this structure. The authors propose a principled framework addressing this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing the first metric for evaluating disentanglement at individual hierarchy levels of a structured latent representation. More specifically:- The paper introduces a framework to measure disentanglement in structured latent representations such as object-centric generative models. This allows evaluating object separation between slots, disentanglement inside slots, and disentanglement across hierarchy levels like intrinsic vs extrinsic properties. - The proposed metric is based on computing affinities between factors of variation and latent dimensions, and then projecting these affinities to different subsets of the hierarchy. This provides a unified way to quantify properties like object-level disentanglement, slot disentanglement, and slot symmetry.- The framework generalizes traditional disentanglement metrics like DCI and provides stronger guarantees about selecting good models. Theorems formally show that it contains DCI as a special case, and that 1D projections can substitute prior unstructured metrics.- A novel permutation invariant feature importance algorithm is presented to handle slot permutation invariance and obtain suitable affinity scores. - Experiments on MONet, GENESIS and IODINE highlight issues with using pixel-level metrics, provide insights about learned representations, and showcase applicability of the structured disentanglement framework.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first principled metric tailored to structured latent representations like object-centric generative models, with strong theoretical guarantees and demonstrated experimental applicability. The framework addresses limitations of previous disentanglement and visual segmentation metrics for this setting.
