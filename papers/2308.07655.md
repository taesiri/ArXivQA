# [From Commit Message Generation to History-Aware Commit Message   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. How do state-of-the-art commit message generation (CMG) approaches perform when adapted to a commit message completion setting instead of full generation? 2. How do large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 perform on commit message generation and completion compared to state-of-the-art CMG models?3. Does using commit message history as additional context improve the performance of CMG models on generation and completion? 4. Do common data filtering steps used in prior CMG research significantly impact model performance on a more diverse dataset?The key ideas explored are:- Reframing CMG as commit message completion instead of full generation.- Using commit message history as context for CMG models. - Training/evaluating on a new diverse dataset (CommitChronicle) that keeps full histories.- Comparing CMG models to GPT-3.5 in generation and completion settings.- Analyzing impact of common data filters used in prior CMG research.The main hypotheses appear to be that completion and history will improve CMG model quality, while restrictive filtering may inflate prior reported results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, this paper makes the following key contributions:1. It proposes and evaluates two novel ideas for improving commit message generation: reframing it as commit message completion, and using the commit history as additional context. 2. It collects and releases a new large-scale, multilingual dataset called CommitChronicle with around 10.7M commits in 20 languages. This dataset keeps the commit history to enable experiments with using history as context.3. It compares several state-of-the-art commit message generation models (CodeT5, RACE, CodeReviewer) and the large language model GPT-3.5-turbo on the tasks of commit message generation and completion, with and without history as context. 4. The results show that completion is easier than generation, and using history as context improves performance for some models in some settings. The authors also analyze the impact of common restrictive filters used in prior datasets.5. Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of the two proposed ideas - completion and using history - for improving commit message generation, through comprehensive experiments and analysis. The new CommitChronicle dataset and the thorough comparison of models are also valuable contributions.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and initially validating two novel approaches for more personalized and higher quality commit message generation, supported by a new diverse dataset and extensive experiments with multiple state-of-the-art models.
