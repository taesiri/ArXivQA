# [From Commit Message Generation to History-Aware Commit Message   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. How do state-of-the-art commit message generation (CMG) approaches perform when adapted to a commit message completion setting instead of full generation? 2. How do large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 perform on commit message generation and completion compared to state-of-the-art CMG models?3. Does using commit message history as additional context improve the performance of CMG models on generation and completion? 4. Do common data filtering steps used in prior CMG research significantly impact model performance on a more diverse dataset?The key ideas explored are:- Reframing CMG as commit message completion instead of full generation.- Using commit message history as context for CMG models. - Training/evaluating on a new diverse dataset (CommitChronicle) that keeps full histories.- Comparing CMG models to GPT-3.5 in generation and completion settings.- Analyzing impact of common data filters used in prior CMG research.The main hypotheses appear to be that completion and history will improve CMG model quality, while restrictive filtering may inflate prior reported results.
