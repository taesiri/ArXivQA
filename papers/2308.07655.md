# [From Commit Message Generation to History-Aware Commit Message   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. How do state-of-the-art commit message generation (CMG) approaches perform when adapted to a commit message completion setting instead of full generation? 

2. How do large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 perform on commit message generation and completion compared to state-of-the-art CMG models?

3. Does using commit message history as additional context improve the performance of CMG models on generation and completion? 

4. Do common data filtering steps used in prior CMG research significantly impact model performance on a more diverse dataset?

The key ideas explored are:

- Reframing CMG as commit message completion instead of full generation.

- Using commit message history as context for CMG models. 

- Training/evaluating on a new diverse dataset (CommitChronicle) that keeps full histories.

- Comparing CMG models to GPT-3.5 in generation and completion settings.

- Analyzing impact of common data filters used in prior CMG research.

The main hypotheses appear to be that completion and history will improve CMG model quality, while restrictive filtering may inflate prior reported results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, this paper makes the following key contributions:

1. It proposes and evaluates two novel ideas for improving commit message generation: reframing it as commit message completion, and using the commit history as additional context. 

2. It collects and releases a new large-scale, multilingual dataset called CommitChronicle with around 10.7M commits in 20 languages. This dataset keeps the commit history to enable experiments with using history as context.

3. It compares several state-of-the-art commit message generation models (CodeT5, RACE, CodeReviewer) and the large language model GPT-3.5-turbo on the tasks of commit message generation and completion, with and without history as context. 

4. The results show that completion is easier than generation, and using history as context improves performance for some models in some settings. The authors also analyze the impact of common restrictive filters used in prior datasets.

5. Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of the two proposed ideas - completion and using history - for improving commit message generation, through comprehensive experiments and analysis. The new CommitChronicle dataset and the thorough comparison of models are also valuable contributions.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and initially validating two novel approaches for more personalized and higher quality commit message generation, supported by a new diverse dataset and extensive experiments with multiple state-of-the-art models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of commit message generation:

- The key novel ideas proposed in this paper are reframing commit message generation as completion (rather than full generation) and using commit history as context. As the authors note, these specific ideas have not been explored before for commit message generation. 

- Existing commit message generation papers have focused solely on full generation, not completion. They also typically use only the commit diff as context, not commit history. So this work explores new settings.

- The paper introduces a new diverse commit message dataset, CommitChronicle, that contains full commit histories. This addresses limitations of prior datasets that had limited or altered commit histories.

- The study compares several state-of-the-art commit message generation models like CodeT5, RACE, and CodeReviewer. It finds they have fairly similar performance, with RACE being slightly better. This aligns with recent literature.

- The examination of completion vs generation and use of history are novel contributions not found in prior work. The findings show potential benefits but also areas needing more research.

- The analysis of how restrictive data filtering impacts results provides new insights about potential inflated metrics in prior datasets. This suggests models may not work as well on diverse commits.

Overall, the core ideas around completion and history appear to be novel contributions compared to prior commit message generation literature. The paper also provides one of the most thorough studies of multiple state-of-the-art models on a new diverse dataset. The findings point out open challenges, particularly around more diverse commits.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, the authors suggest several potential future research directions:

- Conduct deeper analysis of commits that current CMG approaches struggle with to uncover new challenges and opportunities for improvement. The authors note that generating messages for commits outside common filters presents new difficulties, so studying these cases could benefit the field.

- Explore different ways of integrating commit message history into models beyond their simple concatenation approach, such as developing separate models to represent writing style and conventions.

- Experiment with other large language models besides GPT-3.5-turbo and try more advanced prompt engineering techniques to see if performance can be improved.

- Perform human evaluation of generated commit messages to gain insights beyond automatic metrics, especially regarding the ideas of completion and history integration.

- Investigate applicability of recent semantic metrics based on large language models as judges to evaluate quality aspects like adequacy and usefulness.

- Additional filtering of their CommitChronicle dataset may be needed to address potential data quality concerns around commit messages.

- Expand to support languages beyond the 20 already included and proprietary codebases to increase generalizability.

In summary, they highlight opportunities to analyze model errors, refine techniques for personalization, conduct human studies, improve evaluation, enhance data quality, and expand language and domain coverage.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates two novel ideas for improving the quality and personalization of automatically generated commit messages: using commit message completion instead of full generation, and utilizing a developer's commit history as additional context. The authors collect a new diverse, multilingual dataset called CommitChronicle containing 10.7 million commits that preserves commit history information. They conduct experiments with state-of-the-art commit message generation models like CodeT5, RACE, and CodeReviewer, as well as the large language model GPT-3.5-turbo, comparing their performance on commit message generation versus completion and with versus without commit history as context. The results show that completion is often easier than full generation, and that commit history can improve performance in some cases, especially for generation. The authors also analyze the impact of restrictive data filtering used in prior work, finding it excludes many real commits and may inflate results. Overall, the work provides promising initial evidence that completion and history could help personalize and improve commit message generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates two novel ideas to improve the quality and personal nature of generated commit messages: using commit message completion instead of generation, and using previous commit history as additional context. The authors collected a new dataset called CommitChronicle with 10.7 million commits across 20 languages that retains the commit history. They evaluated state-of-the-art commit message generation models like CodeT5, RACE, and CodeReviewer in both generation and completion settings, with and without commit history. The results showed that completion is easier than generation, and using history improves performance for generation but not always for completion. The authors also evaluated the large language model GPT-3.5-turbo, which performed worse overall but showed potential for long detailed messages. Restrictive filtering of datasets was found to inflate results compared to diverse unfiltered data. 

In summary, the key ideas proposed and evaluated were reframing commit message generation as completion, and utilizing commit history as context. Experiments using a new diverse dataset CommitChronicle demonstrated these ideas have potential in specific scenarios. The findings also highlighted issues with existing datasets lacking history and using restrictive filters. Further research is needed on different ways to integrate history and evaluating semantic quality, but overall the work provides new approaches to improve commit message generation through personalization and evaluation on more realistic diverse data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates two novel ideas for improving commit message generation - using commit message completion instead of full generation, and utilizing commit message history as additional context. To evaluate these ideas, the authors collect a new large-scale, multilingual dataset called CommitChronicle with over 10 million commits across 20 languages, which retains commit metadata like authors and timestamps. They experiment with three state-of-the-art commit message generation models (CodeT5, RACE, and CodeReviewer) as well as the large language model GPT-3.5-turbo on this dataset. The models are evaluated in four configurations: generation vs completion, with and without commit history. Various metrics are used to assess the quality of generated messages, including BLEU, edit similarity, and exact match. The results show that completion is easier than full generation, and using history improves performance for some models in some contexts. The findings suggest both ideas have potential in specific scenarios but require further research.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 I do not have enough context to provide a high-quality summary of the full research paper based only on its LaTeX code and formatting. A proper summary would require carefully reading and analyzing the full contents and contributions of the paper. However, if forced to provide a very rough one-sentence summary based solely on the limited information given, it might be something like: 

"This paper presents ideas around improving commit message generation through techniques like completion instead of full generation and using commit history as context, as well as analysis of existing datasets."

Again, this is an extremely crude summary without reading the actual content, but it tries to loosely capture some of the key themes around commit messages, generation vs completion, history, and datasets based on the fragmentary information available in the LaTeX formatting. A proper summary would require much more thorough analysis.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some key terms and concepts that seem most relevant are:

- Commit message generation (CMG) - The task of automatically generating commit messages from code changes. This is a core focus of the paper.

- Commit message completion - A novel reformulation of CMG proposed in the paper, where models generate a completion for a prefix of a commit message typed by the user.

- Commit history/context - Using a developer's previous commit messages as additional context when generating new commit messages, to improve personalization. 

- Dataset limitations - Existing CMG datasets lack commit history and use restrictive filtering, reducing diversity.

- CommitChronicle dataset - New large-scale, multilingual, history-aware CMG dataset collected and shared in this work.

- Model evaluation - Comparison of CMG models like CodeT5, RACE, CodeReviewer and GPT-3.5-turbo on tasks of commit message generation vs completion, with and without history.

- Results - Main findings showing potential of completion and history in certain cases, need for further research. Overall importance of diversity and avoiding restrictive filtering.

The key themes seem to be around rethinking commit message generation as completion, using history for personalization, the need for more diverse datasets, and benchmarking both existing CMG models and large language models on these new perspectives.
