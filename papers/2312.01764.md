# [Dynamic Erasing Network Based on Multi-Scale Temporal Features for   Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01764)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Dynamic Erasing Network (DE-Net) for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that addresses two key limitations of prior work: (1) fixed video segment lengths that ignore varying anomaly durations, and (2) bias towards detecting only the most prominent anomalies while overlooking more subtle ones. The core ideas are a Multi-Scale Temporal Modeling (MSTM) module to represent anomalies across different durations by extracting both local and global features from varying temporal scales, and a Dynamic Erasing (DE) strategy that selectively erases the most prominent detected anomalies to force discovering the more subtle ones. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets. The ablation studies validate the individual contribution of the MSTM and DE components. Both qualitative results and analysis of the erasing process over training iterations confirm that the approach progressively detects more complete anomalies. In summary, by explicitly handling varying anomaly durations and strategically erasing prominent detections to seek overlooked anomalies, the proposed DE-Net advances the state-of-the-art in weakly supervised video anomaly detection.
