# [ArtBank: Artistic Style Transfer with Pre-trained Diffusion Model and   Implicit Style Prompt Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06135)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework that can generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving the content structure of the original image. The key innovation is an Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB) - a set of trainable parameter matrices that can learn and store style information from collections of artworks. To accelerate training of the ISPB, a Spatial-Statistical Self-Attention Module (SSAM) is introduced which extracts spatial and statistical information from the parameter matrices. During inference, the ISPB style representations are combined with CLIP text embeddings and fed into the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to guide artistic image generation. Comparisons to state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods show ArtBank produces higher quality stylized images that better preserve content structure. Both qualitative results and quantitative metrics like CLIP score and human preference votes demonstrate the superiority of ArtBank over existing approaches. The method provides a novel way to effectively utilize both external artwork data and knowledge already embedded in large pre-trained models.
