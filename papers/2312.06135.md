# [ArtBank: Artistic Style Transfer with Pre-trained Diffusion Model and   Implicit Style Prompt Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06135)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework that can generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving the content structure of the original image. The key innovation is an Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB) - a set of trainable parameter matrices that can learn and store style information from collections of artworks. To accelerate training of the ISPB, a Spatial-Statistical Self-Attention Module (SSAM) is introduced which extracts spatial and statistical information from the parameter matrices. During inference, the ISPB style representations are combined with CLIP text embeddings and fed into the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to guide artistic image generation. Comparisons to state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods show ArtBank produces higher quality stylized images that better preserve content structure. Both qualitative results and quantitative metrics like CLIP score and human preference votes demonstrate the superiority of ArtBank over existing approaches. The method provides a novel way to effectively utilize both external artwork data and knowledge already embedded in large pre-trained models.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework with an Implicit Style Prompt Bank to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure by exploiting prior knowledge in pre-trained diffusion models and learning style information from artwork collections.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel artistic style transfer framework called ArtBank, which can generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving the content structure. This is achieved through the Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB), which learns and stores style information from multiple collections of artworks and digs out the prior knowledge from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models.

2. Proposing the Spatial-Statistical Self-Attention Module (SSAM) to accelerate the training of the ISPB. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on multiple collections of artworks and showing state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic stylized images compared to existing methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB) to learn and store style information from different artwork collections. Can you explain in more detail how the ISPB is designed and how it learns the artistic styles? 

2. The Spatial-Statistical Self-Attention Module (SSAM) is used to accelerate the training of the ISPB. Can you elaborate on why traditional self-attention modules are not sufficient and how the spatial and statistical attentions in SSAM help optimize the training?

3. The paper mentions using a stochastic inversion process during inference to help preserve content structure. What is stochastic inversion and why is random noise important for preserving content structure?

4. The method relies on embedding vectors from CLIP to guide the image generation process. What are the advantages of using CLIP embeddings over other conditioning approaches? How are the text and style embeddings combined?

5. How does the training process balance extracting style information from the artwork collections and utilizing the prior knowledge already within the Stable Diffusion model? What prevents losing the model's ability to generate realistic images?

6. Qualitative results show the method generates more realistic stylizations than small model approaches while preserving better structure than diffusion models alone. What are the key differences allowing this method to achieve both qualities simultaneously?  

7. The paper compares optimization efficiency against other self-attention modules. Why does the proposed SSAM accelerate training compared to other self-attentions? What specifically causes it to converge faster?

8. How does the method scale to handling multiple diverse artwork collections? What allows it to learn distinct styles from each collection?

9. Ablations show degradations when removing components like text prompts or changing the attention module. Can you analyze these ablation results and explain the impact of each component?

10. Compared to inversion-based style transfer approaches, what advantages does learning separate style representations have? Why is directly finetuning the diffusion model not an ideal approach?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing artistic style transfer methods have limitations in generating highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure. Small model-based methods can preserve content structure but fail to produce realistic stylized images and introduce artifacts. Large pre-trained model-based methods can generate realistic stylized images but struggle to preserve content structure.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure. The key components are:

1) Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB): A set of trainable parameter matrices that can learn and store style information from collections of artworks. It behaves as a visual prompt to guide the pre-trained diffusion model to generate realistic stylized images while preserving structure.

2) Spatial-Statistical Self-Attention Module (SSAM): A novel attention module to accelerate training of ISPB by evaluating parameter changes from spatial and statistical perspectives.  

3) Stochastic Inversion: Adds noise to the content image, predicts it using the diffusion model's denoising U-Net, and uses the predicted noise as input during inference. This helps preserve content structure.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes ArtBank framework to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure by using ISPB to guide pre-trained diffusion model.

- Designs novel SSAM module to accelerate training of ISPB.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on artistic style transfer, outperforming existing small model-based and large pre-trained model-based methods.

- Provides extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate superiority over existing methods.
