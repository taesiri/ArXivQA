# [Modeling Risk in Reinforcement Learning: A Literature Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05231)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a systematic literature mapping of risk representation and management in safe reinforcement learning (RL). The authors performed a comprehensive survey of 72 recent papers on safe RL and identified 178 distinct risk factors. They propose a general definition of risk in RL along with a taxonomy for characterizing risk based on attributes like source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency, and timing. The most common types of risk factors found were hazard states, death states, random transitions, constraints, and costs. The prevalent application domains were toy problems, engineering, and computer science, with relatively little work in economics or medicine. The most widely used techniques were constrained optimization criteria, weighted sums of return and risk, and risk-directed exploration. Key findings indicate research gaps exist in multi-domain approaches, highly severe risk scenarios, seeded knowledge for exploration, and modeling risk in economics/medicine problems. The authors provide guidance on accounting for risk factors in experiments and encourage detailed risk reporting in papers. They argue explicit risk characterization will enable improved technique comparisons and transfer learning between application domains in safe RL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a systematic literature mapping of risk representation in safe reinforcement learning, proposing a general definition and characterization of risk to encourage more explicit accounting of risk in RL research across domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

"Our aim is to encourage the research community to adopt an explicit and detailed account of risk in RL approaches. As RL research transfers to more practical applications, it is necessary to articulate more clearly how risk is modeled in RL approaches. Risk-aware techniques can be potentially used in more application domains with only small modifications, thus serving a larger crowd. We hope this mapping is useful for researchers or practitioners considering the implementation of RL in their application domains."

In essence, the key contribution is proposing a unified, domain-agnostic framework to characterize and define risk in reinforcement learning research. This is intended to help standardize how risk is reported across different application areas, allowing for easier comparison and potential transfer of techniques between areas. The paper also provides an overview of trends in how risk is currently treated across different RL application domains.

The paper presents a systematic literature mapping study focused on characterizing and defining risk in the context of safe reinforcement learning. It proposes a risk taxonomy and set of risk attributes that can be used to characterize different types of risks across reinforcement learning domains. The study maps out research trends in terms of application domains where risk is modeled in RL and the different RL techniques used. Some key terms like "safe reinforcement learning", "risk representation", "risk taxonomy", "risk factors", and "risk attributes" are central to the paper's discussion and contributions around formalizing the notion of risk in RL.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a set of attributes to characterize risk factors in reinforcement learning. What is the rationale behind choosing the specific attributes of source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency and timing? What other attributes could potentially be useful to characterize risk?

2. The paper identifies 13 types of risk factors such as hazard states, death states, random transitions, etc. What is the process used to group risk factors into these types? What are the key differences between hazard states and death states as categories of risk?

3. The paper maps risk factors to domains like toy problems, engineering, economics, etc. But the distribution of risk factors varies greatly across domains. What could explain this variation? Does it mean the risk taxonomy may need to be adapted for different domains?

4. The paper finds that multi-domain studies are scarce in safe RL research. Why is it challenging to develop safe RL techniques that can work across multiple domains? What modifications would be needed to make techniques more domain-agnostic?  

5. The paper encourages more complex, real-world experiments beyond standardized benchmarks. What are some examples of complex risk-aware RL problems that could drive progress in the field? What barriers need to be overcome to set up such experiments?

6. The risk taxonomy is based on an earlier work by Garcia et al. Are there any new categories of techniques that need to be added to this taxonomy based on recent advancements in safe RL research?

7. The paper suggests multi-objective RL as a potential area for managing negative rewards or risks. How can multi-objective formulations help shape agent behavior while avoiding extensive reward tuning?   

8. What is the role of best practices like risk profiling and explicit risk accounting in improving the safety and reliability of RL systems? How can these practices be standardized?

9. The paper does not find examples of worst-case criteria for risk in RL. When would such techniques be suitable or unsuitable for dealing with risk?

10. How can we develop a systematic methodology and set of tools for identifying, characterizing and mitigating risks in the design of RL experiments? What elements would such a methodology contain?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents seek to maximize reward, which can lead them into unsafe situations in real-world environments. Thus there is a need for "safe RL" techniques.
- However, there is no standard notion of modeling or representing "risk" in RL. Risk has been handled in a domain-specific way, making it hard to compare or transfer techniques.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors perform a systematic literature review, analyzing 72 papers on safe RL. 
- They propose a general ontology for defining and characterizing risk in RL, with attributes like: source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency and timing.
- Using this ontology, they map how risk has been represented across application domains like robotics, finance, healthcare etc.

Key Contributions:
- A formal definition and associated ontology for risk factors in RL that can work across domains. Includes external attributes like source, target, severity and internal attributes like uncertainty, interference etc.
- An analysis of 172 risk factors identified from the literature, classified based on this ontology. Finds most common areas are hazard states, death states, constraints. 
- Identification of application domains where RL has modeled risk, finding a predominance of engineering and toy problems. Lack of multi-domain studies modeling risk.
- An overall characterization of risk representation in safe RL literature.
- A discussion of implications, including the need for explicit risk modeling in designing RL environments, use of multi-objective RL, and potential areas of future research.

The paper contributes a general framework and vocabulary for clearly articulating, comparing and re-using risk representation techniques across application domains in safe RL.
