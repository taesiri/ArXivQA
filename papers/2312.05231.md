# [Modeling Risk in Reinforcement Learning: A Literature Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05231)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a systematic literature mapping of risk representation and management in safe reinforcement learning (RL). The authors performed a comprehensive survey of 72 recent papers on safe RL and identified 178 distinct risk factors. They propose a general definition of risk in RL along with a taxonomy for characterizing risk based on attributes like source, target, severity, uncertainty, interference, frequency, and timing. The most common types of risk factors found were hazard states, death states, random transitions, constraints, and costs. The prevalent application domains were toy problems, engineering, and computer science, with relatively little work in economics or medicine. The most widely used techniques were constrained optimization criteria, weighted sums of return and risk, and risk-directed exploration. Key findings indicate research gaps exist in multi-domain approaches, highly severe risk scenarios, seeded knowledge for exploration, and modeling risk in economics/medicine problems. The authors provide guidance on accounting for risk factors in experiments and encourage detailed risk reporting in papers. They argue explicit risk characterization will enable improved technique comparisons and transfer learning between application domains in safe RL.
