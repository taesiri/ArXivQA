# [SHERF: Generalizable Human NeRF from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a generalizable neural radiance field model that can reconstruct animatable 3D humans from a single input image? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) By learning a hierarchical feature bank comprising global, point-level, and pixel-aligned features, the model can enhance observable information from the input image and complement missing information, enabling high-fidelity novel view and pose synthesis from just a single image.2) By transforming image features into a canonical pose space via SMPL and fusing them effectively, the model can acquire coherent 3D structure understanding to reconstruct animatable humans.3) The proposed model architecture and training methodology will outperform previous state-of-the-art generalizable human NeRF methods designed for multi-view inputs.So in summary, the central research question is how to develop the first generalizable and animatable human NeRF from single images, which is addressed through the key hypotheses around using a hierarchical 3D-aware feature bank and canonical space encoding. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparison to previous SOTA approaches.
