# [SHERF: Generalizable Human NeRF from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a generalizable neural radiance field model that can reconstruct animatable 3D humans from a single input image? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By learning a hierarchical feature bank comprising global, point-level, and pixel-aligned features, the model can enhance observable information from the input image and complement missing information, enabling high-fidelity novel view and pose synthesis from just a single image.

2) By transforming image features into a canonical pose space via SMPL and fusing them effectively, the model can acquire coherent 3D structure understanding to reconstruct animatable humans.

3) The proposed model architecture and training methodology will outperform previous state-of-the-art generalizable human NeRF methods designed for multi-view inputs.

So in summary, the central research question is how to develop the first generalizable and animatable human NeRF from single images, which is addressed through the key hypotheses around using a hierarchical 3D-aware feature bank and canonical space encoding. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparison to previous SOTA approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing the first generalizable Human NeRF model called SHERF that can recover animatable 3D humans from a single image input. This pushes the boundaries of Human NeRF to a more challenging and practical setting compared to prior work that required multi-view images or videos.

2. Designing a bank of 3D-aware hierarchical features, including global, point-level, and pixel-aligned features, to encode both global structure/appearance and local fine details from the single image input. This allows complementing missing information and preserving visible details. 

3. Using a feature fusion transformer to effectively integrate the hierarchical features for high quality novel view and pose synthesis.

4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets for generalizable human NeRF from a single image, outperforming previous methods. The extensive experiments and analyses provide insights into the method.

5. The proposed SHERF framework bridges the gap between Human NeRF research and real-world application requirements, where often only single random-view images are available. It moves towards practical uses of animatable Human NeRF.

In summary, the key novelty is being the first to tackle generalizable and animatable Human NeRF from just a single image, using ideas like the hierarchical 3D-aware features and feature transformer to enable plausible view and pose synthesis. The results are a significant advance over prior arts.
