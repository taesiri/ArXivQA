# [I Can't Believe There's No Images! Learning Visual Tasks Using only   Language Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09778)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether it is possible to learn high-level visual skills, such as parsing questions, comparing semantics, and generating descriptions, by transferring those skills from natural language training data to computer vision tasks without using any visual training data. 

The key hypothesis is that the high-level semantics needed for many vision and language tasks have significant overlap, and therefore models can learn those skills from natural language data and then apply them to visual inputs if both modalities are encoded into a shared semantic space.

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called CLOSE that exploits jointly trained contrastive vision-language models like CLIP to embed visual and textual inputs into a common semantic vector space. It then studies whether models trained on textual training data alone in this space can effectively transfer to visual inputs at test time.

The authors evaluate this cross-modal transfer hypothesis on a range of vision and language tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. Their results generally show a surprisingly small drop in performance compared to models trained with visual data, demonstrating efficient transfer is possible for high-level semantics between vision and language using this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for zero-shot cross-modal transfer learning using contrastive models. Specifically:

- They introduce CLOSE, a method that can train models on textual data alone and then apply them to visual inputs at test time. This allows transferring skills learned from text data to visual tasks. 

- They show CLOSE is effective on a range of vision and language tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, visual entailment, and visual news captioning. The text-only CLOSE models achieve results surprisingly close to models trained directly on images.

- They demonstrate an application of CLOSE for stylistic image captioning by training on diverse text sources like books, web data, and language model generations. This allows captioning in different styles without using any labeled image data.

- They analyze CLOSE's robustness to the "modality gap" between text and image vectors in contrastive models. They show it is insensitive to constant offsets and study more complex adapters to align the modalities.

- Overall, the ability to transfer from text data to visual tasks using contrastive models is shown to be not only achievable, but produce strong results. This could enable training on text data which is often cheaper to collect than visual data.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling zero-shot cross-modal transfer for vision tasks by exploiting contrastive models trained on large amounts of text and image data. The effectiveness of learning complex vision skills purely from text data is demonstrated.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called CLOSE that allows models to learn visual skills like image captioning, visual entailment, and visual question answering using only natural language training data by leveraging contrastively trained visual-language models like CLIP to map images and text into a shared embedding space.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on using contrastive vision-language models for cross-modal transfer learning:

- The main novelty is training models on text data alone and applying them to images, which enables zero-shot cross-modal transfer. This is a relatively new idea that has been explored by a few recent papers such as ESPER Style and TAP-C, but this paper takes it further by testing on more tasks and proposing methods to address the image-text domain shift like Gaussian noise.

- Compared to other zero-shot methods like MAGIC and Socratic Models, this approach achieves much better performance by fine-tuning the model with task-specific text data. It doesn't require the model to work fully zero-shot.

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work on the text-only setting for captioning, visual entailment, and visual news. It advances the capabilities of models trained without images.

- It provides analysis on the image-text domain shift and how different adapters can help address it. This helps explain why the method works and how it could potentially be improved further.

- Compared to other zero-shot multi-modal models, this approach has advantages like working well with smaller language models and allowing task-specific fine-tuning.

- The application to stylistic captioning demonstrates a useful benefit of training on diverse text sources and transferring to images.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the idea of training on text and transferring to images using contrastive models. The analyses and experiments on multiple datasets help validate this approach and the comparisons to other methods demonstrate the state-of-the-art capabilities it can achieve. The proposed techniques help overcome key challenges like the image-text domain shift.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Continue exploring other modalities beyond text and images. The authors suggest their approach could generalize to other contrastive models that connect modalities like videos, audio, point clouds, etc. This could expand the applicability of their method to allow for more kinds of cross-modal transfer.

- Use more powerful contrastive models. The authors show performance improves when using larger contrastive models like OpenCLIP and EVA-CLIP. Developing and applying even more advanced contrastive models could further improve the effectiveness of their approach. 

- Find better methods for choosing or tuning the noise level. The addition of Gaussian noise is important for their approach, but currently simple heuristics are used to set the noise level. More principled methods for selecting the noise could improve results.

- Apply the method to more use cases that leverage its ability to train with only text data. The authors suggest applications like training on text summaries to do video captioning, using textbook data to learn to caption images of procedures, and learning from text to caption new modalities like graphs.

- Further explore the generated stylistic captions. The paper shows promising results on generating stylistic captions from text sources, more work could be done to improve the image relevance and stylistic consistency.

- Continue analyzing differences between text and image embeddings. While the authors provide some analysis, further work to deeply understand the embedding differences could inspire new methods to improve their approach.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the modalities and tasks the method can be applied to, improving various components like the contrastive models and noise modeling, and further analysis to guide improvements. The overall goal is to advance cross-modal transfer to enable more flexible training across data modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called CLOSE (Cross modaL transfer On Semantic Embeddings) for learning visual tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment using only natural language supervision. The key idea is to leverage contrastively trained vision and language models like CLIP that embed images and text into a shared semantic space. During training, the text input is encoded with the frozen CLIP text encoder and used to train a task model (e.g. a captioning model). During inference, images are encoded with the CLIP image encoder instead. This allows the model to transfer from text to images at test time. The authors show this approach achieves strong performance on various vision tasks while only requiring text annotations for training. They demonstrate the promise of this technique on applications like generating stylistic image captions using only stylistic text data. The paper also analyzes the "modality gap" between CLIP's text and image embeddings, and shows the approach is robust to constant shifts between embeddings. Overall, this is an intriguing demonstration of how skills learned from language can transfer to visual tasks in a zero-shot cross-modal manner when using shared semantic embedding spaces.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Cross modaL transfer On Semantic Embeddings (CLOSE) for zero-shot cross-modal transfer learning. The key idea is to leverage contrastively trained vision and language models like CLIP to encode inputs from different modalities into a shared semantic space. At training time, text inputs are encoded with the text encoder and used to train a model for a vision task like captioning or VQA. At test time, images are encoded with the image encoder and substituted in place of the text embeddings, allowing the model to generalize to images without any visual training data. 

The authors demonstrate this approach on four vision and language tasks: image captioning, visual entailment, visual question answering, and visual news captioning. The text-only trained models achieve reasonable performance compared to models trained on images, with only a 5-8% drop on most tasks. This shows efficient transfer is possible using their method. The paper also analyzes the "modality gap" between text and image embeddings and studies different adapters to help address it. Overall, the work presents an effective approach for zero-shot cross-modal transfer learning using contrastive models like CLIP.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Cross modaL transfer On Semantic Embeddings (CLOSE) for zero-shot cross-modal transfer learning. The key idea is to leverage the joint embedding space learned by contrastive vision-language models like CLIP to allow models trained purely on textual data to transfer to visual tasks. During training, the input text is encoded into a vector using CLIP's frozen text encoder, which is then fed into a model to perform a task like captioning or VQA. Gaussian noise is added to these text vectors to help address the "modality gap" between text and image vectors in CLIP. Then during testing, images are encoded with CLIP's frozen image encoder and substituted in place of the text vectors, allowing the model to generalize to visual inputs since CLIP's encoders map text and images into a shared semantic space. The method is evaluated by training on textual training data alone for captioning, VQA, visual entailment and visual news tasks, and then testing the model's ability to generalize to images. The results show the text-only trained models achieve scores reasonably close to models trained with images, demonstrating efficient cross-modal transfer.
