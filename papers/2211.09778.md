# [I Can't Believe There's No Images! Learning Visual Tasks Using only   Language Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09778)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether it is possible to learn high-level visual skills, such as parsing questions, comparing semantics, and generating descriptions, by transferring those skills from natural language training data to computer vision tasks without using any visual training data. 

The key hypothesis is that the high-level semantics needed for many vision and language tasks have significant overlap, and therefore models can learn those skills from natural language data and then apply them to visual inputs if both modalities are encoded into a shared semantic space.

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called CLOSE that exploits jointly trained contrastive vision-language models like CLIP to embed visual and textual inputs into a common semantic vector space. It then studies whether models trained on textual training data alone in this space can effectively transfer to visual inputs at test time.

The authors evaluate this cross-modal transfer hypothesis on a range of vision and language tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. Their results generally show a surprisingly small drop in performance compared to models trained with visual data, demonstrating efficient transfer is possible for high-level semantics between vision and language using this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for zero-shot cross-modal transfer learning using contrastive models. Specifically:

- They introduce CLOSE, a method that can train models on textual data alone and then apply them to visual inputs at test time. This allows transferring skills learned from text data to visual tasks. 

- They show CLOSE is effective on a range of vision and language tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, visual entailment, and visual news captioning. The text-only CLOSE models achieve results surprisingly close to models trained directly on images.

- They demonstrate an application of CLOSE for stylistic image captioning by training on diverse text sources like books, web data, and language model generations. This allows captioning in different styles without using any labeled image data.

- They analyze CLOSE's robustness to the "modality gap" between text and image vectors in contrastive models. They show it is insensitive to constant offsets and study more complex adapters to align the modalities.

- Overall, the ability to transfer from text data to visual tasks using contrastive models is shown to be not only achievable, but produce strong results. This could enable training on text data which is often cheaper to collect than visual data.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling zero-shot cross-modal transfer for vision tasks by exploiting contrastive models trained on large amounts of text and image data. The effectiveness of learning complex vision skills purely from text data is demonstrated.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called CLOSE that allows models to learn visual skills like image captioning, visual entailment, and visual question answering using only natural language training data by leveraging contrastively trained visual-language models like CLIP to map images and text into a shared embedding space.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on using contrastive vision-language models for cross-modal transfer learning:

- The main novelty is training models on text data alone and applying them to images, which enables zero-shot cross-modal transfer. This is a relatively new idea that has been explored by a few recent papers such as ESPER Style and TAP-C, but this paper takes it further by testing on more tasks and proposing methods to address the image-text domain shift like Gaussian noise.

- Compared to other zero-shot methods like MAGIC and Socratic Models, this approach achieves much better performance by fine-tuning the model with task-specific text data. It doesn't require the model to work fully zero-shot.

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work on the text-only setting for captioning, visual entailment, and visual news. It advances the capabilities of models trained without images.

- It provides analysis on the image-text domain shift and how different adapters can help address it. This helps explain why the method works and how it could potentially be improved further.

- Compared to other zero-shot multi-modal models, this approach has advantages like working well with smaller language models and allowing task-specific fine-tuning.

- The application to stylistic captioning demonstrates a useful benefit of training on diverse text sources and transferring to images.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the idea of training on text and transferring to images using contrastive models. The analyses and experiments on multiple datasets help validate this approach and the comparisons to other methods demonstrate the state-of-the-art capabilities it can achieve. The proposed techniques help overcome key challenges like the image-text domain shift.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Continue exploring other modalities beyond text and images. The authors suggest their approach could generalize to other contrastive models that connect modalities like videos, audio, point clouds, etc. This could expand the applicability of their method to allow for more kinds of cross-modal transfer.

- Use more powerful contrastive models. The authors show performance improves when using larger contrastive models like OpenCLIP and EVA-CLIP. Developing and applying even more advanced contrastive models could further improve the effectiveness of their approach. 

- Find better methods for choosing or tuning the noise level. The addition of Gaussian noise is important for their approach, but currently simple heuristics are used to set the noise level. More principled methods for selecting the noise could improve results.

- Apply the method to more use cases that leverage its ability to train with only text data. The authors suggest applications like training on text summaries to do video captioning, using textbook data to learn to caption images of procedures, and learning from text to caption new modalities like graphs.

- Further explore the generated stylistic captions. The paper shows promising results on generating stylistic captions from text sources, more work could be done to improve the image relevance and stylistic consistency.

- Continue analyzing differences between text and image embeddings. While the authors provide some analysis, further work to deeply understand the embedding differences could inspire new methods to improve their approach.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the modalities and tasks the method can be applied to, improving various components like the contrastive models and noise modeling, and further analysis to guide improvements. The overall goal is to advance cross-modal transfer to enable more flexible training across data modalities.
