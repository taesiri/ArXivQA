# [Natural Language Reasoning, A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14725)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to perform effective natural language reasoning (NLR)?Specifically, the paper aims to:- Provide a clear definition and taxonomy of natural language reasoning in NLP- Discuss the potentials, challenges, and requirements of using PLMs for NLR- Review the development and empirical evidence showing PLMs' capabilities for NLR- Categorize and compare different methodologies for building NLR systems with PLMs - Survey NLR benchmarks and tasks, analyzing to what extent they require reasoning- Identify limitations of current research and discuss future directionsThe key hypothesis seems to be that PLMs, especially large language models, have significant potential for natural language reasoning due to their abilities in language understanding, capturing implicit knowledge, few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress, methodologies, tasks, and open questions around this hypothesis.

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this survey paper are:1. It provides a distinct definition for natural language reasoning (NLR) in NLP, discussing what tasks require reasoning and introducing a taxonomy of reasoning types. 2. It conducts a comprehensive literature review of NLR methods based on pre-trained language models (PLMs), covering major benchmarks like logical reasoning, natural language inference, multi-hop QA, and commonsense reasoning. The paper categorizes methodologies into end-to-end reasoning, forward reasoning, and backward reasoning. 3. The paper identifies and highlights backward reasoning as a powerful yet under-explored paradigm for multi-step reasoning compared to the more popular forward reasoning. 4. The paper introduces defeasible reasoning (non-deductive reasoning) and discusses its differences from deductive reasoning. It suggests defeasible reasoning as one of the most important future directions for NLR.5. The survey focuses on reasoning with unstructured natural language text using PLMs, excluding neuro-symbolic techniques and mathematical reasoning.In summary, this survey makes conceptual and practical contributions to formalize and advance natural language reasoning research in NLP, especially using pre-trained language models.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of natural language reasoning in NLP, including defining reasoning, discussing why and how PLMs can be leveraged, introducing taxonomies of reasoning tasks and methodologies, reviewing popular benchmarks and recent progress, and suggesting future directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this survey paper on natural language reasoning compares to other related work:- Scope: This paper provides a broad overview of natural language reasoning in NLP, covering key concepts, popular methods, and major benchmark datasets. Other recent surveys tend to focus on a narrower subset, like commonsense reasoning or transformer-based methods. The comprehensive scope is a strength of this paper.- Definitions: The paper makes an effort to clearly define "reasoning" in NLP based on philosophy/logic perspectives and concerns in the field. Other surveys typically just rely on an intuitive understanding of reasoning. Providing distinct definitions is useful for clarifying terminology.- Taxonomy: The paper categorizes reasoning methods into end-to-end, forward, and backward approaches based on the use of reasoning paths. This provides a clear way to distinguish high-level methodologies. Some other surveys focus more on task-specific methods or model architectures. - Backward reasoning: The paper uniquely highlights backward reasoning as an important but under-explored paradigm compared to forward reasoning, especially for reducing search space in multi-step reasoning. Other surveys have not emphasized backward reasoning to the same extent.- Defeasible reasoning: The paper argues defeasible reasoning should be a key focus area going forward, given its prevalence in real-world reasoning. Most prior surveys focus on deductive reasoning capabilities of models.- Interpretability: The paper emphasizes the growing importance of interpretability in reasoning, via explicit reasoning paths. Other surveys are more focused just on predictive accuracy.Overall, the comprehensive scope, attention to definitional clarity, novel taxonomy and themes (backward reasoning, defeasible reasoning, interpretability), help differentiate this survey and provide a clear conceptual framework for understanding progress and open challenges in natural language reasoning research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:1. Generalization to longer reasoning steps: The authors suggest exploring how to better generalize pre-trained language models (PLMs) to perform reasoning over more steps, as performance tends to degrade when models encounter examples requiring more steps than seen during training. Approaches like planning could help deal with the combinatorial explosion.2. More research on defeasible reasoning: The authors highlight the need for more work on non-deductive reasoning like abduction and induction, which are more common in daily life but less explored in NLP compared to deduction. PLMs may offer promise here. 3. Reasoning over diverse languages and modalities: The authors suggest extending reasoning capabilities beyond just English text to other languages and modalities like tables and images.4. Interpretability and faithful reasoning: Producing transparent, reliable reasoning paths becomes important for longer, defeasible reasoning. Approaches to improve interpretability are suggested.5. Eliciting reasoning capabilities via prompting: Finding more prompts that can unlock reasoning abilities in large language models is proposed, building on successes like chain of thought prompting.6. Self-improvement of LLMs: Leveraging LLMs to learn from their own generated reasoning paths is suggested as a way to alleviate the need for reasoning supervision data.7. More exploration of backward reasoning: Backward chaining and question decomposition are highlighted as efficient reasoning methods worth more exploration compared to the popular forward chaining approach.8. Planning for reasoning: The authors suggest more research on planning to deal with the exponential growth of reasoning search spaces.In summary, extending reasoning capabilities, promoting interpretability, and exploiting strengths of LLMs are common themes in the suggested future directions.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new model called ReasonFormer for natural language reasoning. ReasonFormer introduces a set of specialized modules on top of a pretrained BERT model to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, it has three main modules - a Retriever module to retrieve relevant knowledge, an Aligner module to align the retrieved knowledge with the query, and a Reasoner module to perform multi-step reasoning over the aligned knowledge to derive the final prediction. The Retriever module uses dense retrievers to find relevant facts from the provided knowledge source. The Aligner module aligns the retrieved facts with the query using an attention mechanism. The Reasoner module then iteratively performs reasoning over the aligned facts using a recurrent neural network to accumulate evidence and derive the final prediction. By specializing different modules for different reasoning subtasks, ReasonFormer aims to enhance the reasoning capability of vanilla BERT models in an interpretable way without relying too much on handcrafted features or rules.
