# [Galaxy 3D Shape Recovery using Mixture Density Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recovering the intrinsic 3D shape of galaxies is challenging because we only observe their 2D projected shapes. Traditional methods make assumptions linking the kinematic misalignment angle to the 3D shape, but recent works have questioned these assumptions. There is a need for better ways to infer 3D galaxy shapes from observations.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose using a supervised machine learning approach called a mixture density network (MDN) to predict probability distributions for the axis ratios p and q that characterize 3D galaxy shapes. They create a mock observational dataset from the EAGLE simulation with known ground truth shapes to train and test the MDN. The MDN takes as input common photometric (e.g. ellipticity) and kinematic (e.g. angular momentum) parameters measured from integral field spectroscopy.

Key Contributions:

- Demonstrate that no single observational parameter can uniquely determine 3D shape, justifying need for machine learning approach
- Show that combining multiple photometric and kinematic parameters improves shape recovery compared to using just the kinematic misalignment angle
- MDN provides probability distributions for p and q of individual galaxies, along with uncertainty estimates, unlike previous statistical approaches
- MDN performs well for prolate systems but poorer for spherical and some triaxial systems due to limitations modeling the shape distributions  
- Recommend using predictions with low uncertainty (small std dev of Gaussian components). Predictive metrics improve when selecting certain predictions.
- First application of MDN for 3D galaxy shape recovery. Sets foundation for using machine learning techniques with IFS surveys.

In summary, the authors present a proof-of-concept for using machine learning to estimate 3D galaxy shapes and uncertainties from 2D observations. Key advantages over previous methods are demonstrated. Limitations and recommendations for applying this approach are also discussed.
