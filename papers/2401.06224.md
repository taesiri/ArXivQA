## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a 3D vessel segmentation approach using frequency domain learning and Fourier fusion to enhance network fitting of vascular shapes and reduce computational expenses while preserving global receptive fields.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a 3D segmentation approach using frequency domain learning to enhance network fitting of vascular shapes by introducing global receptive fields. Specifically:

1) The paper leverages Fourier domain learning as a substitute for multi-scale convolutional kernels in 3D hierarchical segmentation models, which can reduce computational expenses while preserving global receptive fields within the network compared to attention mechanisms. 

2) The paper designs a zero-parameter frequency domain fusion method to improve the skip connections in U-Net architecture. This facilitates preserving high-frequency edge features from the encoder and low-frequency semantic features from the decoder.

3) Extensive experiments show the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two coronary vessel datasets while substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising global receptive fields.

In summary, the core contribution is using frequency domain learning to achieve efficient and accurate 3D vessel segmentation with global receptive fields. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
