# [Trajectory Estimation in Unknown Nonlinear Manifold Using Koopman   Operator Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of formation coordination for a swarm of robots moving on an unknown, nonlinear 2D Riemannian manifold. 
- Maintaining a desired formation shape is challenging since the manifold is unknown and followers only have access to local information from leaders.
- The problem is reframed as a trajectory estimation problem for individual follower robots to determine where to move next to maintain formation.

Proposed Solution:
- Uses a leader-follower framework where leaders provide reference trajectory and followers estimate their movement to maintain constraints.
- Leverages Koopman operator theory and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for data-driven estimation of follower trajectories.  
- The EDMD algorithm approximates the Koopman operator from streaming measurement data to linearly evolve nonlinear dynamics one timestep ahead.
- Various sensor measurement dictionaries are tested, with relative position between leaders and followers performing the best.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a decentralized formation coordination method suitable for swarms robots with local sensing and communication.
- Reframes the problem as a trajectory estimation challenge using Koopman theory.
- Proposes a streaming EDMD algorithm that uses measurement dictionaries to approximate Koopman operator.
- Determines relative position is most suitable dictionary for accurate trajectory estimation.  
- Demonstrates and evaluates the approach effectiveness across manifold types and measurement dictionaries through simulations.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of Koopman operator theory and streaming EDMD algorithm to estimate individual follower trajectories for formation coordination of robot swarms on unknown nonlinear manifolds using only local information. The efficacy of this data-driven dynamical systems approach is shown through detailed simulations.
