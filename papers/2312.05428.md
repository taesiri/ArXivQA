# [Trajectory Estimation in Unknown Nonlinear Manifold Using Koopman   Operator Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of formation coordination for a swarm of robots moving on an unknown, nonlinear 2D Riemannian manifold. 
- Maintaining a desired formation shape is challenging since the manifold is unknown and followers only have access to local information from leaders.
- The problem is reframed as a trajectory estimation problem for individual follower robots to determine where to move next to maintain formation.

Proposed Solution:
- Uses a leader-follower framework where leaders provide reference trajectory and followers estimate their movement to maintain constraints.
- Leverages Koopman operator theory and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for data-driven estimation of follower trajectories.  
- The EDMD algorithm approximates the Koopman operator from streaming measurement data to linearly evolve nonlinear dynamics one timestep ahead.
- Various sensor measurement dictionaries are tested, with relative position between leaders and followers performing the best.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a decentralized formation coordination method suitable for swarms robots with local sensing and communication.
- Reframes the problem as a trajectory estimation challenge using Koopman theory.
- Proposes a streaming EDMD algorithm that uses measurement dictionaries to approximate Koopman operator.
- Determines relative position is most suitable dictionary for accurate trajectory estimation.  
- Demonstrates and evaluates the approach effectiveness across manifold types and measurement dictionaries through simulations.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of Koopman operator theory and streaming EDMD algorithm to estimate individual follower trajectories for formation coordination of robot swarms on unknown nonlinear manifolds using only local information. The efficacy of this data-driven dynamical systems approach is shown through detailed simulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a leader-follower trajectory estimation algorithm using Koopman operator theory and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition to achieve formation coordination of a swarm traveling on an unknown nonlinear manifold.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a leader-follower trajectory estimation algorithm using Koopman operator theory and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for swarm formation coordination on unknown nonlinear manifolds. Specifically:

- The paper frames the swarm formation coordination problem as a trajectory estimation problem for individual follower agents. This allows the use of methods like EDMD to guide the followers' motion and maintain the desired formation.

- The proposed algorithm leverages EDMD, which is a data-driven method to approximate the Koopman operator, to estimate the future positions of the followers using past measurement data. This allows the followers to anticipate the ideal positions set by the leaders and adjust their motion accordingly.

- Through simulations on manifolds of different curvature, the algorithm is shown to effectively reduce the sensing range required for the followers to reach the ideal positions set by the leader extensions.

- Analysis is provided on suitable choices of measurement functions (dictionaries) to use with EDMD that rely only on local information available to the followers, rather than global state information. This makes the approach practical for decentralized swarm coordination.

In summary, the key contribution is a decentralized swarm coordination algorithm that reframes the problem as trajectory estimation for followers, and provides them guidance using EDMD with local measurement functions as inputs. The approach is shown to be effective across different types of unknown, nonlinear manifolds.

The paper focuses on the problem of formation coordination for a swarm of robots moving on an unknown Riemannian manifold surface. It specifically looks at a leader-follower framework and reformulates the coordination problem as a trajectory estimation task for the followers, using concepts from Koopman operator theory and EDMD. Key ideas include representing the follower motions as nonlinear dynamic systems, using measurement dictionaries to approximate the Koopman operator in a data-driven way, and adapting the method in a streaming fashion as new data becomes available.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes Koopman operator theory and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to estimate follower trajectories for formation coordination. Why was this approach selected over other data-driven methods for identifying nonlinear dynamics (e.g. neural networks)? What are the advantages and limitations?

2. EDMD relies on the choice of dictionary/measurement functions to approximate the Koopman operator. What considerations went into selecting relative position and follower velocity as the dictionary terms? How sensitive is the method to this choice?

3. The method assumes sparse communication between leaders and followers. How does the frequency of communication impact the accuracy of trajectory estimation? Is there an optimal balance between communication frequency and estimation error? 

4. How does the curvature of the manifold impact the performance of the proposed approach? Are there cases where the method would break down or have substantially degraded performance?

5. The simulations consider noise-free velocity data for the follower. How do practical realities like noisy velocity measurements impact the accuracy of trajectory estimation? How could the method account for uncertainties in velocity?

6. The method relies solely on local information available to individual followers. Could incorporating non-local data (e.g. positions of distant agents) improve estimation accuracy? What modifications would be needed?

7. The study analyzes performance across broad manifold categories, but how well does the method generalize to completely novel manifolds not represented in the training data?

8. The EDMD model needs to adapt to new measurements. How is old/irrelevant training data handled? Are there optimal strategies for selecting which data to retain versus replace? 

9. For practical implementation, how could the method account for unmodeled effects like external disturbances, wheel slip, etc? Would explicitly modeling uncertainties improve robustness?

10. The method estimates one-step ahead trajectories. How could the ideas be extended for longer horizon trajectory forecasting? Are there limitations to prediction horizon for this technique?
