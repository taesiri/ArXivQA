# [Unbiased Filtering Of Accidental Clicks in Verizon Media Native   Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05017)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new approach to deal with the problem of accidental clicks (ACs) in online advertising. ACs provide no useful user intent information but lead to inaccurate click-through rate (CTR) prediction models that hurt revenues. The proposed solution filters out ACs from the CTR model training set and spreads their positive weight to negative events (skips) based on an auxiliary AC prediction model. This allows removing ACs while keeping an unbiased CTR model. Specifically, they use a modified Offset algorithm with non-binary labels from the AC model and cross-entropy loss to train the CTR model. Offline evaluation shows improved prediction accuracy, while online testing yielded a 1.18% revenue lift over the baseline. The benefits include more accurate and unbiased CTR predictions, lightweight resource requirements, and no changes needed to the existing serving system. Future work may focus on improving the AC model and using segmented thresholds. Overall, this is the first successful system reported for web-scale AC handling without negatively impacting revenues or system performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel approach to filter out accidental clicks in online advertising by spreading their positive weight across negative events using predictions from an auxiliary accidental click prediction model, leading to improved click-through rate prediction accuracy and increased revenue.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Conducting a large scale analysis of click dwell-time that provides insights and supports various design decisions.

2. Presenting a novel unbiased accidental click (AC) filtering approach to deal with the AC problem. The solution alters the click prediction model training and requires no changes in other system components. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first report of a successful AC aware web scale advertising system.

3. Performance evaluation in both offline and online settings, demonstrating a revenue lift of 1.18% over the AC agnostic production system.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a new unbiased approach to filter out accidental clicks when training click prediction models, while maintaining calibration. This approach is evaluated to show improved accuracy and revenue lift.

The paper focuses on dealing with the issue of accidental clicks in native advertising by users, which provide no useful signals of user intent or interest. It proposes a modified Offset algorithm to filter out accidental clicks in a way that improves click prediction accuracy without negatively biasing the click through rate predictions. Performance is evaluated on real Yahoo/Verizon Media native advertising traffic.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using dwell time to classify clicks as accidental or intentional. What other signals could potentially be used to make this classification more accurate? For example, mouse movements, scroll depth, etc.

2. The accidental click (AC) prediction model uses a limited set of features like user involvement, device type, etc. What other user or context features could help improve the accuracy of identifying accidental clicks?

3. The paper sets a global threshold of 3 seconds for classifying clicks as accidental. Would using personalized dwell time thresholds per user or context provide better results? What experiments could be done to test this?

4. What adjustments would need to be made to the proposed method if instead of removing accidental clicks entirely, the goal was to downweight them during model training?

5. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to the choice of threshold for defining accidental clicks? What experiments could be done to characterize this sensitivity? 

6. The paper mentions using a "thin" model for AC prediction to conserve resources. How much do the size and capacity of this model impact the overall performance? What analysis could be done to find the right balance?

7. What other loss functions could be used instead of binary cross-entropy for the modified click model? Would optimizing something like squared error provide different results?

8. How does the relative frequency of accidental clicks in the training data impact the effectiveness of the proposed method? Are there any failure cases or limitations?

9. The online evaluation shows a 1.18% lift in revenue. What other online metrics could be tracked to better evaluate real-world effectiveness? 

10. How well would this method work for other prediction tasks like conversion rate prediction? What modifications would need to be made?
