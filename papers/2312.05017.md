# [Unbiased Filtering Of Accidental Clicks in Verizon Media Native   Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05017)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new approach to deal with the problem of accidental clicks (ACs) in online advertising. ACs provide no useful user intent information but lead to inaccurate click-through rate (CTR) prediction models that hurt revenues. The proposed solution filters out ACs from the CTR model training set and spreads their positive weight to negative events (skips) based on an auxiliary AC prediction model. This allows removing ACs while keeping an unbiased CTR model. Specifically, they use a modified Offset algorithm with non-binary labels from the AC model and cross-entropy loss to train the CTR model. Offline evaluation shows improved prediction accuracy, while online testing yielded a 1.18% revenue lift over the baseline. The benefits include more accurate and unbiased CTR predictions, lightweight resource requirements, and no changes needed to the existing serving system. Future work may focus on improving the AC model and using segmented thresholds. Overall, this is the first successful system reported for web-scale AC handling without negatively impacting revenues or system performance.
