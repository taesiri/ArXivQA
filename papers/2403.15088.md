# [CHisIEC: An Information Extraction Corpus for Ancient Chinese History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Information extraction (IE) from ancient Chinese historical documents is challenging due to the long time span covered (over 1,800 years) and linguistic heterogeneity. 
- Existing datasets for IE from ancient Chinese texts are small in size, limiting the development of deep learning models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a large-scale information extraction dataset called CHisIEC based on historical books from 13 Chinese dynasties.
- The dataset contains over 130K characters, with detailed annotations for named entities (14K entities) and relations (8.6K relations). 
- Four entity types (person, location, official, book) and 12 relation types are defined, spanning political, military, geographic, family, and personal domains.

Key Contributions:
- CHisIEC is the largest manually annotated IE dataset for ancient Chinese spanning over 1,830 years.
- Comprehensive experiments are conducted using models of different sizes and paradigms to validate the dataset.
- Analysis shows pre-trained language models achieve the best performance. Large models also demonstrate competitive results, especially in relation extraction.
- The linguistic analysis highlights the temporal range, text heterogeneity, and information density of CHisIEC.
- The dataset advances information extraction for the digital humanities field of Chinese history and cultural heritage preservation.

In summary, the paper introduces a large-scale, specialized information extraction dataset for ancient Chinese documents that can facilitate deep learning research by providing sufficient annotated data covering a vast historical time span. Extensive experiments verify the utility of the corpus.
