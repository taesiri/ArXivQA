# [Implicit Feedback for Dense Passage Retrieval: A Counterfactual Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00718)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can implicit feedback (specifically clicks) from historic search logs be exploited to improve the effectiveness of dense retrievers (DRs)?The key hypotheses investigated are:1) Implicit feedback such as historic clicks can provide a valuable signal to improve dense retrievers, if an appropriate aggregation mechanism is used.2) Biases in the implicit feedback, especially position bias in clicks, can negatively affect the effectiveness of methods that exploit this signal. Counterfactual debiasing techniques can be adapted to mitigate this.3) The aggregation technique needs to be extended using approximate nearest neighbor search to deal with queries not present in the historic logs.The paper introduces Counterfactual Rocchio (CoRocchio) to exploit historic click logs to improve DRs. It shows theoretically and empirically that CoRocchio can effectively leverage the implicit feedback, while counterfactually removing position and other biases that can negatively affect effectiveness. It also proposes CoRocchio-ANN to deal with unseen queries.In summary, the central research question is on understanding how to effectively exploit historic implicit feedback for improving dense retrievers, which requires dealing with noise and biases and generalizing to unseen queries. The key hypothesis is that counterfactual debiasing techniques adapted to this context can allow historic implicit feedback to improve DRs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a counterfactual method called Counterfactual Rocchio (CoRocchio) to exploit implicit feedback such as clicks from historic logs to improve the effectiveness of dense retrievers (DRs). The key ideas and contributions are:- Adapting pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) methods for DRs to deal with implicit feedback instead of pseudo relevance. This involves replacing the assumption that top ranked documents are relevant (as in PRF) with the assumption that clicked documents are relevant (implicit feedback).- Addressing three key challenges when exploiting implicit feedback for DRs: 1) Lack of datasets with click data by simulating clicks using click models.2) Presence of bias like position bias in clicks by proposing CoRocchio which uses inverse propensity scoring to debias the click signal.3) Generalizing to unseen queries by using nearest neighbor search to find related queries in the log.- Demonstrating theoretically and empirically that CoRocchio produces unbiased query representations by counterfactually debiasing biased click signals.- Showing that exploiting historic click logs with CoRocchio significantly improves search effectiveness of DRs like ANCE and TCT-ColBERTv2.- Releasing code and datasets to support further research in this direction.In summary, the main contribution is developing the counterfactual CoRocchio method to effectively exploit biased implicit feedback from historic logs to improve dense retrievers.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel method for exploiting implicit feedback (specifically click data) to improve dense passage retrievers (DRs). Here is how it compares to related work:- It is the first work to investigate using implicit feedback for DRs. Most prior work on improving DRs has focused on training methods or integrating pseudo relevance feedback. - The idea of adapting pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) methods to use implicit feedback shares similarities with prior work adapting PRF for DRs. However, a key difference is this paper uses historic/past click data, rather than feedback on an initial retrieval for the current query.- The proposal to use counterfactual learning to remove biases in the click signal connects to a large body of work in counterfactual and online learning to rank. However, these techniques have not been previously explored for DRs.- The techniques to simulate user clicks and generate augmented queries for evaluation borrow from prior practices in online/counterfactual LTR research. But they have not been previously used to create datasets for DR evaluation.- For unseen queries, using approximate nearest neighbors is a simple but novel approach in this context. The idea of using related historic queries is inspired by work on tabular learning to rank models.Overall, this paper makes several innovative adaptations of existing techniques to the novel problem of using implicit feedback to improve DRs. The experiments demonstrate these methods are effective for DRs and robust to noise/bias in the clicks. This opens up a promising new research direction for further enhancing DRs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing techniques to estimate user observation propensities from historical click logs. The authors' proposed CoRocchio method relies on knowing user propensities for counterfactual debiasing, but regard propensity estimation as outside the scope of their work. They suggest exploring recent techniques for propensity estimation as future work.- Integrating negative implicit feedback signals into CoRocchio. The authors focused only on using clicked passages as positive feedback. They suggest exploring techniques to de-bias unclicked passages as negative feedback to further improve CoRocchio.- Applying CoRocchio to other types of dense retrievers beyond ANCE and TCT-ColBERTv2. The authors propose CoRocchio as a general framework that could be applied to other dense retrievers. Empirically evaluating this on other models is suggested.- Exploring the use of other types of implicit feedback beyond clicks for dense retrievers, such as dwell time, mouse movements, etc. The authors focused solely on click signals but suggest expanding the notion of implicit feedback more broadly.- Developing online learning methods to continuously update dense retrievers as new implicit feedback is gathered. The authors propose a batch approach using historic logs, but suggest an online learning approach could be more desirable.- Applying the proposed techniques to other IR tasks beyond passage retrieval, such as document ranking. The evaluation is limited to passage ranking datasets, but the techniques could generalize.- Conducting user studies to evaluate the real-world usefulness of the proposed techniques with human searchers. The current evaluation is simulation-based, so validating the effectiveness gains with real users is an important next step.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a counterfactual Rocchio (CoRocchio) method to exploit implicit feedback from historic click logs to improve dense retrievers (DRs). The method adapts pseudo-relevance feedback techniques used with DRs to leverage click signals instead. It faces three key challenges: (1) lack of click data in existing DR training sets, addressed by simulating clicks; (2) bias in click signals, addressed by a counterfactual technique to debias clicks; (3) requirement that the current query appears in the log, addressed by using approximate nearest neighbors to find related queries. Experiments on TREC DL datasets demonstrate CoRocchio effectively exploits clicks to improve two DRs. Noise and bias in clicks hurt effectiveness but CoRocchio counters this. Overall, the method significantly improves DR search effectiveness on seen queries in historic logs and, via nearest neighbors, unseen queries.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method called Counterfactual Rocchio (CoRocchio) to improve the effectiveness of Dense Retrieval (DR) models by exploiting implicit feedback from historic click logs. The key idea is to adapt pseudo relevance feedback techniques for DRs to leverage clicks rather than top ranked passages as the signal of relevance. The authors identify three main challenges. First, standard DR datasets lack clicks, so they simulate clicks using models. Second, clicks exhibit bias which harms effectiveness, so they theoretically and empirically demonstrate a debiasing method. Third, most queries are unseen, so they extend their method using approximate nearest neighbors. Experiments on TREC DL datasets under different simulated user conditions show that both their proposed Rocchio and CoRocchio methods significantly improve DRs like ANCE and ColBERT. The debiasing of CoRocchio is shown to be important, especially as click bias increases. The method also generalizes to unseen queries by aggregating signals from related queries in the log. Overall, this is the first work to investigate incorporating historic click logs as implicit feedback into Dense Retrievers and shows promising results.In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:1) Proposes Rocchio and CoRocchio methods to exploit click logs as implicit feedback for improving Dense Retrievers. 2) Identifies key challenges with lacking clicks, bias, and unseen queries.3) Provides solutions including click simulation, debiasing, and nearest neighbors.4) Demonstrates significant improvements over baselines under different conditions.5) Lays the groundwork for incorporating implicit feedback into Dense Retrieval.
