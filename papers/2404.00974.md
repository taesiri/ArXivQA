# [Improving Visual Recognition with Hyperbolical Visual Hierarchy Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the hierarchical organization of visual scenes is crucial for recognizing complex relations of visual elements and comprehensive scene understanding. 
- Recent vision transformers lack the ability to represent the asymmetric hierarchical relations between image tokens. They rely on symmetric similarity measurements which are suboptimal.  
- Representing hierarchies in Euclidean space leads to distortions in semantic distances due to its flat geometry.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Visual Hierarchy Mapper (Hi-Mapper) module that can enhance the structured understanding of any pre-trained deep neural network by identifying the visual hierarchy.

- Hi-Mapper first constructs a hierarchy tree where nodes are modeled as probability distributions. Relations are defined through inclusion of densities.

- It interacts with the penultimate visual feature map of a DNN to decompose it into a visual hierarchy. This is done by aggregating semantically relevant features to their closest semantic clusters.

- The identified visual hierarchy is mapped to hyperbolic space where a novel hierarchical contrastive loss is used to optimize the hierarchical relations. This loss encourages child-parent similarity and child-child dissimilarity.  

- The optimized visual hierarchy is encoded back into the global visual representation of the DNN to get an enhanced representation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel probabilistic modeling of hierarchy tree to capture asymmetric relations.

- Identification of visual hierarchy from any DNN without need for part annotations.

- Learning hierarchical relations in hyperbolic space through a tailored contrastive loss.

- Serving as a plug-and-play module that generalizes over any pre-trained DNN architecture.

- Consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art on image classification and dense prediction tasks.
