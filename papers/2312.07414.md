# [QSMVM: QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for   video-streaming services over MANETs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07414)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol called QSMVM for providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The goal is to leverage social tie strength information between users along with traditional QoS metrics like packet loss and delay to select optimal forwarding paths. The motivation is to balance the tradeoff between QoS performance and trust/confidence level of the intermediate nodes. The tie strength metric quantifies the interaction level between users in a social network. Simulation results across varied node densities and social interaction levels demonstrate how adjusting the tie strength weight impacts the percentage packet loss and delay. In high node density and social interaction scenarios, incorporating social awareness provides minor QoS benefit but significantly improves average tie strength of the path to over 2.8. The findings show the protocol is adaptive based on node topology and social dynamics to optimize both QoS and user trust. Key conclusions are that jointly considering QoS and social metrics provides flexibility for path selection based on application requirements.
