# [QSMVM: QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for   video-streaming services over MANETs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07414)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol called QSMVM for providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The goal is to leverage social tie strength information between users along with traditional QoS metrics like packet loss and delay to select optimal forwarding paths. The motivation is to balance the tradeoff between QoS performance and trust/confidence level of the intermediate nodes. The tie strength metric quantifies the interaction level between users in a social network. Simulation results across varied node densities and social interaction levels demonstrate how adjusting the tie strength weight impacts the percentage packet loss and delay. In high node density and social interaction scenarios, incorporating social awareness provides minor QoS benefit but significantly improves average tie strength of the path to over 2.8. The findings show the protocol is adaptive based on node topology and social dynamics to optimize both QoS and user trust. Key conclusions are that jointly considering QoS and social metrics provides flexibility for path selection based on application requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new routing protocol named QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol (QSMVM) that considers both quality of service metrics and social tie strength between users to balance performance and trust when providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new routing protocol named "QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for video-streaming services over MANETs (QSMVM)". The key ideas are:

1) The routing protocol considers both quality of service (QoS) metrics like packet loss, delay etc. as well as a social metric called "tie strength" (TS) that measures the strength of relationship between users, in selecting routing paths for video streaming. 

2) By considering TS along with QoS metrics, the goal is to select paths through trusted nodes (high TS) while still meeting the QoS requirements needed for good video quality. This provides a tradeoff between QoS and trustworthiness of the forwarding nodes.

3) The paper presents simulations that analyze the performance of the proposed routing protocol under different network densities and social interaction levels. It studies the impact of varying the weights given to QoS vs TS on metrics like packet loss, delay and average TS of selected paths.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a socially-aware, QoS-based routing protocol for supporting video streaming over MANETs. The joint consideration of QoS and social metrics is the novel part.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called "tie strength" (TS) to measure the social interaction and trust between nodes in a mobile adhoc network (MANET). How is TS quantitatively defined and calculated between two nodes? What is the range of TS values?

2. The paper claims TS can help increase trust and confidence between communicating nodes in a MANET. How specifically would incorporating TS values into the routing algorithm help improve security or prevent attacks? 

3. The proposed QSMVM routing algorithm uses a multimetric score to select forwarding paths. Explain the different components and weights that make up this score. How does adjusting the TS weight $w_{TS}$ impact the tradeoff between QoS and social confidence?

4. What statistical distribution is used to model the tie strength values between node pairs in the simulation experiments? How do the mean and standard deviation parameters of this distribution affect the performance results as $w_{TS}$ is varied?  

5. How does node density in the network impact both QoS performance and the effectiveness of using the TS metric in the routing decisions? Explain the differences noticed between the 100 vs 200 nodes/km^2 scenarios.

6. For the high node density and high average TS case, the best performance occurs when only QoS metrics are used ($w_{TS}=0$). Why does the TS metric provide little additional benefit in this scenario?

7. The paper analyzes adjusting $w_{TS}$ from 0 to 1. What are the practical implications of the two extremes of $w_{TS}=0$ (only QoS) and $w_{TS}=1$ (only TS)? What would you choose for an actual deployment?

8. The simulations show that packet loss rate increases but delay stays relatively constant as $w_{TS}$ increases. Explain possible reasons for why one metric is impacted more than the other metric.

9. How frequently does the protocol re-calculate available paths and select a new forwarding path based on dynamic network conditions? How could the path update rate be optimized?

10. The paper sets the QoS weights ($w_{BW}, w_{L}, etc.$) equally in computing the multi-metric score. How would using unequal weights for certain QoS metrics like loss or delay impact the performance and path decisions?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). MANETs face challenges like dynamic topology changes and limited network resources. The paper argues that utilizing social information like interactions among users in online social networks could help design better routing protocols that balance quality of service (QoS) and trust between forwarding nodes.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a QoS and social-aware routing protocol called QSMVM to provide video streaming over MANETs. QSMVM modifies an existing QoS-aware multipath routing protocol called MMDSR by incorporating a new "tie strength" (TS) metric that quantifies the social interaction between nodes. TS ranges from 0 to 4, with 4 denoting strongest ties. 

QSMVM computes a multi-metric score for each path combining QoS metrics like delay, losses etc. and average TS of the path. The best path is chosen based on tunable weights given to QoS vs TS. As TS weight increases, preference is given to paths with higher trust between nodes compared to best QoS.

Simulations compare performance for different TS distribution scenarios modeling varying social interaction levels. Effects of changing TS weight on metrics like losses, delay and average TS of selected path are analyzed to find optimal operating points.


Main Contributions:

- Proposes socially-aware routing for video streaming over MANETs by using social interaction information like tie strength

- Introduces TS metric to quantify trust between nodes, modifies existing MMDSR protocol to get QSMVM protocol that balances QoS and social awareness 

- Evaluates via simulations - analyses impact of tuning TS weight on QoS metrics and path trust to find optimal trade-off operating points across varying user social interaction scenarios

- Demonstrates QoS and trusted path selection improving applicability for video streaming applications

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed socially-aware routing solution QSMVM, its incorporation of the new TS metric, and highlights the performance evaluation and key contributions around balancing QoS and path trust.

The paper proposes a new routing protocol for video streaming over mobile ad hoc networks that considers both quality of service metrics and a social metric called tie strength to select paths that balance performance and trust between forwarding nodes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new routing protocol named "QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for video-streaming services over MANETs (QSMVM)" that considers both quality of service (QoS) parameters as well as a social metric called "tie strength" (TS) to select the best path to forward video frames in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Including a social metric called "tie strength" (TS), which measures the interaction/trust between pairs of users, along with traditional QoS metrics like packet loss, delay, etc. to compute a multimetric score to select the best forwarding path. This allows balancing between QoS and trust of the path.

2) Analyzing via simulations the tradeoff between QoS parameters (packet loss, delay) and average TS of the selected path as the weight given to TS ($w_{TS}$) is varied. This helps determine a good value of $w_{TS}$ that balances QoS and trust.

3) Evaluating the proposed protocol QSMVM under different node densities and social interaction levels among users. Results show benefits in terms of improving QoS as well as trust of the forwarding path, especially for high node densities with high social interaction.

In summary, jointly considering QoS and social metrics for routing video traffic over MANETs, and analyzing the tradeoff between them is the main contribution. The proposed QSMVM protocol and its evaluations demonstrate this.
