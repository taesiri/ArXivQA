# [QSMVM: QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for   video-streaming services over MANETs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07414)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol called QSMVM for providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The goal is to leverage social tie strength information between users along with traditional QoS metrics like packet loss and delay to select optimal forwarding paths. The motivation is to balance the tradeoff between QoS performance and trust/confidence level of the intermediate nodes. The tie strength metric quantifies the interaction level between users in a social network. Simulation results across varied node densities and social interaction levels demonstrate how adjusting the tie strength weight impacts the percentage packet loss and delay. In high node density and social interaction scenarios, incorporating social awareness provides minor QoS benefit but significantly improves average tie strength of the path to over 2.8. The findings show the protocol is adaptive based on node topology and social dynamics to optimize both QoS and user trust. Key conclusions are that jointly considering QoS and social metrics provides flexibility for path selection based on application requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new routing protocol named QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol (QSMVM) that considers both quality of service metrics and social tie strength between users to balance performance and trust when providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new routing protocol named "QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for video-streaming services over MANETs (QSMVM)". The key ideas are:

1) The routing protocol considers both quality of service (QoS) metrics like packet loss, delay etc. as well as a social metric called "tie strength" (TS) that measures the strength of relationship between users, in selecting routing paths for video streaming. 

2) By considering TS along with QoS metrics, the goal is to select paths through trusted nodes (high TS) while still meeting the QoS requirements needed for good video quality. This provides a tradeoff between QoS and trustworthiness of the forwarding nodes.

3) The paper presents simulations that analyze the performance of the proposed routing protocol under different network densities and social interaction levels. It studies the impact of varying the weights given to QoS vs TS on metrics like packet loss, delay and average TS of selected paths.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a socially-aware, QoS-based routing protocol for supporting video streaming over MANETs. The joint consideration of QoS and social metrics is the novel part.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called "tie strength" (TS) to measure the social interaction and trust between nodes in a mobile adhoc network (MANET). How is TS quantitatively defined and calculated between two nodes? What is the range of TS values?

2. The paper claims TS can help increase trust and confidence between communicating nodes in a MANET. How specifically would incorporating TS values into the routing algorithm help improve security or prevent attacks? 

3. The proposed QSMVM routing algorithm uses a multimetric score to select forwarding paths. Explain the different components and weights that make up this score. How does adjusting the TS weight $w_{TS}$ impact the tradeoff between QoS and social confidence?

4. What statistical distribution is used to model the tie strength values between node pairs in the simulation experiments? How do the mean and standard deviation parameters of this distribution affect the performance results as $w_{TS}$ is varied?  

5. How does node density in the network impact both QoS performance and the effectiveness of using the TS metric in the routing decisions? Explain the differences noticed between the 100 vs 200 nodes/km^2 scenarios.

6. For the high node density and high average TS case, the best performance occurs when only QoS metrics are used ($w_{TS}=0$). Why does the TS metric provide little additional benefit in this scenario?

7. The paper analyzes adjusting $w_{TS}$ from 0 to 1. What are the practical implications of the two extremes of $w_{TS}=0$ (only QoS) and $w_{TS}=1$ (only TS)? What would you choose for an actual deployment?

8. The simulations show that packet loss rate increases but delay stays relatively constant as $w_{TS}$ increases. Explain possible reasons for why one metric is impacted more than the other metric.

9. How frequently does the protocol re-calculate available paths and select a new forwarding path based on dynamic network conditions? How could the path update rate be optimized?

10. The paper sets the QoS weights ($w_{BW}, w_{L}, etc.$) equally in computing the multi-metric score. How would using unequal weights for certain QoS metrics like loss or delay impact the performance and path decisions?
