# [QSMVM: QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for   video-streaming services over MANETs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of providing video streaming services over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). MANETs face challenges like dynamic topology changes and limited network resources. The paper argues that utilizing social information like interactions among users in online social networks could help design better routing protocols that balance quality of service (QoS) and trust between forwarding nodes.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a QoS and social-aware routing protocol called QSMVM to provide video streaming over MANETs. QSMVM modifies an existing QoS-aware multipath routing protocol called MMDSR by incorporating a new "tie strength" (TS) metric that quantifies the social interaction between nodes. TS ranges from 0 to 4, with 4 denoting strongest ties. 

QSMVM computes a multi-metric score for each path combining QoS metrics like delay, losses etc. and average TS of the path. The best path is chosen based on tunable weights given to QoS vs TS. As TS weight increases, preference is given to paths with higher trust between nodes compared to best QoS.

Simulations compare performance for different TS distribution scenarios modeling varying social interaction levels. Effects of changing TS weight on metrics like losses, delay and average TS of selected path are analyzed to find optimal operating points.


Main Contributions:

- Proposes socially-aware routing for video streaming over MANETs by using social interaction information like tie strength

- Introduces TS metric to quantify trust between nodes, modifies existing MMDSR protocol to get QSMVM protocol that balances QoS and social awareness 

- Evaluates via simulations - analyses impact of tuning TS weight on QoS metrics and path trust to find optimal trade-off operating points across varying user social interaction scenarios

- Demonstrates QoS and trusted path selection improving applicability for video streaming applications

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed socially-aware routing solution QSMVM, its incorporation of the new TS metric, and highlights the performance evaluation and key contributions around balancing QoS and path trust.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new routing protocol for video streaming over mobile ad hoc networks that considers both quality of service metrics and a social metric called tie strength to select paths that balance performance and trust between forwarding nodes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new routing protocol named "QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for video-streaming services over MANETs (QSMVM)" that considers both quality of service (QoS) parameters as well as a social metric called "tie strength" (TS) to select the best path to forward video frames in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Including a social metric called "tie strength" (TS), which measures the interaction/trust between pairs of users, along with traditional QoS metrics like packet loss, delay, etc. to compute a multimetric score to select the best forwarding path. This allows balancing between QoS and trust of the path.

2) Analyzing via simulations the tradeoff between QoS parameters (packet loss, delay) and average TS of the selected path as the weight given to TS ($w_{TS}$) is varied. This helps determine a good value of $w_{TS}$ that balances QoS and trust.

3) Evaluating the proposed protocol QSMVM under different node densities and social interaction levels among users. Results show benefits in terms of improving QoS as well as trust of the forwarding path, especially for high node densities with high social interaction.

In summary, jointly considering QoS and social metrics for routing video traffic over MANETs, and analyzing the tradeoff between them is the main contribution. The proposed QSMVM protocol and its evaluations demonstrate this.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new routing protocol named QSMVM that considers both QoS metrics and a social metric called tie strength (TS). What is the motivation behind using TS to select forwarding paths? How could using TS help improve routing decisions?

2. Explain in detail how tie strength (TS) is calculated between two users in this paper. What parameters and equations are used? How is the TS index made dynamic over time?

3. The paper assigns an integer TS value between 0-4 to quantify the tie strength between two users. Explain the rationale behind using a scale of 0-4. What do the different numeric values represent about the strength of social ties? 

4. In the paper's proposed method, explain what the multimetric score $MScore_k^i$ in Eq. (8) represents. What are the weights $w_{QoS}$ and $w_{TS}$ balancing in this equation? 

5. The tuning function in Eq. (4) is used to dynamically adjust the routing protocol's refreshing period based on a network state parameter. Explain the intuition behind the form of this tuning function and how it allows adaptive self-configuration.  

6. What were the different simulation scenarios used to evaluate the method? Explain the reasoning behind the choice of normal distribution parameters used to model tie strength values.

7. Analyze the trade-offs observed in the results between packet losses, packet delay, and average tie strength of selected forwarding paths as the $w_{TS}$ weight varies. When does increasing $w_{TS}$ start to negatively impact QoS?

8. Compare how the performance of the proposed QSMVM routing method differs in simulations with 100 vs. 200 nodes/km^2 densities. What trends can be observed?

9. The paper argues the method could help address security issues in MANETs. Explain this argument and discuss how routing based on social tie strength could potentially improve security.  

10. Suggest some ways the proposed routing method could be extended or improved in future work, based on its limitations and the paper's conclusions.
