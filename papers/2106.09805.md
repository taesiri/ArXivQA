# [Shuffle Private Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09805)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces sequentially interactive and fully interactive variants of the shuffle model of differential privacy. This allows protocols that interact with users across multiple rounds, in contrast to standard one-shot shuffle protocols.2. It provides a new shuffle-private protocol for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm sensitivity. This is done by using multiple messages per user and a variant of advanced composition tailored to the protocol's instance-specific privacy guarantee. 3. It leverages the vector summation protocol to develop several new utility guarantees for shuffle-private stochastic convex optimization. These include guarantees for non-smooth, smooth, and strongly convex losses in both the sequentially and fully interactive models. The guarantees improve on prior locally private results and match centralized differential privacy in the full interactivity setting.So in summary, the main research contributions are introducing new interactive variants of the shuffle model, providing protocols for private vector summation and convex optimization in these models, and analyzing the attainable utility guarantees. The central hypothesis seems to be that allowing multiple rounds of interaction will enable better utility guarantees for private learning tasks like stochastic convex optimization. The paper proves this via the concrete vector summation and optimization protocols proposed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces sequentially interactive and fully interactive variants of the shuffle model of differential privacy. This distinguishes protocols based on whether users participate in one round or multiple rounds. 2. It provides a new shuffle private protocol for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm. This uses multiple messages per user to obtain better accuracy than prior work.3. It applies the vector summation protocol to obtain several new utility guarantees for shuffle private stochastic convex optimization. These guarantees improve over the local model of DP and sometimes match the central model, using techniques like acceleration and smoothing.In summary, the paper expands the theory of shuffle private learning by introducing new models of interactivity, improving the accuracy of vector summation as a key building block, and leveraging these to derive convex optimization algorithms with strong accuracy guarantees. The main high-level contribution is advancing the understanding of how the intermediate trust assumptions of shuffle privacy can lead to accuracies exceeding local DP but without the full trust required by central DP.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several contributions to the study of shuffle private stochastic convex optimization:- It introduces the distinction between sequentially interactive and fully interactive shuffle protocols. Prior work has mainly focused on non-interactive or one-round protocols. Making this distinction is useful because full interactivity offers the strongest theoretical guarantees, while sequential interactivity is often more practical.- It provides new shuffle private protocols for vector summation that have variance scaling with the $\ell_2$ sensitivity rather than $\ell_1$ sensitivity. This allows for more accurate gradient computations.- It gives several new utility guarantees for convex optimization under sequential and full shuffle privacy. These improve on prior locally private guarantees and match central guarantees in the full interactive setting.- The techniques include using acceleration, smoothing, and mini-batching to obtain the utility guarantees. The combination of these algorithmic ideas with the interactive shuffle model is novel.Compared to prior work in shuffle privacy, this provides significant technical advances in terms of both the model and algorithm design. The interactive protocols and accompanying analyses are tailored to convex optimization rather than general primitives like sums and counts. The results demonstrate the power of interactivity and acceleration in the shuffle model for an important class of problems.Compared to work in central or local differential privacy for convex optimization, this paper demonstrates experimentally that there is a smooth trade-off between central and local privacy offered by the shuffle model. Both the theoretical guarantees and the algorithmic techniques bridge these two settings.Overall, this is an important contribution that substantially expands the theory and methods for an increasingly important notion of differential privacy. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art for an important class of problems.
