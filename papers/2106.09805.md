# [Shuffle Private Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09805)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces sequentially interactive and fully interactive variants of the shuffle model of differential privacy. This allows protocols that interact with users across multiple rounds, in contrast to standard one-shot shuffle protocols.

2. It provides a new shuffle-private protocol for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm sensitivity. This is done by using multiple messages per user and a variant of advanced composition tailored to the protocol's instance-specific privacy guarantee. 

3. It leverages the vector summation protocol to develop several new utility guarantees for shuffle-private stochastic convex optimization. These include guarantees for non-smooth, smooth, and strongly convex losses in both the sequentially and fully interactive models. The guarantees improve on prior locally private results and match centralized differential privacy in the full interactivity setting.

So in summary, the main research contributions are introducing new interactive variants of the shuffle model, providing protocols for private vector summation and convex optimization in these models, and analyzing the attainable utility guarantees. The central hypothesis seems to be that allowing multiple rounds of interaction will enable better utility guarantees for private learning tasks like stochastic convex optimization. The paper proves this via the concrete vector summation and optimization protocols proposed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces sequentially interactive and fully interactive variants of the shuffle model of differential privacy. This distinguishes protocols based on whether users participate in one round or multiple rounds. 

2. It provides a new shuffle private protocol for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm. This uses multiple messages per user to obtain better accuracy than prior work.

3. It applies the vector summation protocol to obtain several new utility guarantees for shuffle private stochastic convex optimization. These guarantees improve over the local model of DP and sometimes match the central model, using techniques like acceleration and smoothing.

In summary, the paper expands the theory of shuffle private learning by introducing new models of interactivity, improving the accuracy of vector summation as a key building block, and leveraging these to derive convex optimization algorithms with strong accuracy guarantees. The main high-level contribution is advancing the understanding of how the intermediate trust assumptions of shuffle privacy can lead to accuracies exceeding local DP but without the full trust required by central DP.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several contributions to the study of shuffle private stochastic convex optimization:

- It introduces the distinction between sequentially interactive and fully interactive shuffle protocols. Prior work has mainly focused on non-interactive or one-round protocols. Making this distinction is useful because full interactivity offers the strongest theoretical guarantees, while sequential interactivity is often more practical.

- It provides new shuffle private protocols for vector summation that have variance scaling with the $\ell_2$ sensitivity rather than $\ell_1$ sensitivity. This allows for more accurate gradient computations.

- It gives several new utility guarantees for convex optimization under sequential and full shuffle privacy. These improve on prior locally private guarantees and match central guarantees in the full interactive setting.

- The techniques include using acceleration, smoothing, and mini-batching to obtain the utility guarantees. The combination of these algorithmic ideas with the interactive shuffle model is novel.

Compared to prior work in shuffle privacy, this provides significant technical advances in terms of both the model and algorithm design. The interactive protocols and accompanying analyses are tailored to convex optimization rather than general primitives like sums and counts. The results demonstrate the power of interactivity and acceleration in the shuffle model for an important class of problems.

Compared to work in central or local differential privacy for convex optimization, this paper demonstrates experimentally that there is a smooth trade-off between central and local privacy offered by the shuffle model. Both the theoretical guarantees and the algorithmic techniques bridge these two settings.

Overall, this is an important contribution that substantially expands the theory and methods for an increasingly important notion of differential privacy. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art for an important class of problems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more communication-efficient protocols for vector summation under shuffle privacy. The authors note that their vector summation protocol has relatively high communication costs due to using multiple rounds of a basic scalar summation protocol. They suggest adapting more advanced summation protocols like those from prior work to reduce communication costs while still satisfying the instance-specific privacy guarantee needed for their overall optimization algorithms.

- Extending the algorithms and analysis to the distributed shuffle model with multiple shufflers. The paper currently assumes a single trusted shuffler, but distributing trust across multiple shufflers could improve robustness. Adapting the techniques to this setting is posed as an interesting open question.

- Considering alternative interactivity models between the fully interactive and sequentially interactive extremes studied in the paper. For example, the authors propose studying a limited number of interaction rounds per user as a middle ground between the two models.

- Applying the vector summation protocol to other problems beyond stochastic convex optimization, such as distributed mean estimation and frequency estimation. The summation protocol is posed as a general primitive that could enable accurate shuffle private algorithms for a range of tasks.

- Optimizing the hyperparameter choices and convergence rates further, especially for the fully interactive setting where the authors believe there is room for improvement in the dependence on the dimension $d$.

- Extending the algorithms and analysis to the local model of differential privacy. The paper focuses on shuffle privacy, but adapting the techniques to the more restrictive local model is suggested as interesting future work.

So in summary, the main directions mentioned are improving communication efficiency, extending the model, finding applications of the summation protocol, tightening analysis, and extending ideas to the local model. The paper lays solid theoretical foundations and points to many interesting ways to build on this work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proves new utility guarantees for stochastic convex optimization in the shuffle model of differential privacy, including protocols that are either sequentially or fully interactive, through the development of a new vector summation protocol with bounded l2 sensitivity and the application of techniques like acceleration, smoothing, and noisy gradient descent.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents proofs for a vector sum protocol that is shuffle private. It first describes a subroutine for summing scalars called $\ssum$ that uses fixed point encoding and binomial noise for privacy. This subroutine provides instance-specific privacy guarantees, meaning it bounds the divergence between output distributions as a function of the change in input. The paper then uses multiple invocations of $\ssum$ to construct a protocol $\vsum$ for summing vectors with bounded $\ell_2$ norm. The analysis relies on a variant of advanced composition to compose the privacy guarantees of each invocation. Finally, the paper shows how to use $\vsum$ to construct various shuffle private algorithms for stochastic convex optimization, including noisy SGD, accelerated SGD, and smoothing-based methods. The guarantees for convex optimization improve on prior locally private results and in some cases match central model results up to logarithmic factors.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents new algorithms for performing stochastic convex optimization under the constraint of shuffle differential privacy. In the shuffle model, users send randomized messages to a trusted shuffler who permutes them before passing them on to an analyzer. This provides more protection than the local model where users randomize their data themselves, but less than the central model where users send their raw data to a trusted curator. 

The main contribution is developing a protocol for privately summing vectors with bounded l2 norm sensitivity. This is combined with techniques like mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, accelerated gradient methods, and Moreau-Yosida smoothing to derive algorithms for various kinds of convex losses. Both sequentially interactive protocols, where each user participates only once, and fully interactive protocols are analyzed. The resulting excess population loss bounds improve on existing results under local differential privacy and sometimes match central model guarantees up to logarithmic factors.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces interactive shuffle protocols for stochastic convex optimization. The key technique is a new noninteractive shuffle protocol for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm. This vector summation protocol relies on multiple invocations of a scalar summation subroutine across each coordinate. The scalar summation uses a fixed point encoding with randomized rounding and binomial noise for privacy. By using this vector summation primitive in stochastic gradient steps, the authors are able to develop both sequentially interactive and fully interactive shuffle private algorithms for convex optimization. The sequentially interactive protocols apply techniques like acceleration and smoothing to attain loss guarantees better than prior locally private results. The fully interactive protocol matches central model guarantees using noisy gradient descent.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of stochastic convex optimization under the constraint of differential privacy in the shuffle model. Specifically, it is investigating how to achieve good utility guarantees for privately optimizing convex loss functions using shuffle private protocols. The main questions seem to be:

1. How to construct an accurate shuffle private protocol for vector summation that can handle vectors with bounded l2 norm sensitivity. 

2. How to leverage this vector summation protocol, along with techniques like acceleration and smoothing, to design sequentially and fully interactive shuffle private algorithms for stochastic convex optimization with good utility guarantees.

3. What utility guarantees can be achieved with these algorithms for different classes of convex loss functions (e.g. smooth vs non-smooth, strongly convex vs general convex)?

So in summary, the key focus is on developing accurate shuffle private protocols for stochastic convex optimization that can provably minimize the population loss on various convex loss function classes, using tools like vector summation, acceleration, smoothing, and interactivity.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces sequentially interactive and fully interactive variants of the shuffle model of differential privacy. In the shuffle model, users send randomized messages to a trusted shuffler who permutes the messages before passing them to an analyzer. The sequentially interactive model allows the analyzer to adaptively collect data in batches across rounds, while the fully interactive model additionally allows re-querying users across rounds. The paper also provides a new noninteractive shuffle protocol for privately summing vectors with bounded l2 norms. This protocol relies on multiple messages per user, unlike prior work. By combining this summation protocol with techniques like mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, accelerated gradient methods, and smoothing, the paper derives new utility guarantees for convex optimization under shuffle privacy. For smooth strongly convex losses, the fully interactive protocol matches central model guarantees up to logarithmic factors. The sequentially interactive protocol attains weaker but still non-trivial guarantees that improve on the local model. Hence the paper demonstrates that, compared to the extensively-studied local model, shuffle privacy enables substantially improved accuracy for convex optimization and related problems.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a shuffle private model for stochastic convex optimization. It presents protocols for privately computing vector sums with bounded l2 norm, and uses these to enable multiple rounds of noisy gradient updates. For smooth convex losses, it gives a sequentially interactive protocol with population loss Õ(d^(2/5)/n^(4/5)) and a fully interactive protocol matching the central model's Õ(sqrt(d)/n). For general convex losses, smoothing yields a sequentially interactive protocol with Õ(d^(1/3)/n^(2/3)) loss. These protocols rely on a new analysis showing shuffle privacy for multiple rounds of interaction, with each round satisfying central differential privacy. The results demonstrate that, compared to local differential privacy, the shuffle model enables substantially better accuracy for stochastic convex optimization.
