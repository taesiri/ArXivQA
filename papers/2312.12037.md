# [Founder-GPT: Self-play to evaluate the Founder-Idea fit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12037)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the "founder-idea fit", which predicts the likelihood of success for a startup based on how well the founder's skills and experience match their business idea, is challenging but crucial for investors.  
- Current methods like analyzing LinkedIn profiles can be biased and miss critical patterns from past startup successes and failures.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a new method using language models to evaluate founders against their ideas by applying techniques like:
   - Embeddings to capture nuances of founder profiles
   - Self-play for generating diverse analytical perspectives 
   - Tree-of-thought for structured reasoning
   - Critique-based refinement to improve accuracy
   - Chain of thought to build reasoning
   - Least-to-most prompting to prioritize information
- Goal is to give a more objective view of a founder's potential.

Key Contributions:
- Novel unsupervised technique to extract successful features from similar founders and ideas
- Prompt engineering methodology combining self-play, tree-of-thought, and critique-based refinement 
- Multi-step prompting approach to methodically rate founders, ideas and compute fit
- Formula to aggregate scores weighted toward significance of founder suitability
- Demonstrated analysis pipeline on real and fictional examples
- Discussed limitations around data biases and generalizability of results

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative NLP-based approach using advanced language model techniques to evaluate the founder-idea fit to assist venture capital decision-making in an objective manner. The pipeline combines various state-of-the-art tactics and applies them in a novel context.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a method to evaluate the fit between a startup founder's skills and their business idea, using language models and techniques like embeddings, self-play, tree-of-thought, and critique-based refinement to assess founders' profiles against their ideas and predict the likelihood of success.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be introducing an innovative evaluation method for assessing the "founder-idea fit" in early-stage startups. Specifically, the paper utilizes advanced large language model techniques like embeddings, self-play, tree-of-thought, and critique-based refinement to evaluate founders' profiles against their startup ideas. The goal is to enhance decision-making in evaluating the potential for success of a founder-idea pairing. The paper shows early promising results indicating that patterns of success are unique for each idea, so evaluations should consider the context of the founder's background matched to the specific idea. Overall, it's an innovative way of evaluating founder-idea fit using modern NLP techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Founder-idea fit - Assessing the match between a startup founder's skills and their business idea. Crucial for predicting success.

- Language models - Used to apply techniques like embeddings, self-play, tree-of-thought, and critique-based refinement to evaluate founders.

- Embeddings - Capturing nuances of founder profiles by mapping them to dense vectors. 

- Self-play - Models interacting with themselves to iteratively improve and refine capabilities. 

- Tree-of-thought - Constructing hierarchical prompt structures to guide language models.

- Least-to-most prompting - Starting with vague prompts then progressively adding detail to refine output.

- Critic-based refinement - Using a secondary "critic" model to evaluate and provide feedback to refine the primary model's output.  

- Prompt engineering - Designing effective prompts to optimize language model performance.

So in summary, key terms cover founder analysis, advanced LM techniques, and prompt optimization strategies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes combining aspects of Least to Most Prompting (LMP), critic-based refinement, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) for prompt design. Can you elaborate on how these different techniques are integrated? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this combined approach?

2. The paper utilizes self-play and black box optimization concepts. Can you explain how these ideas are incorporated into the overall methodology? What challenges arise in using self-play for evaluating founders and startups? 

3. Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is mentioned but not used in the final methodology. What limitations of CoT prompting led the authors to use an alternative approach? How does ToT prompting overcome these limitations?

4. The founder suitability score eta incorporates multiple factors like eta_founder, eta_idea, eta_fit. What is the rationale behind the formula used? How sensitive is eta to changes in these different components? 

5. What were some of the key preprocessing steps used for formatting the founder profiles and company descriptions? What challenges did you face in extracting the relevant features?

6. When searching for similar founders and ideas, top 3 matches from both success and failure cases are used. What is the reasoning behind choosing 3 matches? How does this impact the diversity of perspectives generated?

7. The paper mentions using a nucleus sampling technique during prompt evaluation. Can you explain this concept and why a top-p value of 0.3 was chosen? What effect does this have?

8. What techniques did you utilize to generalize the key patterns of success and failure from the similar founder/idea examples? How effective was the unsupervised feature learning?

9. The paper computes founder-idea fit as an important evaluation factor. What specific aspects are considered in quantifying this fit? What room is there for improvement?  

10. What steps could be taken to further refine and validate the predictive accuracy of this methodology over time? What data challenges need to be overcome?
