# [Founder-GPT: Self-play to evaluate the Founder-Idea fit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12037)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the "founder-idea fit", which predicts the likelihood of success for a startup based on how well the founder's skills and experience match their business idea, is challenging but crucial for investors.  
- Current methods like analyzing LinkedIn profiles can be biased and miss critical patterns from past startup successes and failures.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a new method using language models to evaluate founders against their ideas by applying techniques like:
   - Embeddings to capture nuances of founder profiles
   - Self-play for generating diverse analytical perspectives 
   - Tree-of-thought for structured reasoning
   - Critique-based refinement to improve accuracy
   - Chain of thought to build reasoning
   - Least-to-most prompting to prioritize information
- Goal is to give a more objective view of a founder's potential.

Key Contributions:
- Novel unsupervised technique to extract successful features from similar founders and ideas
- Prompt engineering methodology combining self-play, tree-of-thought, and critique-based refinement 
- Multi-step prompting approach to methodically rate founders, ideas and compute fit
- Formula to aggregate scores weighted toward significance of founder suitability
- Demonstrated analysis pipeline on real and fictional examples
- Discussed limitations around data biases and generalizability of results

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative NLP-based approach using advanced language model techniques to evaluate the founder-idea fit to assist venture capital decision-making in an objective manner. The pipeline combines various state-of-the-art tactics and applies them in a novel context.
