# [Into the crossfire: evaluating the use of a language model to   crowdsource gun violence reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12989)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Gun violence is a major human rights issue globally, but there is a lack of reliable data to understand the full scope and inform policy responses. Collecting data is challenging due to risks of in-person surveys and lack of comprehensive databases.

- Human rights organizations try to use social media data to document gun violence events, but manually reviewing the high volumes of texts is like searching for a "needle in a haystack". More automated methods are needed.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a neural network model based on BERT to accurately classify Twitter posts in Brazilian Portuguese as containing reports of gun violence or not.

- They test this model in a real-world intervention by partnering with Fogo Cruzado, a Brazilian human rights organization. Analysts used a web application with the AI model to filter and identify gun violence reports on Twitter.

Key Contributions:
- The BERT model achieves 93% accuracy and AUC of 0.97 on a human-reviewed test set, significantly outperforming baseline methods. This suggests Transformer models can effectively distinguish gun violence reports.

- Qualitative assessments show the model helps analysts work more efficiently and expand monitoring capacities. Quantitative results indicate use of the model is associated with more analyst interactions with online gun violence reports.

- This is the first known real-world evaluation showing how modern NLP methods can augment the ability of human rights organizations to crowdsource evidence of rights violations from social media data.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing and evaluating a practical AI solution to assist human rights monitoring using social media data based on state-of-the-art NLP methods. The real-world testing provides validation and insights for applying such techniques to quantitative human rights studies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors develop and evaluate a BERT-based model to identify tweets reporting gun violence in Brazil, finding it achieves high accuracy and helps human rights analysts monitor more reports when incorporated into a real-world application.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper presents the first systematic real-world evaluation of using a language model to assist human rights analysts in crowdsourcing gun violence reports from social media. Specifically:

1) The authors develop a BERT-based model that can accurately classify Portuguese tweets as containing gun violence reports or not, achieving 93% accuracy and AUC of 0.97 on a human-reviewed test set. 

2) The model is incorporated into a web application and tested in a live intervention with analysts from a Brazilian human rights organization (Fogo Cruzado) who monitor gun violence events. 

3) Both qualitative assessments (interviews, surveys) and quantitative analyses show the model helped analysts use their time more efficiently, expanded their search capacities, and increased their interactions with online users reporting gun violence events.

Overall, the paper demonstrates that modern NLP techniques like BERT can significantly augment the ability of human rights organizations to monitor citizen reports of rights violations from social media data. The mixed-methods evaluation provides insight into the real-world advantages and challenges of adopting AI for human rights monitoring.

- Real-world evaluation

The paper focuses on evaluating the use of a BERT-based natural language processing model to assist with monitoring gun violence events reported on Twitter by a Brazilian human rights organization. It combines quantitative model evaluations and a real-world intervention to study the advantages and challenges of adopting AI for social media monitoring in human rights contexts. Overall, the key themes are around applying NLP and machine learning to augment human rights investigations based on social media data, with a focus on model development, real-world testing, and mixed methods to assess impacts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using self-training to address the challenge of making inferences from partially labelled data. Can you explain more about how the self-training process worked in detail? What were the specific steps?

2. In the model development section, the authors reduced BERTimbau's maximum token length from 512 to 128 after analyzing the training data. What specific characteristics of the training data informed this decision?

3. The paper compares performance of the BERT model to two baselines - a dummy classifier and a Naive Bayes model. Why were these chosen as appropriate baselines? What are the limitations of making comparisons to these simpler models?  

4. The holdout dataset H_reports was manually reviewed and relabeled by the authors. What criteria did they use to relabel messages and what impact could this process have had on the model evaluation?

5. The paper mentions the model struggles with long texts and emojis. What modifications could be made to improve performance on these types of texts?

6. The qualitative assessments rely heavily on self-reported data from surveys and interviews. What are some limitations of this approach and how could the intervention design be improved to gather more objective metrics? 

7. The statistical analysis shows an increase in analysts' interactions with online reports after adopting the model. How might the introduction of new technology impact user behavior beyond just enhanced productivity?  

8. What risks or potential negative consequences should be considered from increased automation of human rights investigations on social media? How could these be addressed?

9. The paper focuses on a single use case of gun violence reports in Brazil. How well might the approach generalize to other languages, locations, or human rights domains? What customization would be required?

10. The partner organization continued using the prototype after the end of the study. What next steps would you recommend for them to improve and expand usage of the model long-term? What data should they track?
