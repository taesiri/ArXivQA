# [A Unified Sampling Framework for Solver Searching of Diffusion   Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07243)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new sampling framework called Unified Sampling Framework (USF) for diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). It formulates the sampling process as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and unifies existing ODE-based sampling methods by systematically categorizing all the optional strategies into several independent components, including timestep, prediction type, starting point, Taylor expansion order, derivative estimation method and correctors. Based on USF, the authors reveal that suitable solving strategies vary at different timesteps, indicating the necessity of designing a per-step scheme called solver schedule. Therefore, they propose a predictor-based multi-stage search algorithm named S3 to automatically find well-performing solver schedules under certain timestep budgets. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that S3 can discover superior schedules over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, especially under tight budgets like 4-6 steps. For example, it reduces the FID from 23.44 to 6.86 on CIFAR-10 with only 5 steps. The authors also successfully accelerate inference on the large pre-trained Stable Diffusion model from 10 steps to 5 steps without performance drop. Overall, this work offers a promising direction to systematically study and improve training-free sampling methods for DPMs.
