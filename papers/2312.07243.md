# [A Unified Sampling Framework for Solver Searching of Diffusion   Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07243)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new sampling framework called Unified Sampling Framework (USF) for diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). It formulates the sampling process as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and unifies existing ODE-based sampling methods by systematically categorizing all the optional strategies into several independent components, including timestep, prediction type, starting point, Taylor expansion order, derivative estimation method and correctors. Based on USF, the authors reveal that suitable solving strategies vary at different timesteps, indicating the necessity of designing a per-step scheme called solver schedule. Therefore, they propose a predictor-based multi-stage search algorithm named S3 to automatically find well-performing solver schedules under certain timestep budgets. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that S3 can discover superior schedules over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, especially under tight budgets like 4-6 steps. For example, it reduces the FID from 23.44 to 6.86 on CIFAR-10 with only 5 steps. The authors also successfully accelerate inference on the large pre-trained Stable Diffusion model from 10 steps to 5 steps without performance drop. Overall, this work offers a promising direction to systematically study and improve training-free sampling methods for DPMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a unified sampling framework and predictor-based multi-stage search method to automatically find optimal solver schedules for accelerating sampling in diffusion probabilistic models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new sampling framework for diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) called Unified Sampling Framework (USF). This framework unifies existing diffusion ODE solvers based on exponential integral, and allows systematically studying and conveniently implementing strategies for diffusion samplers.

2. Revealing that using different solving strategies at different timesteps can further decrease the truncation error and improve sample quality. Based on this, the paper proposes the concept of solver schedules.

3. Proposing a predictor-based multi-stage search algorithm called S3 to automatically search for well-performing solver schedules under a certain budget of number of function evaluations (NFE).

4. Experimentally demonstrating that the solver schedules found by S3 can significantly outperform state-of-the-art sampling methods on various datasets and models, especially under very tight NFE budgets. For example, on CIFAR-10, S3 achieves 2.69 FID with 10 NFE steps, much lower than the best baseline method.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the unified sampling framework and the S3 search algorithm to automatically find better solver schedules for diffusion models, achieving much faster and higher-quality sampling.

The paper proposes a unified sampling framework (USF) for studying and optimizing sampling strategies for diffusion probabilistic models. It reveals that using different solving strategies at different timesteps can further reduce error. The key idea is a "solver schedule" that assigns customized solving configurations to each timestep. To automate the search for optimal schedules, the paper proposes a predictor-based multi-stage search algorithm called S3.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown promising ability in generating high-quality images. However, sampling from DPMs requires solving the corresponding differential equations, which is time-consuming due to the large number of discretized timesteps needed for numerical accuracy. Although recent methods have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps using high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 steps still has room for improvement. 

Method:
This paper proposes a unified sampling framework (USF) to study different strategies for solving the differential equations in DPMs. The key observation is that suitable solving strategies vary among different timesteps. Therefore, the paper further proposes a predictor-based multi-stage search algorithm called S3 to automatically find the optimal per-step solving strategy (solver schedule) to achieve better time-quality trade-off.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes USF that unifies existing solvers and allows flexible choices of strategies like prediction type, expansion order, estimation methods etc. at each timestep.

- Reveals that optimal strategies for components in USF change over timesteps, making per-step schedule critical for sample quality.

- Designs a predictor-based evolutionary search method S3 that can automatically find high-performing solver schedules under limited budgets of function evaluations.

- Experiments show the searched schedules significantly outperform SOTA methods under low budgets on various datasets. For example, S3 achieves 2.69 FID with 10 steps on CIFAR-10, much lower than the best baseline.

In summary, this paper proposes a unified sampling framework and an effective schedule search algorithm to improve the sample quality of diffusion models with very few steps, without retraining the models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
