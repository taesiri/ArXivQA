# [Mono3DVG: 3D Visual Grounding in Monocular Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08022)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the novel task of 3D visual grounding in monocular RGB images using natural language expressions containing both appearance and geometry information (termed Mono3DVG). The authors contribute a large-scale dataset called Mono3DRefer with over 40K expressions for over 8K objects in 2K images from the KITTI dataset. The expressions are generated using ChatGPT and refined manually. To address this challenging task, the authors propose an end-to-end transformer-based network called Mono3DVG-TR, which effectively encodes the textual, visual, and geometric features and decodes them using a learnable query to predict 2D and 3D bounding boxes. Ablation studies validate the importance of the key components like the dual text-guided adapter and the depth-text-visual stacking attention decoder. Extensive experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. The new dataset and task could enable broader applications of grounding without requiring depth sensors or LIDAR.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper introduces a novel task of 3D visual grounding in monocular RGB images using natural language descriptions with both appearance and geometry information. Existing methods for 3D visual grounding rely on expensive RGB-D sensors, LiDARs or industrial cameras. The authors propose a new task and method to localize 3D objects in a single RGB image for broader applications.

Proposed Solution:
The authors contribute a large-scale dataset named Mono3DRefer with 41,140 expressions for the new task. To solve this task, they propose an end-to-end transformer-based network called Mono3DVG-TR. The model consists of four main components:

1) Multi-modal feature encoder: Extracts textual, visual and geometry features using RoBERTa, CNN backbone and a lightweight depth predictor. 

2) Dual text-guided adapter: Refines the visual and geometry features relevant to the referred object using text-guided attention.

3) Grounding decoder: Generates a learnable query that fuses geometry cues and visual features using depth-text-visual stacking attention.

4) Grounding head: Predicts 2D and 3D attributes of the target object using the refined query.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces a new task: 3D visual grounding in monocular RGB images using language with appearance and geometry information

- Constructs a large-scale dataset Mono3DRefer with 41k expressions based on KITTI, annotated by ChatGPT

- Proposes an end-to-end transformer-based network Mono3DVG-TR that effectively aggregates textual, visual and geometric information 

- Provides comprehensive benchmarks and analyses demonstrating the difficulty of this new task

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments, significantly outperforming baselines

In summary, the paper explores an important but challenging task to bridge vision and language for 3D visual understanding using just monocular images. The data, model and benchmarks pave the way for future research in this direction.
