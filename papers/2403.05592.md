# [Eternal Sunshine of the Mechanical Mind: The Irreconcilability of   Machine Learning and the Right to be Forgotten](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores the tension between machine learning models and the "right to be forgotten" (RTBF). Specifically, it argues that as machine learning models become more complex and brain-like, it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that personal data can be reliably deleted from them.

The paper provides background on the recent AI boom, enabled by large datasets and advances in deep learning. It also covers the legal backdrop of the RTBF in Europe. The RTBF gives individuals the right to request deletion of their personal data. 

The core argument is that machine learning models store data very differently from traditional databases. Rather than neat rows and columns, data is encoded across billions of interdependent parameter values, like a neural network. This makes selectively deleting one piece of data extremely challenging. Attempts at "machine unlearning" achieve poor accuracy. The models act as black boxes, where it's impossible to know exactly which parameters correspond to which training data.

Potential solutions are discussed, like retraining models from scratch or adding noise to the data. However, these are likely prohibitively expensive or insufficient. As models continue to advance towards artificial general intelligence, the gap widens between their brain-like nature and the feasibility of forgetting specific data per legal requirements.

In conclusion, the paper suggests machine learning and the RTBF may be fundamentally irreconcilable. Rather than try to delete data from an "electronic brain" after the fact, better solutions may be to prevent personal data from being used in training altogether, or to have models state they cannot provide certain private data. Overall, the work highlights an important open problem regarding privacy and advanced AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper argues that deep learning models, due to their structure and size, cannot reliably forget or delete data like a tabular database, and should be treated more like an imperfect mechanical brain that risks unintended deletion or retention of information if forced to "forget" specific data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be highlighting and explaining the fundamental incompatibility between machine learning models, especially large deep learning models, and the legal right to be forgotten/right to erasure of personal data. 

Specifically, the paper argues that as machine learning models become larger and more complex, resembling an "anatomical brain" in their structure and performance, it becomes increasingly difficult to truly delete or "forget" specific pieces of personal data from these models. This is because the data is captured in a distributed way across billions or trillions of parameters, making it nearly impossible to identify and selectively delete the parameters encoding a particular person's data.

The paper explains the technical details of how machine learning models work and how data is represented in their parameters. It then contrasts this with the expectations of data deletion and the right to be forgotten under regulations like GDPR. The core thesis is that as AI systems advance towards artificial general intelligence, the gap between what regulators and citizens expect in terms of data deletion and what is technically feasible will only widen. The paper serves to highlight this important issue and encourage further legal and technical work to try to reconcile machine learning with long-established data rights.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with it are:

Privacy, Data Protection, Right to be Forgotten, Machine Unlearning

I can confirm these are the keywords because they are explicitly listed under the abstract on page 2:

"\textbf{Keywords:}  \textit{Privacy, Data Protection, Right to be Forgotten, Machine Unlearning}"

So the four keywords summarizing the main topics and concepts discussed in this paper are:

1) Privacy
2) Data Protection 
3) Right to be Forgotten
4) Machine Unlearning
