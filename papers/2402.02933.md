# [InterpretCC: Conditional Computation for Inherently Interpretable Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interpretability of neural networks is critical for human-facing applications like healthcare and education, but remains a challenge. Post-hoc explanation methods require trusting the approximation and can be inconsistent. Intrinsically interpretable models often compromise performance or provide limited interpretability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes InterpretCC, a family of interpretable-by-design neural networks that provide guaranteed interpretability through conditional computation paths, while maintaining high performance.

Main Contributions:
- Feature Gating architecture: Uses a discriminator to select a sparse subset of input features that are fed into a model to make predictions. Provides simple and concise explanations.

- Group Routing architecture: Routes input features into human-interpretable expert subnetworks based on rules or models. Subnetworks are selectively activated and aggregated for the final prediction. Enables understanding of model reasoning.  

- Evaluation across education, text, and healthcare tasks demonstrating comparable performance to complex baseline models, along with intuitive explanations about important input features or subsets driving decisions.

- Concept of conditional computation for interpretability, adapting instance-dependent gating and routing typically used for efficiency, to instead explicitly model interpretability and sparsity objectives.

In summary, the paper introduces InterpretCC architectures that provide trustworthy, intuitive explanations by modeling inherent interpretability objectives into the model design through conditional computation paths, without sacrificing accuracy. The approach is demonstrated to be effective across a range of real-world domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents InterpretCC, a family of interpretable neural network architectures that use conditional computation to activate sparse sets of features or expert subnetworks to provide locally faithful and understandable explanations without compromising predictive performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents two interpretable neural network architectures: Feature Gating and Group Routing. Feature Gating uses a discriminator network to select a sparse subset of features to feed into the prediction model. Group Routing routes inputs to different subnetworks based on human-interpretable groupings of features.

2) It evaluates variations of these architectures on real-world datasets across different modalities - time series (education), tabular (healthcare), and text (sentiment, news). The models demonstrate comparable performance to baseline models while providing interpretability.

3) The paper introduces the idea of using conditional computation in neural networks to create interpretable reasoning paths. The models provide concise explanations that indicate the specific features or feature groups used for each individual prediction. 

4) The Group Routing architecture allows incorporating human domain knowledge to define interpretable groupings. It also enables adaptively selecting groups and experts per data point.

In summary, the main contribution is an interpretable-by-design neural network framework that provides trustworthy, understandable, and personalized explanations while maintaining predictive accuracy across multiple real-world application domains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two main architectures: feature gating and group routing. What are the key differences between these two approaches and what are their relative strengths and weaknesses?

2. The group routing method uses a mixture of expert models. What considerations went into determining how to group features into expert subnetworks? How sensitive is model performance and interpretability to the choice of groupings?

3. The paper evaluates the method on time series, text, and tabular datasets. What modifications or adaptions were required to apply the method to each data type? How does sparsity manifest differently across modalities? 

4. Dynamic feature selection is claimed to improve model performance over fixing the number of features. What experiments support this claim? What metrics are used to evaluate the contribution of dynamic selection?

5. For the education datasets, three strategies are used to determine feature groupings - by paper, by pattern, and by prompting GPT-4. How do the groupings and subsequent model performance differ across strategies? What biases might be inherent in each?

6. The Gumbel-softmax trick is used to make discrete gating decisions differentiable. Walk through how this allows gradients to flow through the routing architectures during training. What is the effect of using hard vs soft decisions?

7. The paper evaluates interpretability qualitatively through case studies and example model decisions. What quantitative metrics could supplement these analyses to more rigorously measure interpretability?

8. The document highlights domain areas like education, healthcare, and sentiment analysis as motivations. How might the desirable properties for interpretability differ across domains? How could the method be adapted?

9. For text data, word embeddings are used to map tokens to human-interpretable concepts based on the Dewey Decimal system. Critique this mapping approach - what are the limitations? How could it be improved?

10. The method yields comparable overall performance to baseline neural networks while providing interpretability. For what types of problems might there need to be an explicit tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability? When would this approach not be suitable?
