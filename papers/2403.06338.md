# [Disentangling shared and private latent factors in multimodal   Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) like MVAE and MMVAE are used for disentangling shared and private latent factors in multi-omics data. 
- However, they struggle to identify subtle shared latent structure when there is a lot of dominant modality-specific variation, which is common due to variable feature dimensionality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes the inductive biases of MVAE and MMVAE from a cross-modal prediction perspective. 
- It shows MMVAE is better suited for this task due to explicitly modeling all modality pairs in its training objective.
- However, MMVAE still struggles with high private variation. 
- The paper proposes MMVAE++ which restricts gradient updates to the shared latent variables to only flow through cross-modal reconstruction terms.

Contributions:
- Systematically compares MVAE, MMVAE and the proposed MMVAE++ in challenging scenarios with imbalanced modalities and increasing private variation.
- Shows existing models break down while MMVAE++ is more robust in learning shared factors.
- Demonstrates limitations on synthetic and real multi-omics datasets including a CLL study, BRCA study, and single-cell RNA-seq+ATAC-seq data.
- Overall, highlights need for careful consideration of inductive biases when designing multimodal VAEs for disentanglement tasks.

In summary, the key idea is that MMVAE++ has superior inductive biases for cross-modal prediction that allow it to better disentangle private and shared factors compared to prior multimodal VAEs. The paper clearly demonstrates this through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real biological datasets.
