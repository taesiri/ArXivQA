# [Disentangling shared and private latent factors in multimodal   Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) like MVAE and MMVAE are used for disentangling shared and private latent factors in multi-omics data. 
- However, they struggle to identify subtle shared latent structure when there is a lot of dominant modality-specific variation, which is common due to variable feature dimensionality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes the inductive biases of MVAE and MMVAE from a cross-modal prediction perspective. 
- It shows MMVAE is better suited for this task due to explicitly modeling all modality pairs in its training objective.
- However, MMVAE still struggles with high private variation. 
- The paper proposes MMVAE++ which restricts gradient updates to the shared latent variables to only flow through cross-modal reconstruction terms.

Contributions:
- Systematically compares MVAE, MMVAE and the proposed MMVAE++ in challenging scenarios with imbalanced modalities and increasing private variation.
- Shows existing models break down while MMVAE++ is more robust in learning shared factors.
- Demonstrates limitations on synthetic and real multi-omics datasets including a CLL study, BRCA study, and single-cell RNA-seq+ATAC-seq data.
- Overall, highlights need for careful consideration of inductive biases when designing multimodal VAEs for disentanglement tasks.

In summary, the key idea is that MMVAE++ has superior inductive biases for cross-modal prediction that allow it to better disentangle private and shared factors compared to prior multimodal VAEs. The paper clearly demonstrates this through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real biological datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the capabilities of different multimodal variational autoencoders to reliably disentangle shared and private latent factors in challenging real-world scenarios with dominant modality-specific variation, and proposes a modification called MMVAE++ that is significantly more robust in inferring shared latent structure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a modification to the MMVAE model called MMVAE++ that makes it more robust at learning shared latent factors in multimodal data when there is a lot of modality-specific variation. Specifically:

- The paper highlights that existing multimodal VAE models like MVAE, MMVAE, and MoPoE-VAE can struggle to identify shared latent factors when one modality has dominant private/modality-specific variation, which is common in real-world heterogeneous data. 

- Through the lens of cross-modal prediction, the paper discusses inductive biases in these models and how the MMVAE objective may make it more amenable for learning shared factors.

- However, MMVAE still struggles with high private variation. To address this, the authors propose MMVAE++ which restricts gradient updates through the shared latent variables to only cross-modal terms. 

- Experiments on synthetic and real multi-omics data demonstrate MMVAE++ has significantly improved robustness in learning shared factors and cross-modal prediction performance when there is a lot of modality-specific variation.

In summary, the key contribution is the analysis of limitations of existing multimodal VAEs and the proposal of an improved model (MMVAE++) that is more robust for disentangling shared and private variation in challenging real-world scenarios.

- Cross-modal prediction
- Multi-omics data integration
- Imbalanced and high-dimensional data modalities
- MVAE, MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE
- Proposed modification: MMVAE++
- Comparative evaluation on synthetic and real datasets

The paper investigates the capabilities of different MVAE models to reliably disentangle private and shared latent factors, especially in challenging scenarios with dominant modality-specific variation. It highlights inductive biases in existing models regarding cross-modal prediction and proposes a modification to MMVAE called MMVAE++ that is more robust. The key focus is on disentanglement of latent representations and cross-modal prediction performance on synthetic and real multi-omics datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes MMVAE++ as a modification of MMVAE to make it more robust to high levels of modality-specific variation. What is the key idea behind MMVAE++ and how does it differ from the original MMVAE objective?

2. The paper argues that the inductive biases of MVAE, MMVAE, and MoPoE-VAE affect their ability to reliably learn shared latent factors. Can you summarize the key differences in inductive biases between these models and how that relates to cross-modal prediction?

3. Why does high modality-specific variation pose challenges for identifying shared latent factors in multimodal VAEs? Explain the failure modesobserved in the experiments when increasing private features.

4. The supervised variants incorporate label information to guide learning of shared latent representations. What is the formulation of the supervised training objective? Discuss the relative benefits and limitations of using label supervision.

5. This paper evaluates model performance through cross-modal prediction. Explain how this metric captures the quality of shared latent representations and the disentanglement of private vs shared factors. What are other suitable evaluation approaches?

6. The chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) experiment highlights interesting model behaviors when gradually increasing gene expression features unrelated to the IGHV biomarker. Analyze and discuss the detailed results.

7. The TCGA breast cancer analysis involves highly imbalanced modalities in terms of dimensionality. Why does this pose difficulty for multimodal VAEs and how does MMVAE++ overcome this? Can you suggest any data preprocessing steps that could help?

8. For the single cell experiment, supervised variants achieve near perfect separation while some unsupervised models start declining in AUC when increasing unrelated genes. What explains this performance gap? How suitable are labels for single cell applications?

9. This work considers two data modalities. How readily could the analyses and conclusions extend to settings with more than 2 modalities? What are some key additional complexities?

10. The paper focuses specifically on applications involving multi-omics data, but multimodal VAEs are used more broadly. In what other areas could insights from this work translate to? Can you describe any domain-specific challenges that may require tailored solutions?
