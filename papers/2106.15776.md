# [Local Reweighting for Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15776)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

Can a robust neural network model be trained to defend against various adversarial attacks, not just a specific attack used during training?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The relative vulnerability of instances to adversarial attacks is inconsistent across different attacks. Instances that are robust to one type of attack may be vulnerable to another.

2) Existing adversarial training methods that assign instance-specific weights, like IRAT, can overfit to the particular attack used during training. This leads to reduced robustness on unseen attacks. 

3) A training approach called Locally Reweighted Adversarial Training (LRAT) that performs local reweighting within instance-attack pairs, while avoiding global reweighting across instances, can improve robustness on diverse attacks.

So in summary, the central research question is how to train models robust to diverse adversarial attacks, not just a single attack. The key hypothesis is that LRAT, through local reweighting, can achieve improved robustness compared to methods like IRAT that assign global instance weights. The experiments aim to demonstrate this improved generalized robustness of LRAT across different attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new adversarial training method called Locally Reweighted Adversarial Training (LRAT). 

The key ideas of LRAT are:

- It pairs each instance with its adversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, rather than doing global reweighting across all instances like prior work on instance reweighting.

- The rationale is to fit the instance itself if it is immune to a given attack, but still keep the pair to passively defend against different attacks, rather than skip or downweight the pair like global reweighting methods.

- It uses a general vulnerability-based reweighting strategy that can work with different attacks, rather than a heuristic based on PGD steps.

- It assigns some minimum weight to the natural data term to avoid overly downweighting instances, to defend against unseen attacks.

The authors argue that global reweighting methods like prior work can overly downweight instances, harming generalization to unseen attacks. The local reweighting of LRAT is shown to improve robustness compared to no reweighting, global reweighting, and their combination.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing this new locally reweighted adversarial training approach to improve robustness to diverse adversarial attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on adversarial training methods for deep neural networks. Adversarial training is a hot topic in ML security and robustness. Many recent papers have looked at novel adversarial training procedures or modifications to improve robustness. This paper builds off that line of work.

- The key contribution here is proposing a new locally reweighted adversarial training (LRAT) method to address limitations of prior work on instances-reweighted adversarial training (IRAT). So it is extending IRAT and analyzing/fixing some of its shortcomings. 

- The authors motivate the need for LRAT by providing empirical analysis on the inconsistent vulnerability of instances to different attacks. This highlights an overlooked issue with previous methods. Other papers have not directly analyzed this phenomenon in detail.

- Most prior adversarial training methods either do no reweighting (standard AT) or global reweighting (IRAT). By proposing a local reweighting scheme, this represents a new approach in between those extremes.

- The paper includes thorough experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN comparing LRAT to standard AT and IRAT. The results support the benefits of their proposed local reweighting strategy. Other papers have not directly tested this type of approach.

- The authors also design LRAT versions for existing methods like TRADES. Showing the approach can be integrated into the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the general applicability of the local reweighting idea.

- Overall, this paper makes an important empirical contribution in analyzing limitations of prior work, and proposes a novel local reweighting adversarial training method to address them. The approach appears to outperform previous global reweighting and no reweighting strategies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The authors point out that many real-world problems require multiple agents interacting, but MARL is computationally challenging due to the increased complexity. Developing more efficient algorithms and approximations for MARL is an important direction.

- Examining how well MARL algorithms can scale in terms of the number of agents. Most MARL algorithms have only been tested with a small number of agents, so studying their performance with many agents and in massive multi-agent systems is an open research issue. 

- Studying how concepts from single agent RL like hierarchical RL can be applied or extended to the multi-agent case. Hierarchical approaches could help address the complexity of MARL.

- Developing frameworks to learn coordinated group behaviors and team strategies in MARL. Enabling agents to learn complex cooperative strategies through MARL algorithms is an important direction.

- Incorporating ideas from game theory into MARL algorithms, to better handle coordination and competitive/collaborative interactions between learning agents.

- Exploring how MARL can be applied to a wider range of real-world problems, and demonstrating its value for complex coordination and collaboration scenarios like traffic control, robot swarm coordination, and distributed logistics.

- Investigating and developing approaches for enabling transfer learning and generalization in MARL, which could allow agents to rapidly adapt to new environments or goals.

- Studying fairness, safety, robustness, and ethics in the context of MARL, which become important issues when learning and decision-making is distributed across multiple agents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a locally reweighted adversarial training method that assigns instance-dependent weights to adversarial examples during training to improve robustness against diverse attacks, unlike prior global reweighting methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new adversarial training method called Locally Reweighted Adversarial Training (LRAT) to improve model robustness against adversarial attacks. Previous work on Instance-Reweighted Adversarial Training (IRAT) assigns smaller weights to data instances that are less vulnerable and larger weights to more vulnerable instances under a given attack simulated during training. However, the paper shows IRAT leads to significantly reduced robustness on unseen attacks not simulated during training. The authors argue instance vulnerability is attack-dependent, so IRAT's global reweighting can be misleading if the attack is mis-specified. LRAT instead performs local reweighting by pairing each instance with its adversarial variants and reweighting losses within each pair, while avoiding global reweighting across instances. This allows it to passively defend against different attacks not simulated during training. Experiments show LRAT improves robustness over standard adversarial training and IRAT when tested on attacks different from those used during training. LRAT provides a general framework for more powerful reweighted adversarial training against diverse potential attacks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new adversarial training method called locally reweighted adversarial training (LRAT) to improve model robustness. Previous work has shown that reweighting training instances based on vulnerability (instance reweighted adversarial training, IRAT) can improve robustness on a given attack. However, the paper shows that this leads to significantly reduced robustness on unseen attacks. They argue that instance vulnerability should be considered attack-dependent rather than global. 

To address this, LRAT pairs each instance with its adversarial variants and performs local reweighting within each pair, without global reweighting across instances. This allows it to passively defend against different attacks. LRAT uses a general vulnerability-based weighting scheme rather than one tailored to a specific attack like prior work. Experiments show LRAT improves robustness over both standard adversarial training and IRAT when evaluated on attacks different from the one used during training. It also outperforms baselines when applied to existing methods like TRADES. The local reweighting approach provides a way to train robust models without sacrificing performance on unseen attacks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a locally reweighted adversarial training (LRAT) method to improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks. LRAT pairs each instance with its adversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while avoiding global reweighting across all instances. Specifically, it assigns larger weights to the losses of more vulnerable adversarial variants and smaller weights to the losses of less vulnerable variants for the same instance. This allows it to fit each instance better if it is already robust to the attack, while still training on all instances/variant pairs to passively improve robustness against diverse future attacks. The vulnerability of each variant is measured by an attack-dependent function rather than a heuristic like geometry distance. The overall objective includes a natural data term with a gentle lower weight bound to avoid discarding instances during training. Experiments show LRAT improves robustness over standard adversarial training and global reweighting methods when tested on attacks different than those used during training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It investigates limitations of the instance-reweighted adversarial training (IRAT) method. IRAT assigns lower weights to data instances that are less vulnerable to a given adversarial attack simulated during training. 

- The paper finds that IRAT leads to significantly reduced robustness on unseen attacks not simulated during training. Many instances get very low weights in IRAT, essentially discarding them during training. 

- It argues that instance vulnerability is attack-dependent - an instance less vulnerable to one attack may be more vulnerable to a different attack. So IRAT's global instance weighting based on a single attack is flawed.

- To address this, the paper proposes locally reweighted adversarial training (LRAT). It pairs each instance with its adversarial variants and performs local reweighting within each pair, without global reweighting across instances.

- The rationale is to fit the instance if it's immune to the given attack, but retain it to passively defend against other unseen attacks. LRAT uses attack-dependent vulnerability measures for reweighting.

- Experiments show LRAT improves robustness over IRAT and standard adversarial training when tested on attacks different from those used during training.

In summary, the key question addressed is how to make adversarial training more robust to diverse unseen attacks, by investigating and addressing limitations of IRAT's global instance reweighting approach. The proposed LRAT method performs local reweighting to account for attack-dependent vulnerabilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Adversarial examples - Test inputs that are slightly modified to cause misclassification. Defending against adversarial examples is a key challenge.

- Adversarial training - Training neural networks on adversarial examples, with the goal of making the models more robust to such inputs.

- Standard adversarial training (SAT) - Training on adversarial examples generated by projected gradient descent. 

- Geometry-aware instance reweighted adversarial training (GAIRAT) - A type of adversarial training that reweights training instances based on their geometric distance to the decision boundary. Assigns lower weight to "safe" instances.

- Locally reweighted adversarial training (LRAT) - The proposed adversarial training method. Pairs each instance with adversarial variants and reweights locally within each pair, avoiding global reweighting.

- Inconsistent vulnerability - The paper argues instances have differing vulnerability to different adversarial attacks. This makes global reweighting problematic. 

- Robustness - Ability of a model to make correct predictions in the face of adversarial perturbations. Key evaluation metric.

- Reweighting - Adjusting the loss contribution of different training instances. LRAT does local reweighting within instance-variant pairs.

- PGD attack - Projected gradient descent attack, a common adversarial attack method.

- Carlini & Wagner attack - Another adversarial attack method, shown to be inconsistent with PGD.

So in summary, the key focus is on adversarial training and specifically the use of local vs global reweighting of training instances to improve robustness to different adversarial attacks.
