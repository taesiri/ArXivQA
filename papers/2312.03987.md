# [Cost-Effective In-Context Learning for Entity Resolution: A Design Space   Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03987)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a cost-effective batch prompting framework called BatchER for entity resolution. Entity resolution aims to identify when two entities refer to the same real-world object, and is crucial for data integration tasks. While state-of-the-art solutions rely on fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on large labeled datasets, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable in-context learning without updating model parameters. However, existing in-context learning approaches for entity resolution require providing demonstrations for each entity pair, incurring high cost. To address this, BatchER explores batch prompting, which allows querying batches of entity pairs to reduce cost. Specifically, BatchER consists of demonstration selection and question batching modules. Through comprehensive experiments, the authors categorize and evaluate various design choices, and find that combining diversity-based question batching and a novel covering-based demonstration selection strategy works best. Compared to standard prompting and manually designed prompts, BatchER with 8 questions per batch achieves 4-7x cost reduction and comparable accuracy to PLMs trained on thousands of examples. The design space exploration and insights provide guidance for developing cost-effective in-context learning solutions for entity resolution.

3. It proposes a novel covering-based demonstration selection strategy that selects a minimal set of demonstrations to cover all the questions in a batch. This aims to balance accuracy and cost.

4. It conducts a thorough experimental evaluation to compare different design choices and batch prompting strategies. The key findings provide guidance on selecting effective and cost-efficient batch prompting approaches for entity resolution.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Entity resolution (ER) is an important data integration task with many applications. State-of-the-art solutions rely on fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) using extensive labeled data, which is expensive. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for in-context learning (ICL) without tuning parameters, using only a few demonstrations. However, existing ICL methods for ER require providing demonstrations for each entity pair, incurring high cost. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a cost-effective batch prompting framework called BatchER for ER using LLMs. Key components include:

(1) Question batching: Groups multiple entity pairs into batches to query together. Explores similarity-based, diversity-based, and random strategies.

(2) Demonstration selection: Selects relevant demonstrations to guide LLM for each batch. Proposes fixed, top-k per batch, top-k per question, and a new covering-based strategy to minimize labeling cost.  

(3) Covering-based selection: Models demonstration selection as a set cover problem to minimize labeled data while covering all questions in batches. Develops a greedy algorithm.

Contributions:

(1) Comprehensively explores design space and strategies for batch prompting for ER.

(2) Proposes a new covering-based demonstration selection method to balance accuracy and cost.

(3) Extensive experiments show BatchER is 4-7x cheaper than standard prompting and achieves better accuracy. Outperforms PLMs and manual prompting baselines.

(4) Provides insights and guidance on effective design choices for batch prompting for ER.

The paper makes notable contributions in developing a cost-effective batch prompting framework for ER using LLMs' capability for in-context learning, with extensive empirical analysis.
