# [Solving Hierarchical Information-Sharing Dec-POMDPs: An Extensive-Form   Game Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02954)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Multi-agent decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDPs) allow modeling of collaborative multi-agent settings with partial observability and decentralized execution. However, they suffer from high computational complexity and lack of scalability. 

- This paper focuses on Dec-POMDPs with hierarchical information sharing (HIS) structure, where an agent has access to observations and actions of agents below it in the hierarchy. HIS matches many real-world scenarios like autonomous vehicles, assembly lines, etc.

- Prior global optimization methods for Dec-POMDPs fail to scale due to:
  - Backups require optimizing over joint action space leading to double exponential complexity
  - Number of decision variables grows exponentially with agents and time
  
Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows that under HIS, Dec-POMDP backups can be formulated as extensive-form games with perfect information and common payoffs. This allows separate optimization over each agent's action space.

- The concept of nested-occupancy states is introduced, which serves as a sufficient statistic for decision making. This allows aggregation of histories with same information.

- A point-based value iteration algorithm, hPBVI, is presented that exploits above findings for efficient backups and scales to more agents.


Main Contributions:
- Proof that under HIS, Dec-POMDP backups can be solved optimally using extensive form games with single agent sequential decision making. This reduces double exponential joint action space optimization to linear complexity.

- Introduction of nested-occupancy states that compress histories leading to faster estimation and backups.

- hPBVI algorithm that implements above findings allowing scale up to larger number of agents compared to prior methods, while preserving optimality.

- Empirical evaluations demonstrate order of magnitude gains in average backup time and scalability over state-of-the-art approaches on several Dec-POMDP benchmarks.

In summary, the paper develops important theoretical properties and an algorithm for Dec-POMDPs under HIS that enable scalable application of such models to real-world multi-agent coordination problems.
