# [Towards learning-based planning:The nuPlan benchmark for real-world   autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04133)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces nuPlan, the world's first real-world autonomous driving dataset and benchmark for evaluating machine learning-based motion planning systems. 

Problem:
While machine learning has transformed perception and prediction for autonomous vehicles, adoption of ML techniques for planning has been slow. Reasons include:
- Difficulty in generalizing to diverse driving scenarios from limited data
- Driving scenarios follow a long-tail distribution, exacerbating generalization issues
- Lack of safety guarantees in learned planning systems

Existing datasets and benchmarks focus only on prediction, lack key elements like traffic lights or scenario tags, and do not support closed-loop simulation to account for interactions between the ego vehicle and other agents.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose nuPlan, which contains:

1) A large-scale driving dataset with 1282 hours of data across 4 cities, including sensor data (128 hours) and auto-labeled tracks for objects and traffic lights. Scenarios are tagged to enable fine-grained evaluation.

2) A modular, flexible simulation framework that enables open-loop playback and closed-loop simulation to evaluate planners. The framework simulates interactions between the ego vehicle and other reactive agents.  

3) An evaluation protocol with metrics to measure safety, comfort, progress, etc. in open and closed-loop modes.

Main Contributions:
- Largest and most diverse real-world AV dataset with auto-labeled tracks and traffic lights 
- High-fidelity sensor data release (lidar, camera)
- Modular simulation framework for open and closed-loop planning evaluation
- Thorough benchmarking of planning approaches to identify gaps between traditional and learned planning

The goal is to facilitate research into learning-based planning, prediction-planning integration, and end-to-end planning from sensor data.
