# [Harnessing the Power of Neural Operators with Automatically Encoded   Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural operators (NOs) have emerged as effective tools for modeling complex physical systems by learning the governing laws directly from data. However, in contrast to other machine learning applications, partial knowledge is often available about conservation laws (e.g. mass, energy, momentum) that should be satisfied in the physical system. Currently, NOs have to learn these laws purely from finite, noisy data and can only approximately satisfy them. This limits their accuracy and robustness, especially when data is scarce.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes conservation law-encoded neural operators (clawNOs) which guarantee automatic satisfaction of fundamental conservation laws by baking them into the neural network architecture. This is achieved in two key steps:

1. The output of the NO is designed to be divergence-free by representing it as the divergence of an antisymmetric matrix-valued function. This automatically satisfies mass/volume conservation.

2. A numerical differentiation layer with pre-computed weights is introduced to evaluate spatial/temporal derivatives and recover the divergence-free target function.

Main Contributions:

- ClawNOs constrain solutions to a physically consistent manifold independent of noise or limited data, enhancing accuracy and robustness, especially for small datasets. 

- The method only relies on data, without needing known governing equations. It is readily applicable as an add-on to any NO architecture like FNOs or GNOs.

- Conservation laws are imposed through the built-in architecture itself instead of loss penalties. The framework is general enough to encode conservation of mass, momentum, energy etc. in various dimensions.

- ClawNOs achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art NOs on challenging scientific problems like Navier-Stokes flows, shallow water equations and material deformation modeling. Improvements are most significant in small-data regimes.
