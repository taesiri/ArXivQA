# [Leveraging AI Planning For Detecting Cloud Security Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10985)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cloud computing platforms like AWS provide convenient and scalable data storage and processing capabilities. However, misconfigurations in their access control policies can lead to security vulnerabilities and attacks like data breaches, ransomware etc.  
- Tools exist to analyze cloud configurations but have limitations: only check current state rather than possible attack sequences, focused on specific attacks like privilege escalation rather than modeling diverse threats, don't provide full attack plans to help validation.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent cloud system using relational tuples describing which identities can access resources. Easily extensible and explainable.
- Model the problem of detecting attacks like ransomware and data theft as a PDDL planning problem. Define actions for permission flow between entities, expanding permissions, adding relations, and enabling different attack types.  
- Given a compromised user, planner searches possible sequences to accomplish an attack goal state.

Key Contributions:
- Generic tuple-based formulation to represent cloud access control configurations and permissions.
- PDDL modeling to systematically search for multi-step attack plans exploiting cloud misconfigurations. Handles diverse threats beyond just privilege escalation.
- Evaluation on real cloud systems from 14 commercial organizations. Identified 425 non-admin users vulnerable to at least one attack type. Significantly more comprehensive than existing tools.

In summary, the paper presents a formal planning framework using PDDL to model diverse cloud attack types and automatically identify multi-step attack possibilities from access control misconfigurations in real cloud systems. Key novelty is the ability to detect a broader range of vulnerabilities compared to prior art.
