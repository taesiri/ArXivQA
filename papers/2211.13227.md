# [Paint by Example: Exemplar-based Image Editing with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How can we perform precise and controllable image editing by using an exemplar image as guidance, rather than text prompts? 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes a new exemplar-based image editing approach, where an exemplar image provided by the user is transformed and blended into the source image for semantic manipulation. This allows more precise control compared to text-guided editing.

- Trains an image-conditioned diffusion model in a self-supervised manner, where the exemplar is a cropped region from the source image. Identifies and handles the issue of the model learning to naively copy-paste the exemplar. 

- Introduces several techniques - leveraging image prior, strong augmentation, information bottleneck, and classifier-free guidance - to avoid the copy-paste issue and improve image quality and controllability.

- Achieves high-quality and controllable semantic image editing results on complex images, without needing image-specific fine-tuning. Outperforms prior arts quantitatively and qualitatively.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that exemplar-based conditioning can enable more precise image editing than text guidance. The paper proposes techniques to train such an exemplar-based diffusion model in a self-supervised setting, while preventing trivial copy-paste solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel exemplar-based image editing approach that allows semantically altering the image content according to a reference image provided by the user. The key contributions are:

1. It introduces a new image editing scenario where the user can precisely control the editing based on an exemplar image rather than just text descriptions. This allows conveying more fine-grained editing intentions through the exemplar. 

2. It proposes to train an image-conditioned diffusion model in a self-supervised manner for this task. To avoid the model learning a trivial copy-paste mapping, it proposes several techniques including using a pretrained text-to-image model as prior, compressing the exemplar image information, and applying strong augmentations. 

3. It enables control over the edit region shape and similarity to the exemplar through irregular mask shapes and classifier-free guidance.

4. It demonstrates strong results on in-the-wild images, outperforming prior arts qualitatively and quantitatively. The approach requires only a single forward pass without optimization.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new exemplar-based image editing approach and a set of techniques to make it work well, which shows improved editing control and quality over text-based and image harmonization baselines. It could serve as a strong baseline for future research in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an exemplar-based image editing approach using diffusion models, which allows semantically altering image content by painting with a conditional image while achieving high-quality and controllable results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related research in exemplar-based image editing:

- Most prior work in semantic image editing relies on GAN models, which struggle to edit complex scenes or diverse objects. This paper leverages powerful diffusion models which have shown better image generation capabilities.

- Existing text-driven image editing methods can lack fine-grained control. This paper proposes the new task of exemplar-based editing, using reference images instead of text prompts to provide more precise editing guidance.  

- The paper introduces several techniques to train the diffusion model in a self-supervised manner for exemplar-based editing, overcoming the lack of paired training data. These include using an image prior, aggressive augmentations, an information bottleneck, and classifier-free guidance.

- Many image composition methods focus only on low-level harmonization, without semantic transformations. This paper enables more complex editing by semantically altering the exemplar to fit the target image.

- Most text or exemplar-driven editing techniques require per-image optimization or fine-tuning. This paper performs the editing in a single feed-forward pass of the diffusion model, allowing efficient application.

- Quantitative and human evaluations demonstrate this method's advantages over prior art like Blended Diffusion and image harmonization methods. The technique works robustly for diverse general images.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of semantic image editing by enabling precise exemplar-based control through diffusion models. The training strategies and evaluation benchmarks introduced could serve as a strong baseline for future research in this emerging field.
