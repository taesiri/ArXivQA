## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Designing novel and effective metaheuristic algorithms (MAs) is challenging and requires substantial expertise. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to automate and accelerate this process. 

- However, properly instructing the LLM and designing good prompts is critical to generate useful outputs. The paper aims to address this issue.

Methodology:
- The authors propose using the LLM ChatGPT-3.5 along with the CRISPE prompt engineering framework to automatically design a novel bio-inspired MA called Zoological Search Optimization (ZSO).  

- The CRISPE framework carefully crafts a capacity-and-role, insight, statement, personality, and experiment based prompt to engage ChatGPT-3.5 as an expert in MAs. 

- ChatGPT-3.5 then provides detailed pseudocode and explanations for the ZSO algorithm, which combines prey-predator interactions and social flocking behaviors from nature.

- Four variants of ZSO are also introduced by manually tuning key hyperparameters.

Experiments:
- Comprehensive experiments compare ZSO and its four variants against 20 state-of-the-art MAs over three testbeds: 
  1) CEC2014 benchmark
  2) CEC2022 benchmark
  3) Six engineering optimization problems
  
- Statistical tests confirm the competitiveness of ZSO, especially for unimodal, multimodal and hybrid problems. 

Main Contributions:
- First work to leverage LLMs via careful prompt design to automatically generate a novel and highly competitive bio-inspired MA
- Providing a methodology to augment human expertise in designing optimization algorithms
- Confirming the feasibility of using LLMs to promote innovation in the metaheuristics field under strict experimental validation
- Discussing future collaborative prospects between LLMs and metaheuristics to advance both fields

In summary, the paper proposes and verifies using LLMs to automatically design novel optimization algorithms as a promising direction that can transform and enhance the metaheuristics field.
