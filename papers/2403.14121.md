# [External Knowledge Enhanced 3D Scene Generation from Sketch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Generating realistic 3D scenes is challenging due to the complexity of room layouts and object geometries. Existing methods have limitations in generating customized and diverse 3D scenes that align with user specifications. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a sketch based knowledge enhanced diffusion model (SEK) for generating customized, diverse and plausible 3D scenes. The key ideas are:

1) Represent a scene as a combination of 3D objects and their relationships, and diffuse it to a Gaussian distribution. 

2) Propose a 3D denoising scene transformer that learns to reverse the diffusion process. The denoising is conditioned on:

- A hand-drawn sketch of the target scene: Captures user specifications.

- Cues from an external knowledge base of object relationships: Resolves ambiguities in sketch, introduces unseen objects.

3) Construct a knowledge base containing rich priors of object relationships from training data. Propose knowledge enhanced graph reasoning to extract relevant knowledge for a given sketch.

4) Integrate sketch and knowledge features via multi-head attention to form diffusion condition. Use a spectrum filter to suppress invalid padding in scene representation.

Main Contributions:

- Novel sketch & knowledge conditioned diffusion model for 3D scene generation.

- External knowledge base construction and reasoning for sketch enhancement.

- 3D denoising scene transformer with spectrum filtering to handle scene representation.

- State-of-the-art performance on 3D-FRONT dataset for scene generation and completion tasks. Knowledge transfers well to ScanNet dataset.

The model generates customized and diverse 3D scenes that align with sketch while leveraging knowledge to enhance details and introduce unseen objects. Both scene layout and 3D shapes are generated simultaneously.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a sketch and knowledge-enhanced diffusion model for generating customized, diverse, and plausible 3D indoor scenes by conditioning the diffusion process on a hand-drawn sketch along with object relationship knowledge extracted from an external knowledge base.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel sketch based knowledge-enhanced diffusion method for generating customized, diverse, and plausible 3D scenes. The method conditions the denoising process on a hand-drawn sketch of the target scene along with cues from an object relationship knowledge base.

2. It constructs an external knowledge base defining various object relationships to provide additional guidance and improve the plausibility of the generated scenes, including both layout and detailed object shapes.

3. It introduces a knowledge-enhanced graph reasoning module to extract relevant knowledge from the knowledge base based on user-specified entities and integrate it with the sketch features to guide scene generation.

4. It proposes a 3D denoising scene transformer that operates in the latent space to alleviate the influence of padding constants corresponding to invalid objects in the scene representation.

5. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on 3D scene generation and promising results on 3D scene completion tasks compared to previous methods. The knowledge base also demonstrates good transferability to other datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel generative framework for sketch-based 3D scene modeling, enhanced by reasoning on an external knowledge base to improve alignment, diversity and plausibility.
