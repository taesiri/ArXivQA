# [Block Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation and Application to   $β$-NMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers a class of multi-convex optimization problems where the objective function is the sum of multi-convex functions in different blocks of variables. These problems arise in applications like nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). 

- Standard block coordinate descent methods like block majorization-minimization (BMM) can be slow to converge. The paper aims to accelerate BMM using extrapolation techniques while still ensuring convergence.

Proposed Method: 
- The paper proposes a Block Majorization Minimization method with Extrapolation (BMMe). In each block update, BMMe minimizes a majorizer function evaluated at an extrapolated point instead of the previous iterate.

- A novel adaptive rule is used to update the extrapolation parameters in BMMe. By reformulating BMM as a block mirror descent method with an adaptively updated Bregman divergence, convergence is established for BMMe.

- BMMe is applied to solve NMF with beta-divergences and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Simple multiplicative update rules with extrapolation are derived.

Main Contributions:
- The paper proposes a novel extrapolated BMM method with convergence guarantees for a class of multi-convex problems, using an adaptively updated Bregman divergence. 

- New multiplicative update rules with extrapolation are derived for NMF with beta- and KL-divergences. These rules significantly accelerate standard multiplicative updates.

- Extensive experiments on topic modeling, image and audio datasets empirically demonstrate the acceleration achieved by BMMe over state-of-the-art NMF algorithms.

- The reformulation of BMM as mirror descent provides a new theoretical tool for analyzing and accelerating BMM-type methods for multi-convex optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a block majorization-minimization algorithm with extrapolation for multi-convex optimization and applies it to accelerate multiplicative updates for non-negative matrix factorization problems based on β-divergences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new algorithm called Block Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (BMMe) for solving multi-convex optimization problems. The key contributions are:

1) It introduces an extrapolation step in the block majorization-minimization (BMM) framework to accelerate its convergence. Specifically, each block variable is updated by minimizing a majorizer function evaluated at an extrapolated point, instead of the previous iterate as in standard BMM.

2) It establishes subsequential convergence for BMMe under certain conditions, by reformulating BMM as a block mirror descent method with an adaptively updated Bregman divergence. 

3) It applies BMMe to tackle nonnegative matrix factorization problems with β-divergences for β∈[1,2], leading to multiplicative update algorithms with extrapolation that have convergence guarantees.

4) Through extensive experiments on topic modeling, image and audio datasets, it demonstrates the significant empirical acceleration achieved by BMMe over standard multiplicative updates and state-of-the-art algorithms. For example, on a facial image dataset, it allows the multiplicative updates to converge over twice faster.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction and convergence analysis of an inertial BMM algorithm using extrapolation, with strong empirical performance shown for β-NMF problems.

The paper proposes a block majorization minimization method with extrapolation (BMMe) for solving multi-convex optimization problems. It applies this to tackle NMF problems with $\beta$-divergences for $\beta \in [1,2]$, deriving multiplicative update rules with extrapolation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an adaptive scheme to update the extrapolation parameters in BMMe. Can you explain in more detail how this scheme works and why it is useful? What are some of the theoretical guarantees it provides?

2. BMMe reformulates block MM as a block mirror descent method with an adaptively updated Bregman divergence. Can you walk through the details of this reformulation and explain why it is important for proving convergence? 

3. The convergence analysis relies on establishing a bound on the summability of the Bregman divergence terms (equation 12). Explain the intuition behind why this bound is needed and how it is derived. 

4. How does BMMe exploit the multi-convex structure of the optimization problem? Contrast the assumptions needed for convergence of BMMe versus a more general inertial framework like TITAN.

5. The multiplicative update with extrapolation (MUe) for β-NMF is derived as a special case of BMMe. Walk through the specifics of how the majorizer is constructed and the update rules are obtained. 

6. What is the motivation for using a min-volume regularizer in the application to KL-NMF? Explain how the constraint set ΩW and the regularizer φ1(W) satisfy the required conditions.

7. Derive the details for how the update rule for W is obtained in the case of min-volume KL-NMF. In particular, explain the use of the Lagrangian and how the dual variable μk is determined.  

8. The experiments focus on applications in hyperspectral imaging, topic modeling, and audio source separation. For each area, explain the appropriateness of β-NMF or KL-NMF and discuss the results.

9. The comparison between BMMe and baseline approaches reveal significant empirical speedups on real-world datasets. Analyze the results and characterize when the extrapolation mechanism provides the largest gains. 

10. The paper mentions further work on extensions of BMMe to tensor problems and on relaxing certain theoretical conditions. Elaborate on some specific open questions in these areas that require further investigation.
