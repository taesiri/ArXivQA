# [An Open-World, Diverse, Cross-Spatial-Temporal Benchmark for Dynamic   Wild Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing person re-identification (ReID) benchmarks lack diversity and models trained on them do not generalize well to dynamic real-world scenarios. Benchmarks are collected from limited scenes like campuses, have short data collection periods, small camera networks, and lack nighttime data and identity privacy. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes OWD, an open-world diverse cross-spatial-temporal benchmark for dynamic wild person ReID. OWD has several distinct features:

1) Diverse collection scenes (21 sites): Multiple outdoor and indoor open-world scenes like malls, streets, etc that improve diversity.

2) Diverse lighting: Long time span from day to night captures abundant illumination changes. Real nighttime RGB data is provided.  

3) Diverse statuses: Data collected across all seasons over 2 years from 84 cameras. Covers adverse weather, diverse clothes and poses.

4) Privacy protection: Faces are masked.

5) Rich annotations: ID, camera, scene, temporal, day/night labels allow flexible split for training/evaluation.

The paper also proposes Latent Domain Expansion (LDE) to improve model generalization by decoupling identity and domain features to compute domain statistics for augmenting identity features space.

Main Contributions:

1) OWD benchmark with distinct traits like open-world scenes, real nighttime data, all season collection and privacy protection to promote generalized ReID research.

2) LDE model to implicitly expand domain diversity of identity features using domain statistics for better generalization.  

3) Extensive experiments including cross-dataset evaluation demonstrating OWD's superior transferability over existing benchmarks. Ablations evaluate effectiveness of LDE components.
