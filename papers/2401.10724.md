# [Real-Time Zero-Day Intrusion Detection System for Automotive Controller   Area Network on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Increasing automation and connectivity in vehicles has exposed vulnerabilities in critical in-vehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN). Attacks like denial of service, fuzzing and spoofing can be easily injected due to lack of authentication in CAN.

- Intrusion detection systems (IDS) using machine learning have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, most rely on supervised learning, which cannot detect novel (zero-day) attacks. Some use unsupervised learning but have high latency unsuitable for real-time detection.

- Tight integration of ML-based IDS with ECU functions presents integration challenges in terms of isolation, latency, and energy constraints.

Proposed Solution:

- An unsupervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) based IDS trained only on normal CAN messages to enable zero-day attack detection. 

- Model quantization using Vitis-AI tools from Xilinx targeting resource-constrained Zynq Ultrascale+ platform for IDS-ECU system integration.

- IDS integrated as a custom hardware accelerator (DPU) which acts as a slave peripheral to the ECU through AXI interface. This allows full isolation and control of IDS operation by ECU software.  

- Overlapping IDS operation on chunks of CAN messages with their reception hides detection latency.

Contributions:

- Achieves >=99.5% accuracy in detecting unseen denial of service, fuzzing and spoofing attacks, demonstrating zero-day attack detection ability.

- Tight integration enables line-rate detection speed of 0.43ms per 100 CAN messages to enable real-time threat detection.

- Around 2x reduction in power consumption per inference compared to other ML-IDS techniques, making it suitable for in-vehicle deployment.

- Hardware integration strategy allows efficient consolidation of IDS functionality into ECUs across different network segments.

In summary, the paper presents a novel unsupervised learning based IDS leveraging autoencoders that can detect zero-day attacks on CAN networks in real-time. Smart integration strategies allow such ML-driven security functions to be deployed on resource-constrained automotive grade hardware.
