# [UniCell: Universal Cell Nucleus Classification via Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Nucleus detection and classification in histopathology images is important for cancer diagnosis and grading. 
- Many pathology image datasets exist but have inconsistent annotations, making it difficult to leverage their shared knowledge.
- Existing methods typically train models independently on each dataset, lacking generalization across datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose UniCell, a universal end-to-end nucleus detection and classification framework trainable on multiple datasets concurrently.
- Uses a DETR-based architecture for direct nucleus detection and classification without post-processing.
- Introduces contrastive denoising during training for faster convergence.  
- Proposes a novel Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) that represents each dataset and nucleus category using learnable textual prompts.
- DPM enhances image features using cross-attention between dataset prompts and a category memory bank to exploit their semantic relatedness.
- Allows shared knowledge across datasets to be leveraged in a targeted manner.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end universal nucleus detection and classification method trainable on multiple datasets concurrently.
- Novel Dynamic Prompt Module to align image features with dataset and semantic category information.
- State-of-the-art performance on four nucleus detection/classification benchmarks by effectively utilizing their shared knowledge.
- Universal model requires no separate fine-tuning for different datasets, saving computation time and cost.

In summary, UniCell allows robust multi-dataset learning for nucleus recognition via a dynamic prompt module, outperforming existing dataset-specific models and methods using basic transfer learning.
