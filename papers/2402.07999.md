# [NetInfoF Framework: Measuring and Exploiting Network Usable Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07999)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to address two key challenges when applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to node-attributed graphs:
(1) Measuring whether there is enough usable information in the graph structure and node features for a GNN to perform well on tasks like link prediction and node classification. 
(2) Exploiting any usable information efficiently if present to solve those tasks.

Proposed Solution - NetInfoF Framework:
The paper proposes NetInfoF, a framework consisting of two components - NetInfoF_Probe and NetInfoF_Act.

NetInfoF_Probe:
- Measures the "network usable information" (NUI) in the graph without needing to train any models. 
- Computes a proposed metric called "score" that lower-bounds the accuracy achievable on a task using the graph.
- Represents different components like structure, features, feature propagation through embeddings.
- Score indicates if GNN propagation brings additional information over raw features/structure.

NetInfoF_Act: 
- Exploits NUI if present to solve tasks.
- Shares embedding backbone with NetInfoF_Probe.
- For link prediction, handles heterophily via proposed node similarity adjustment.
- Achieves superior efficiency by having closed form solutions.

Main Contributions:
- Principled metric grounded in information theory to quantify NUI.
- Unified framework applicable to node classification and link prediction.  
- Robust to different graph types exhibited in real-world unlike GNNs.
- Scales linearly in number of edges unlike subgraph GNNs.
- Outperforms GNN baselines in 11 out of 12 datasets on link prediction.
- Identifies ground truth NUI and is sole robust method across graph scenarios.

In summary, the paper presents a novel analysis framework to measure NUI in graphs reliably and exploit it efficiently to match or exceed performance of complex GNN models.
