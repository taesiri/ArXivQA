# [ProbVLM: Probabilistic Adapter for Frozen Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00398)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the question of how to efficiently estimate uncertainty for the embeddings of pre-trained frozen large-scale vision-language models. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. The point estimate embeddings from large frozen VLMs can serve as a good estimate of the mean embedding. Additional parameters of the embedding distribution can be learned efficiently in a post-hoc manner.

2. Learning the additional parameters with objectives enforcing intra-modal and cross-modal alignment will allow capturing ambiguities and uncertainties within and across modalities. 

3. The estimated uncertainties will be well-calibrated and useful for downstream tasks like active learning and model selection.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the uncertainty for frozen VLMs can be estimated post-hoc in an efficient and calibrated manner via intra/cross-modal alignment objectives. This allows retaining the benefits of pre-training while also quantifying uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ProbVLM, a post-hoc probabilistic adapter that efficiently estimates probability distributions for the embeddings of frozen, pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. 

The key ideas are:

- Leveraging existing frozen VLMs that provide high-quality deterministic point estimate embeddings, and estimating the remaining parameters to model the distribution. This avoids needing to retrain large models from scratch.

- Using a combination of intra-modal and cross-modal alignment losses to train ProbVLM to capture ambiguity and uncertainty present within and across modalities.

- Demonstrating that ProbVLM provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates on tasks like cross-modal retrieval, and that the uncertainty can be useful for applications like active learning and model selection.

- Presenting a technique to visualize the predicted embedding distributions using latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient way to convert frozen deterministic VLMs into probabilistic models that quantify uncertainty, without needing large datasets or computing resources. The uncertainty estimates are shown to be useful in downstream applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ProbVLM, a method to efficiently convert the deterministic embeddings from frozen large-scale vision-language models like CLIP into probabilistic embeddings in a post-hoc manner, enabling uncertainty estimation and improved performance on tasks like retrieval, active learning, and model selection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in probabilistic embeddings and uncertainty estimation for vision-language models:

- It proposes a novel method, ProbVLM, to efficiently convert frozen deterministic VLMs like CLIP into probabilistic models in a post-hoc manner, without needing large datasets or retraining. This is different from prior works like PCME and PFE which train probabilistic models from scratch.

- It focuses specifically on estimating uncertainty for cross-modal retrieval tasks using vision-language models. Most prior uncertainty estimation works tackle single modality models. ProbVLM is tailored for the cross-modal nature of VLMs.

- It models the embedding distribution using a heteroscedastic generalized Gaussian, which can capture heavy-tailed distributions. Many prior works assume simpler Gaussian distributions.

- It incorporates both intra-modal and cross-modal objectives to align the means and capture ambiguities across modalities. This is a novel formulation for probabilistic adapters.

- It demonstrates strong calibration of uncertainty estimates on challenging vision-language datasets like COCO, Flickr, CUB and Flowers. The uncertainty translates to predictable performance degradation.

- It shows useful downstream applications of the estimated uncertainties like active learning and model selection. Uncertainty estimation for VLMs has not been explored for such tasks before. 

- It provides interpretability of the embedding uncertainties using latent diffusion models. The visualizations offer insights into the embedding distributions.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel method ProbVLM that efficiently provides well-calibrated and interpretable uncertainties for frozen VLMs. The uncertainties prove useful for various applications, advancing research in this domain.
