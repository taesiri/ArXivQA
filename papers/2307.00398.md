# [ProbVLM: Probabilistic Adapter for Frozen Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00398)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the question of how to efficiently estimate uncertainty for the embeddings of pre-trained frozen large-scale vision-language models. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. The point estimate embeddings from large frozen VLMs can serve as a good estimate of the mean embedding. Additional parameters of the embedding distribution can be learned efficiently in a post-hoc manner.

2. Learning the additional parameters with objectives enforcing intra-modal and cross-modal alignment will allow capturing ambiguities and uncertainties within and across modalities. 

3. The estimated uncertainties will be well-calibrated and useful for downstream tasks like active learning and model selection.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the uncertainty for frozen VLMs can be estimated post-hoc in an efficient and calibrated manner via intra/cross-modal alignment objectives. This allows retaining the benefits of pre-training while also quantifying uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ProbVLM, a post-hoc probabilistic adapter that efficiently estimates probability distributions for the embeddings of frozen, pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. 

The key ideas are:

- Leveraging existing frozen VLMs that provide high-quality deterministic point estimate embeddings, and estimating the remaining parameters to model the distribution. This avoids needing to retrain large models from scratch.

- Using a combination of intra-modal and cross-modal alignment losses to train ProbVLM to capture ambiguity and uncertainty present within and across modalities.

- Demonstrating that ProbVLM provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates on tasks like cross-modal retrieval, and that the uncertainty can be useful for applications like active learning and model selection.

- Presenting a technique to visualize the predicted embedding distributions using latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient way to convert frozen deterministic VLMs into probabilistic models that quantify uncertainty, without needing large datasets or computing resources. The uncertainty estimates are shown to be useful in downstream applications.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

1. Exploring probabilistic embeddings for vision-language models on more tasks beyond cross-modal retrieval, such as image captioning, VQA, classification, detection, and segmentation. The authors suggest that these tasks could also benefit from uncertainty estimation.

2. Applying the proposed ProbVLM method to larger vision-language models like BLIP-2, scaling it to high-resolution inputs, and evaluating the calibrated uncertainties. The authors note that their method is model-agnostic and should be applicable to larger models as well.

3. Extending ProbVLM to the video retrieval task, which is challenging due to increased ambiguity across the modalities over time. The authors cite some prior works applying probabilistic embeddings to video retrieval and suggest this is an interesting future direction.

4. Further analysis and visualization of the predicted embedding distributions, for example by decoding samples using large pre-trained latent diffusion models. The authors demonstrate this idea in a limited capacity in the paper and suggest more work can be done. 

5. Applying calibrated uncertainty estimates to additional downstream applications beyond active learning and model selection. The authors show promising results on those two applications but note the utility of uncertainties for many other applications as well.

6. Comparative studies with more baselines methods as future work develops probabilistic embeddings specifically designed for frozen vision-language models. The authors adapted existing approaches to create baselines for their method.

7. Exploring alternate parameterized distributions beyond the generalized Gaussian distribution used in ProbVLM, to model the embedding uncertainties. The proposed formulation is not tied to a specific distribution.

In summary, the authors propose several promising research directions to build on their work on efficient probabilistic embeddings for frozen vision-language models across applications, models, tasks, analysis, and methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ProbVLM, a method to convert the deterministic embeddings from pre-trained frozen vision-language models like CLIP into probabilistic embeddings in a post-hoc manner. ProbVLM introduces a probabilistic adapter over the image and text encoders of CLIP which predicts the parameters of a heteroscedastic probability distribution for each embedding. It is trained using a combination of intra-modal and cross-modal alignment objectives to ensure the predicted distribution means match the original CLIP embeddings while also capturing ambiguities within and across modalities. Experiments on COCO, Flickr, CUB and Oxford Flowers datasets show ProbVLM provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for image-text retrieval compared to methods like learning covariances or using a soft contrastive loss. The uncertainty estimates enable model selection and active learning for CLIP. A technique is also presented to visualize embedding distributions using samples decoded through Stable Diffusion, indicating they capture meaningful modes of variation. Overall, ProbVLM efficiently retains the benefits of CLIP's pre-training while modeling ambiguity in its embeddings to quantify uncertainty.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called ProbVLM for converting the deterministic embeddings from pre-trained frozen vision-language models like CLIP into probabilistic embeddings in a post-hoc manner. The goal is to leverage the benefits of large-scale pre-training while still being able to model the inherent ambiguity present in images and text. 

The key ideas are 1) to use the existing embeddings from the frozen vision-language model as estimates of the mean of a probability distribution, and then learn the remaining parameters of the distribution using a probabilistic adapter module consisting of separate image and text encoders. The encoders are trained using a combination of intra-modal reconstruction loss and cross-modal alignment loss to capture both within-modality and cross-modality uncertainty. Experiments on image-text retrieval tasks with COCO, Flickr, CUB and Oxford Flowers datasets demonstrate that ProbVLM provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and outperforms baselines. Additional experiments show ProbVLM uncertainties can be useful for model selection and active learning. A technique is also introduced to visualize uncertainty using latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes ProbVLM, a method to estimate probability distributions for the embeddings of pre-trained frozen vision-language models like CLIP in a post-hoc manner. The key ideas are:

1. Leverage the high-quality point estimate embeddings already provided by frozen VLMs like CLIP, and estimate the remaining parameters of a probability distribution around them. The distribution is modeled as a heteroscedastic generalized Gaussian. 

2. Introduce a probabilistic adapter module consisting of lightweight MLPs, one each for image and text. These are trained to predict the parameters of the embedding distribution.

3. The training uses two objectives: (i) Intra-modal alignment, which reconstructs the original embeddings to ensure the predicted mean matches the VLM embedding (ii) Cross-modal alignment, which brings the predicted distributions closer for matched image-text pairs to capture ambiguity. 

4. The uncertainty estimates obtained are shown to be well-calibrated on retrieval tasks. Applications like active learning and model selection are also demonstrated.

5. A technique is proposed to visually interpret the embedding distributions using latent diffusion models.

So in summary, the paper proposes a computationally efficient method to obtain probabilistic embeddings from frozen VLMs by training lightweight adapters guided by intra/cross-modal objectives. The uncertainty estimates are calibrated and useful for downstream tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of deterministic embeddings produced by large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP. Specifically:

- Large vision-language models like CLIP map images and text to fixed vector embeddings in a shared space. 

- However, this deterministic mapping does not capture the inherent ambiguity present in images and text, where a given image/text may map to multiple valid embeddings. 

- The paper proposes ProbVLM, a method to convert the deterministic embeddings from frozen pretrained VLMs into probabilistic embeddings in a post-hoc manner. 

- This allows retaining the benefits of large-scale pretraining while capturing multimodal ambiguity via probability distributions over embeddings.

In summary, the paper is proposing a way to efficiently convert fixed pretrained VLM embeddings into probabilistic embeddings that better capture ambiguity, without needing to retrain large models from scratch.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Probabilistic embeddings - The paper proposes a method to convert the deterministic embeddings from pretrained vision-language models like CLIP into probabilistic embeddings that capture the inherent ambiguity.

- Intra-modal alignment - Aligning the mean of the predicted distribution with the original embedding within each modality. This allows the uncertainty estimates to serve as a proxy for the base model.

- Cross-modal alignment - Enforcing the predicted distributions across modalities to remain close for related concepts. This models the ambiguity arising from one-to-many mappings across modalities. 

- Generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) - The paper models the probabilistic embeddings as heteroscedastic GGDs which can capture heavy-tailed distributions.
