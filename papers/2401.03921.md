# [Design a Metric Robust to Complicated High Dimensional Noise for   Efficient Manifold Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03921)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of denoising data that lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space, in the presence of complex (colored and correlated) noise. Specifically, the data matrix X consists of noisy samples x_i, where the clean samples s_i lie on a smooth d-dimensional manifold M embedded in R^p via an isometric embedding iota. The noise matrix Xi has a separable covariance structure A^{1/2}ZB^{1/2}, where A and B model noise color and correlation respectively. The goal is to denoise each sample to recover the underlying clean samples on the manifold. This is challenging especially when the ambient dimension p is much higher than the sample size n, and the noise level is high.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new algorithm called ROSDOS that designs an optimal local similarity metric to identify true neighbors on the manifold, by combining ideas from Diffusion Maps, ROSELAND landmark diffusion, and Optimal Shrinkage. 

1) Apply ROSELAND landmark diffusion or Optimal Shrinkage globally to get a robust initial metric d_global. 

2) For each sample x_i, find its nearest neighbors using d_global. Apply Optimal Shrinkage locally to this set to design a refined local metric d_local.

3) Use d_local to find the final set of neighbors for each x_i. Take the entrywise median of these neighbors to denoise each sample and recover s_i.

The key intuition is that Optimal Shrinkage can exploit local low-dimensional structure more accurately than using global metrics alone. The combination allows handling complex noise and high ambient dimensions.

Main Contributions:

- New manifold denoising algorithm ROSDOS that provably works under complex high-dimensional noise and compact manifold assumptions.

- Systematic comparison with state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real (LFP) data showing improved performance, especially for ample noise levels.

- Demonstration of a practical use case for removing stimulation artifacts from LFP signals recorded during deep brain stimulation.

In summary, the paper presents a flexible manifold denoising technique and empirically demonstrates its effectiveness in recovering sample points on the manifold under colored, correlated high-dimensional noise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient manifold denoising algorithm called ROSDOS that combines robust metric design using diffusion maps and optimal shrinkage to handle complex high-dimensional noise and recover sample points on low-dimensional manifolds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new manifold denoising algorithm called ROSDOS (RObust and Scalable manifold Denoise with Optimal Shrinkage). The key ideas of ROSDOS are:

1) Designing a robust similarity metric by combining ideas from diffusion maps/ROSELAND and extended optimal shrinkage (eOptShrink). This allows accurate determination of neighbors on the manifold, which is critical for denoising. 

2) Locally approximating the manifold by an affine space and taking the entrywise median of the neighbors to recover each denoised point. 

3) Handling various setups including high ambient dimensions, colored/dependent noise, and manifolds embedded in either high or low dimensional subspaces.

The paper shows through simulations and a real LFP dataset that ROSDOS outperforms other methods, especially in high noise scenarios where determining neighbors is difficult. Theoretical guarantees and more comparisons will be provided in the full paper. Overall, ROSDOS provides an efficient and flexible manifold denoising algorithm applicable to real-world noisy high-dimensional datasets.

The paper proposes a new algorithm called ROSDOS (Robust and Scalable manifold Denoise with Optimal Shrinkage) for manifold denoising, especially in the presence of high dimensional noise with separable covariance structure. It combines techniques like optimal shrinkage, diffusion maps, landmark diffusion, and local metric design. The algorithm is applied to simulated data as well as real-world local field potential data corrupted by stimulus artifacts during deep brain stimulation. So the key terms reflect this focus on manifold denoising, the algorithmic techniques used, the noise models, and the applications.
