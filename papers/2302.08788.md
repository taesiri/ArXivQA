# [MixNeRF: Modeling a Ray with Mixture Density for Novel View Synthesis   from Sparse Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08788)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-quality novel view synthesis from sparse input views. Specifically, the authors propose a method called MixNeRF to address the performance degradation of NeRF models when trained with limited input views. The key ideas are:

1) Modeling the color and density along each ray with a mixture density model. This allows representing complex multimodal distributions and enables more robust learning of scene geometry. 

2) Proposing a new auxiliary task of ray depth estimation. Estimating the depth acts as a useful training objective and supervision signal.

3) Remodeling the color distribution using regenerated blending weights based on the estimated depth. This makes the model more robust to changes in color and viewpoint.

The main hypothesis is that by modeling ray properties using a mixture density model, introducing an auxiliary depth estimation task, and remodeling colors with regenerated blending weights, the model can learn accurate scene geometry and render high-quality novel views from sparse inputs. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MixNeRF over other state-of-the-art approaches.
