# [Semi-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Pseudo Label   Regeneration and BEVMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08009)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores semi-supervised learning (SSL) for class-agnostic motion prediction in autonomous driving systems. The goal is to train high-performance motion prediction models while minimizing the need for expensive manual annotation of training data. The authors adopt a consistency-based self-training framework, where the model makes predictions on unlabeled data to generate pseudo-labels, followed by consistency regularization between predictions on perturbed unlabeled examples and the pseudo-labels. Two main contributions are: (1) A motion selection and re-generation module (MSRM) that effectively filters unreliable pseudo-labels and re-generates them from reliable neighbors, improving pseudo-label quality. (2) Two efficient data augmentations tailored for motion prediction - Temporal-Sampling (TS) which simulates faster motion by sub-sampling input frames, and BEVMix which mixes two sequences while maintaining motion trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate that by using just 1-10% labeled data plus unlabeled data, the semi-supervised approach substantially improves over self-supervised methods and achieves comparable performance to some fully supervised techniques. The method provides an favorable trade-off between annotation cost and performance for motion prediction.
