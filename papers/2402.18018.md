# [Communication Efficient ConFederated Learning: An Event-Triggered SAGA   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard federated learning (FL) systems with a single server can only support a limited number of users, degrading learning capability. Decentralized FL requires device-to-device communication which may not be feasible.

- Existing algorithms for confederated learning (CFL) with multiple edge servers suffer from either sublinear convergence or lack of communication efficiency. Reducing communication overhead is crucial for CFL with a massive number of users.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a stochastic gradient algorithm called CFL-SAGA for communication-efficient confederated learning over a network of edge servers. 

- A conditionally-triggered user selection (CTUS) mechanism is introduced to reduce uplink communication overhead. CTUS uses a triggering condition to select only a small subset of users to upload informative gradients, without compromising convergence rate.

- The aggregated gradient at each server uses a combination of newly uploaded gradients and stale gradients from unselected users. This reusing of stale gradients ensures fast linear convergence despite breaking unbiasedness of the gradient estimate.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis proving that CFL-SAGA enjoys fast linear convergence rate even with limited user participation per iteration.

- Introduction of an innovative CTUS technique for confederated learning that uses a triggering condition involving neighbor server variables to determine which users should upload gradients.

- Rigorous analysis showing the proposed CTUS technique can effectively prune non-informative user gradient uploads under mild conditions.

- Empirical results demonstrating CFL-SAGA achieves substantially higher communication efficiency compared to baselines including GT-SAGA, CFL-ADMM, GT-SVRG and GT-SARAH.

In summary, the key innovation is an event-triggered user selection approach tailored for confederated learning to minimize communication overhead while ensuring fast linear convergence. Both theoretical and empirical results validate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.
