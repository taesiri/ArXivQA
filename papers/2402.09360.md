# [HiRE: High Recall Approximate Top-$k$ Estimation for Efficient LLM   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive decoding with large language models (LLMs) is very slow on accelerators like GPUs/TPUs as it is memory bound - most of the time is spent transferring model parameters from high bandwidth memory to cache. 
- Recent works show LLMs can maintain quality with sparsity in feedforward (FFN) layers by using only top-k fractions of rows/columns where kâ‰ˆ0.05. This suggests a way to reduce parameter transfers and hence latency. 
- But exploiting this sparsity is hindered as identifying top-k rows/columns requires full matrix operations, limiting potential gains.

Proposed Solution - HiRE:
- Proposes HiRE - High Recall Approximate Top-k Estimation with two key ideas:
   1. A compression scheme to cheaply predict top-k rows/columns with high recall, followed by exact computation on just the predicted subset.
   2. DaT-Top-k - an efficient multi-device approximate top-k operator.

Key Contributions:

1. HiRE-Softmax: Applies HiRE to softmax layer 
   - Uses low-rank approximation and aggressive quantization to predict top-k
   - Gives 1.22x speedup on 1B parameter model without quality drop
   
2. HiRE-FFN: Applies HiRE to FFN layer
   - Proposes group sparsity with small groups for efficiency  
   - Exploits static and dynamic overlap in activations across tokens
   - Gives 1.16x speedup without quality drop
   
3. DaT-Top-k: Efficient distributed top-k operator  
   - Performs approximate top-k locally on each device
   - Avoids communication costs of exact global top-k
   - Gives 2.27x speedup over vanilla HiRE on 4 TPUs  
   
4. Together HiRE-Softmax + HiRE-FFN give 1.47x end-to-end speedup on 1 TPU with matched accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces \herd, a method to efficiently estimate the top-$k$ outputs in transformer softmax and feedforward layers using approximate computations followed by exact top-$k$ selection, demonstrating improved inference latency with minimal loss in accuracy on large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing \herd, a method for efficient approximate top-$k$ estimation in large language models, consisting of:

- An estimation method to cheaply predict top-$k$ rows/columns of softmax/FFN layers with high recall, followed by exact computation on just the predicted subset. This uses techniques like low-rank approximations and aggressive quantization.

- \distop - an efficient distributed approximate top-$k$ operator to enable \herd in a multi-device serving setting.

2) Applying \herd to both softmax (\herdsm) and feedforward (\herdffn) layers of a large language model, demonstrating almost matching accuracy but 1.47x faster inference on a TPU compared to the dense baseline. Key ideas that enable quality preservation and greater speedups are: promoting group sparsity in FFN layers and exploiting static and dynamic overlap of activations across tokens/samples.

So in summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end method and optimizations called \herd to efficiently exploit sparsity and perform approximate top-$k$ computation in large language models, while preserving accuracy. This enables faster inference on accelerators.

The paper introduces HiRE, a method to efficiently estimate the top-k elements of activations in the softmax and feedforward layers of large language models, while maintaining high recall. This allows faster autoregressive decoding by only computing on the estimated top subset, providing speedups in inference without losing accuracy. Key ideas include using aggressive quantization and low-rank projections for approximation, exploiting group sparsity and activation overlap, and a distributed approximate top-k operator (\distop). The techniques are evaluated on large models with up to a billion parameters and shown to provide substantial improvements in inference latency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a high recall approximate top-k estimation procedure. Can you elaborate on why having high recall is critical for the proposed method to work? How does recall tradeoff with efficiency?

2) The paper introduces a distributed approximate top-k operator called DA-TOP-k. Can you explain why the standard top-k operator is inefficient in a distributed setting and how DA-TOP-k aims to alleviate that?

3) The paper shows substantial gains from applying group sparsity, even with very small group sizes like 8, to the feedforward layer. Can you analyze the hardware efficiency trends that make group sparsity particularly suited for accelerators compared to unstructured sparsity?

4) The method proposes exploiting static and dynamic overlap of activations across tokens. Can you conceptually explain what is meant by static and dynamic overlap and how the method aims to leverage these?

5) Can you analyze the comparative benefits and downsides of using low rank approximations versus aggressive quantization for the approximate top-k estimation? When would you prefer one over the other?

6) The paper demonstrates the efficacy of HiRE for both softmax and feedforward layers. Can you think of how the ideas could be extended to also improve the efficiency of attention layers? What may be some challenges there?

7) The paper evaluates efficiency using parameter size as a proxy. Can you think of cases or settings where this proxy may not accurately reflect true end-to-end latency gains? 

8) The method requires retraining models with explicit top-k operations. How do you think this would this impact the training efficiency and carbon footprint? Are there ways to mitigate that?

9) Can you conceptually compare and contrast the approach with mixture-of-experts based models for efficient inference? What are relative pros and cons?

10) The paper targets autoregressive decoding which is memory bound. Can you explain why and discuss settings other than autoregressive decoding where the ideas may or may not be as impactful?
