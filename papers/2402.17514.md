# [Robust Unsupervised Crowd Counting and Localization with Adaptive   Resolution SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17514)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing crowd counting methods require large amounts of labeled data which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Therefore, there is a need for unsupervised crowd counting methods that can work effectively without manual annotations. However, current unsupervised methods have limited performance, especially in high-density crowd images.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a robust unsupervised crowd counting framework utilizing pseudo-labels from a Segmentation Anything Model (SAM). To enhance SAM's ability to detect small, occluded people in crowds, an adaptive resolution strategy (AdaSEEM) is introduced which iteratively zooms into uncertain regions and re-segments them at higher resolutions. 

To generate point pseudo-labels for counting, a robust localization method is developed based on modeling the mask distribution as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and selecting the lower Gaussian mean as the head location. 

A counting network is then trained using both the mask and point pseudo-labels, with a custom loss function that excludes uncertain regions to improve reliability.

Finally, an iterative pseudo-label refinement technique leverages count predictions to prompt AdaSEEM to generate additional masks for missing people, further boosting performance.

Main Contributions:

- Propose AdaSEEM with an adaptive resolution inference strategy to enhance segmentation of small, occluded individuals in crowds

- Introduce a robust pseudo-point localization method using GMMs to fit the mask distribution  

- Develop a robust loss function for effectively utilizing both mask and point pseudo-labels  

- Formulate an iterative technique to continuously improve pseudo-labels quality using network predictions

- Achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised counting performance, even rivaling some supervised methods
