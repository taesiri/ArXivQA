# [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we improve the performance and generalization abilities of large language models through instruction finetuning?

The key aspects the paper explores regarding this question are:

- Scaling the number of instructional tasks used in finetuning
- Scaling the size of the model being finetuned 
- Adding chain-of-thought style reasoning tasks to the finetuning data

The overall hypothesis seems to be that combining all three of these factors - using a very large model, finetuning it on a large and diverse set of tasks including reasoning tasks, and posing those tasks as natural language instructions - will produce significant gains in the model's capabilities on a variety of NLP benchmarks, especially ones requiring reasoning.

The experiments aim to validate whether each factor individually, and their combination, does indeed improve performance and generalization. The results generally support the hypothesis, showing gains from scaling model size, scaling number of tasks, and incorporating reasoning-style tasks.

So in summary, the central research question is how to improve language models via instruction finetuning, and the key factors explored are scale of model, scale of data, and inclusion of reasoning tasks. The hypothesis is that combining all these factors will produce the best results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Scaling instruction-finetuning of language models by increasing the number of finetuning tasks and the size of the model. The paper shows that both increasing model size and number of finetuning tasks improves performance on a variety of held-out evaluation benchmarks. 

- Studying the effect of including chain-of-thought (CoT) examples in the finetuning data. The paper finds that including CoT data improves performance on reasoning tasks while maintaining gains on non-CoT tasks. It also enables zero-shot reasoning without exemplars.

- Showing the generality of instruction finetuning by applying it to models of different sizes and architectures, including T5, PaLM, and U-PaLM. Instruction finetuning improves all models tested.

- Releasing Flan-T5 models that achieve strong few-shot performance compared to much larger models like PaLM 62B.

- Demonstrating the improved usability of instruction-finetuned models via human evaluations on open-ended generation.

In summary, the main contributions are showing that instruction finetuning is a general method to improve model performance and usability, especially when scaling the number of tasks, scaling model size, and including chain-of-thought data. The results also underscore the compute-efficiency of instruction finetuning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper explores instruction finetuning of large language models by scaling the number of finetuning tasks, scaling model size, and finetuning with chain-of-thought data, showing improved performance across a variety of models, prompting setups, and evaluation benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Scale of models: This paper explores instruction finetuning on very large language models, up to 540B parameters (Flan-PaLM). Most prior work has focused on smaller models, like 11B or 137B. Studying instruction finetuning at this unprecedented scale provides new insights.

- Number of finetuning tasks: This paper uses a large number of finetuning tasks (1,836) compared to prior work, which has typically used dozens to hundreds of tasks. Scaling the number of tasks provides information on how performance changes.

- Inclusion of reasoning tasks: A key contribution is showing that finetuning on chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets improves performance on reasoning evaluations. Previous instruction finetuning focused more on traditional NLP tasks.

- Generality across models: This paper shows instruction finetuning benefits several model architectures (e.g. decoder-only like PaLM vs encoder-decoder like T5) and objectives (e.g. causal LM vs span corruption). Prior work focused on one model at a time.

- Strong empirical gains: The paper demonstrates large gains from instruction finetuning over strong baselines across evaluations. For example, Flan-PaLM outperforms PaLM by 9.4% on average on held-out benchmarks.

- Public model releases: The paper releases Flan-T5 models of various sizes, which outperform prior T5 checkpoints. This enables broader access and research.

Overall, this paper provides significant evidence that instruction finetuning is a general method to improve language models, through comprehensive experiments and analysis. It pushes forward the scale and techniques compared to related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Continue scaling the size of models and the number of finetuning tasks. The scaling curves in the paper suggest that larger models and more finetuning data will likely continue to improve performance.

- Explore additional techniques like UL2R that can complement instruction finetuning to further improve models without requiring more scale or data. The authors showed that combining UL2R pretraining and instruction finetuning yielded the best model.

- Do more investigation into the tradeoffs between scaling model size versus scaling finetuning data. It is still unclear if one is more important than the other.

- Study if specialized models finetuned on specific domains or tasks can outperform general instruction finetuned models. The authors acknowledge models like ByT5 outperformed on some specialized benchmarks.

- Evaluate the effectiveness of instruction finetuning for single task finetuning. The authors did not directly study this but suggest it may also help.

- Continue developing better benchmarks, especially for evaluating reasoning, robustness, and open-ended capabilities beyond standard NLP.

- Explore societal impacts and limitations of these models, and assess potential harms and biases. The authors acknowledge many important limitations.

In summary, the main directions are to scale up even further, combine instruction finetuning with other methods, develop better benchmarks, and thoroughly evaluate societal impacts. The overall goal is to produce models with more robust and generalizable capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper scales instruction finetuning of language models by increasing the number of finetuning tasks, increasing model size, and including chain-of-thought data. Experiments on PaLM, T5, and U-PaLM models show that instruction finetuning substantially improves performance on a variety of NLP benchmarks, especially for reasoning tasks. Key results include:

- Scaling the number of finetuning tasks from 282 to 1,836 and model size from 8B to 540B parameters improves performance, suggesting further gains from more scaling.

- Including just 9 chain-of-thought datasets in finetuning maintains reasoning ability, unlike finetuning without it which hurts reasoning.

- Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art on MMLU (75.2%), MGSM (72.0%), and other benchmarks by leveraging reasoning and self-consistency.

- Flan-T5 models strong zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought abilities, even outperforming much larger models like PaLM 62B. 

- Flan models show substantially better open-ended generation judged by human raters and reduced toxicity.

Overall, instruction finetuning is shown to be a general method for improving language model performance across a range of model sizes, architectures, and evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper describes a method for scaling instruction-finetuned language models. The key ideas are:

1. Scaling the number of finetuning tasks to 1,836 tasks across 473 datasets and 146 task categories. Prior work used fewer tasks like 80 tasks. Scaling the number of tasks improves performance on held-out evaluations.

2. Scaling the model size up to 540 billion parameters. Experiments show that increasing model scale substantially improves performance on held-out tasks for both finetuned and non-finetuned models. 

3. Finetuning on chain-of-thought (CoT) data in addition to standard supervised learning tasks. They show that finetuning on CoT examples is critical for maintaining strong reasoning abilities on held-out CoT evaluations. The final finetuning mixture includes both CoT and non-CoT tasks.

4. Applying instruction finetuning to multiple model families - PaLM, T5, U-PaLM - showing it is a general technique. The best overall model combines instruction finetuning and U-PaLM's unsupervised pretraining.

5. Releasing Flan-T5 models that outperform prior T5 checkpoints on challenging evaluations like reasoning, even compared to much larger models.

Overall, the paper shows instruction finetuning is an effective technique to improve model performance and usability across a range of few-shot, zero-shot, and reasoning evaluations. Key results are new state-of-the-art on benchmarks like MMLU and strong qualitative improvements in open-ended generation.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper focuses on instruction finetuning, which involves finetuning language models on tasks framed as natural language instructions, as a technique to improve model performance and generalization. The authors advance instruction finetuning by scaling up three key aspects: (1) the number of finetuning tasks, increasing to 1,836 tasks total across a variety of datasets, (2) the size of the model, applying instruction finetuning to model sizes up to 540 billion parameters, and (3) including chain-of-thought style tasks and data formatting to enable stronger reasoning abilities. The resulting instruction-finetuned models, termed Flan-PaLM and Flan-T5, achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks like MMLU and BIG-Bench across various prompting strategies, demonstrating substantially improved capabilities over baseline models without instruction finetuning. Overall, the central method advanced is scaling up instruction finetuning along multiple dimensions to significantly enhance language model performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper scales instruction finetuning along three dimensions: model size, number of tasks, and inclusion of chain-of-thought (CoT) data. How might further scaling along each of these dimensions affect model performance? What are the potential limitations or drawbacks of extreme scaling?

2. The authors find that increasing model size and number of finetuning tasks both substantially improve performance. However, the gains from additional tasks seem to diminish after around 282 tasks. What could explain this diminishing return? How might the authors modify the task curation to obtain larger gains from more tasks? 

3. The inclusion of CoT data during finetuning is critical for maintaining strong reasoning abilities, as shown in Figure 3. However, the amount of CoT data used is quite small (only 9 datasets). How much and what types of CoT data may be needed to further improve reasoning performance? How could the CoT data be made more diverse?

4. The paper focuses on evaluation on unseen tasks, arguing this demonstrates generalization. However, the training tasks have substantial overlap with pretraining data in some cases. Could the results be partially explained by "memorization" rather than generalization? How could the authors better assess generalization?

5. Flan-PaLM exhibits strong empirical performance, achieving state-of-the-art on several benchmarks. However, the method itself is quite simple. What ingredients are most critical to its success? Could equally strong or better results be achieved with alternative methods?

10. The flanpalm human evaluation results are far from expert-level performance, as shown in Table 1. What are the key weaknesses of the method, and what innovations are needed to achieve more robust human-level intelligence?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores scaling instruction finetuning, a technique that finetunes language models on diverse tasks framed as natural language instructions to improve few-shot learning on unseen tasks. They scale instruction finetuning along three dimensions: number of finetuning tasks (to 1.8K), model size (up to 540B parameters), and inclusion of chain-of-thought data. Across T5, PaLM, and U-PaLM models, scaling instruction finetuning substantially boosts performance on evaluations like MMLU, BIG-Bench, TyDiQA, and multilingual math problems. Scaling the model size and number of finetuning tasks both independently improve performance. Including chain-of-thought data maintains strong reasoning ability that is otherwise degraded by finetuning without it. The resulting Flan-PaLM model establishes new SOTA on benchmarks, improves open-ended generation, and even benefits from instruction finetuning at just 0.2% of the pretraining compute. Overall, scaling instruction finetuning produces significant capability gains across diverse evaluations while retaining computational efficiency relative to pretraining.
