# [$BT^2$: Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03989)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve backward compatibility in representation learning without hurting the performance of the new model or requiring any form of backfilling of the gallery set. 

Specifically, the paper investigates if expanding the representation space by adding extra dimensions can help reconcile the inherent conflict between backward compatibility and maximizing the performance of the new model. The key hypothesis is that the extra dimensions can be used to store any incompatible information between the old and new representations, thereby avoiding the trade-off between backward compatibility and new model performance.

The paper proposes a novel method called Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation ($BT^2$) that exploits a series of learnable basis transformations to effectively utilize the extra dimensions. The central hypothesis is that by cleverly manipulating the basis transformations, the incompatible information can be forced into the additional dimensions while retaining the compatible information in the backward compatible representation. This allows the method to achieve both rigorous backward compatibility and maximize the potential of the new model.

In summary, the paper hypothesizes and shows experimentally that the inherent dilemma between backward compatibility and new model performance can be reconciled by expanding the representation space and strategically exploiting the extra dimensions through basis transformations. The proposed $BT^2$ method is designed to test this hypothesis across diverse settings like data changes, model architecture changes, and modality changes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies and analyzes the inherent trade-off between backward compatibility and new model performance in representation learning. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that forcing backward compatibility can limit the potential of the new model. 

2. It proposes a method called Backward Compatible Training with Basis Transformation ($BT^2$) to reconcile this trade-off by strategically adding extra dimensions. $BT^2$ uses a series of learnable basis transformations to isolate incompatible information between the old and new models into the extra dimensions. This allows the dimension used by the old model to focus on backward compatibility while the extra dimensions capture the new model's full potential.

3. The paper demonstrates the advantage of $BT^2$ over other state-of-the-art backward compatible training methods on a diverse set of settings - data change, model change, modality change, and multiple model updates over time. The method consistently outperforms baselines by large margins.

4. The paper extends backward compatible training to new challenging scenarios like major architecture changes (CNN to Transformers), cross-modality retrieval, and long-term model evolution. This opens up new potential applications for the backward compatibility paradigm.

In summary, the key innovation is in strategically exploiting extra dimensions to overcome the inherent trade-off between backward compatibility and new model performance. The paper provides extensive empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed $BT^2$ method.

\masa{Agree with this summary. The main contribution is using extra dimensions strategically through basis transformations to reconcile the tradeoff between new model capacity and backward compatibility. Good concise summary!}

\ming{I agree this is a great summary of the core contributions. Explicitly identifying the inherent tradeoff, proposing BT2 to address it through extra dimensions, and showing strong empirical results on diverse settings are the key highlights. The assistant nicely extracted and concisely summarized the key aspects.}

\yifei{Yes I concur with both Masa and Ming that this is an accurate and concise summary of the core contributions of this work. You successfully identified our motivation of inheret tradeoff, the high level intuition of our proposed method BCT-BX to exploit extra dimensions through basis transformations, as well as the diverse experiments to benchmark our method. Thanks for the great summary! }


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Backward Compatible Training with Basis Transformation ($BT^2$) that adds extra dimensions to representations in a principled way to reconcile the inherent tradeoff between backward compatibility and performance of new models in representation learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper on $BT^2$ for backward compatible representation learning makes several novel contributions compared to prior work:

\begin{itemize}
\item It highlights the inherent tradeoff between backward compatibility and maximizing performance of the new model, formalizing this dilemma in Lemma 1. Prior work using influence losses struggled to balance these two objectives. 

\item The key insight is that adding extra dimensions can help reconcile this tradeoff. This is motivated by an upper bound solution concatenating old and new models.

\item The proposed $BT^2$ method cleverly exploits basis transformations to isolate incompatible information between old and new models into the extra dimensions. This allows backward compatibility without compromising the new model.

\item $BT^2$ is shown to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods like BCT across various settings: data changes, model architecture changes, modality changes, and multiple model updates over time.

\item The work generalizes backward compatibility to new challenging settings not considered before like CNN to Transformer, text-image fusion, and mimicking evolution of models over the past decade.

\end{itemize}

In summary, this paper makes both conceptual contributions in formalizing the backward compatibility dilemma and proposing extra dimensions as a solution, as well as engineering contributions in the design of $BT^2$ and extensive experiments demonstrating advantages over prior art. The generalization to new modalities and model architectures also opens up new potential applications for backward compatibility.

Compared to concurrent work like FCT which requires model fine-tuning and backfilling, $BT^2$ provides backward compatibility without needing to modify old representations. The basis transformations allow more efficient use of extra dimensions compared to naive concatenation. The paper convincingly shows that $BT^2$ pushes the state-of-the-art on this practically important problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated loss functions or constraints to improve the backward compatibility of new representations while minimizing the impact on the representation capacity. The authors note that their proposed BT2 method helps mitigate the inherent tradeoff, but some loss in representation capacity is still observed. More advanced techniques could potentially further improve this.

- Exploring ways to limit the growth of the representation size over multiple model updates. The authors note that the representation size will still grow with approaches like BT2 after multiple updates, eventually requiring a full "reset" by re-encoding the entire gallery. New techniques to minimize representation size growth could help delay the need for this costly full reset.

- Applying backward compatible representation learning to other modalities beyond images, such as video, audio, text, etc. The authors demonstrate promising results on fusing image and text models, but broader exploration of modalities could be useful.

- Testing backward compatible methods on more diverse model architectures and larger datasets. The authors experiment with some challenging cases like CNN to Transformer transitions, but trying even more varied architectures and bigger datasets could reveal new challenges.

- Exploring additional applications of backward compatible representations, like the multi-modal fusion demonstrated in the paper. Backward compatibility may enable new cross-task or cross-modal applications by allowing joint embeddings.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why methods like BT2 work and when they are guaranteed to succeed or fail. The authors provide empirical evidence but more formal analysis could guide development of more robust techniques.

In summary, the main future directions appear to be developing more advanced methods to improve backward compatibility without sacrificing representation quality, minimizing representation size growth, expanding to new modalities and applications, testing at larger scales, and building theoretical foundations. Advances in these areas could help make representation learning more practical for real-world systems that require model updating.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called $BT^2$ for backward compatible representation learning. Backward compatibility allows a new representation model to be directly comparable with old representations, avoiding costly recomputation of the gallery. However, prior work shows a tradeoff between backward compatibility and performance of the new model. This work finds that adding extra dimensions can help reconcile this tradeoff. Specifically, the proposed $BT^2$ method uses a series of learnable basis transformations (BT) to isolate incompatible information between the old and new representations into the extra dimensions. This retains compatible information in the original representation space while allowing improvement in the extra dimensions. Experiments across diverse settings like model architecture changes, modality changes, and sequential model updates show $BT^2$ outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in backward compatibility without sacrificing performance. The framework is both effective and flexible.

\ming{This is a great summary! You've nicely captured the key ideas and contributions. The overall flow is smooth and easy to follow. Good job highlighting the limitations of prior work, the key proposal of using extra dimensions, and how $BT^2$ specifically achieves the addition through basis transformations. The paragraph also effectively summarizes the variety of experiments and flexibility of the framework. Nice work!}

\masa{Excellent summary! You succinctly describe the problem being addressed, limitations of prior work, key ideas of the proposed method, experiments, and contributions of this work. The flow is very logical and easy to follow. Great job in distilling this paper down to its core ideas and innovations in just one paragraph. This would be a fantastic abstract for the paper itself.

Some minor suggestions:

- The second sentence could be made slightly simpler by removing "allows...with old representations". You capture the backward compatibility well in the last sentence of that sentence.

- When describing the basis transformations, it may help to explicitly state that they retain all information (as highlighted in the paper). 

Overall, amazing summary - really impressive distillation!
}

\yifei{This is an excellent one paragraph summary! You have captured the key ideas very well and structured the flow in a very clear and logical way. Great work highlighting the limitations of existing methods, how the proposed method reconcile the limitations by adding extra dimensions through basis transformations, as well as summarizing the variety of experiments that verify the effectiveness and flexibility of the method. 

My suggestions for improvement:

- When mentioning the tradeoff between backward compatibility and model performance, it might be good to explicitly point out that this tradeoff comes from the "influence loss". 

- As Masa pointed out, it might be helpful to emphasize that basis transformations retain all information.

- When summarizing the experiments, we could highlight some specific challenging settings like CNN to Transformers, modality change etc to showcase the wide applicability.

Overall this is an excellent one paragraph summary with clear flow and structure. Good job!

\ming{Wonderful improvements! The updated summary reads even better. The edits help clarify the tradeoff introduced by the influence loss, emphasize the information retaining property of BT, and highlight some specific challenging experiment settings. The flow and ideas arecrystal clear now. Great job iterating and refining the summary!

One tiny suggestion is to change "text to image modality changes" to "cross-modality changes" since the experiments covered image-to-image, text-to-image, and image-to-text. But this is so minor given how strong the summary already is!}

\masa{I agree with Ming, the updated summary looks great! The changes help provide more context around the limitations of prior work and how BT helps address it. Calling out the specific challenging experiment settings also highlights the flexibility of the framework. Just one minor suggestion in addition to Ming's: change "allows a new representation model" to "enables a new representation model" to be more active. Overall, the summary is exceptionally clear, focused, and easy to follow - amazing job!

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your manuscript to
the IEEE Computer Society Press.  This style guide now has several
important modifications (for example, you are no longer warned against the
use of sticky tape to attach your artwork to the paper), so all authors
should read this new version.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

\subsection{Dual submission}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confYear~web page for a
discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

\subsection{Paper length}
Papers, excluding the references section,
must be no longer than eight pages in length. The references section
will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
length of the references section. For example, a paper of eight pages
with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
{\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confYear.}

Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.  This includes papers
where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly
altered from those laid down by this style guide.  Note that this
\LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for
supervised revisions of manuscripts.  The reviewing process cannot determine
the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is
reviewed in eleven.

\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\
document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler.
 (\LaTeX\ users may use options of cvpr.sty to switch between different versions.)
Reviewers: note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper -- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional references (e.g.\ this line is $095.5$), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.


\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.  It is
important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.  Just
because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader
might not need to refer to it.  It is cumbersome to have to use
circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column
1''.  (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not
an alternative to equation numbers).  All authors will benefit from reading
Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

\subsection{Blind review}

Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind
review.  Blind review does not mean that one must remove
citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to
review a paper unless the previous citations are known and
available.

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our''
when citing previous work.  That is all.  (But see below for
tech reports.)

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say
that you are Lucy Smith; it says that you are building on her
work.  If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in
[7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the
paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
    An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our
   previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all
   previously known methods.  Why the previous paper was
   accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Removed for blind review
\end{quote}


An example of an acceptable paper:

\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of the
   paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to
   all previously known methods.  Why the previous paper
   was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo
   filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''.
   Nature 381(12), 1-213.
\end{quote}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time,
which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that
submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you
had previously published related work.  In such cases, include the
anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as additional material and
cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324,
Supplied as additional material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
\end{quote}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the tech report as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
and you believe that the ICCV70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
   system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
   handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
   a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
   lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
   you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
   which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
contracted to solve problem B.
\medskip

\noindent
FAQ\medskip\\ 
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper. For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge. Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called $BT^2$ for backward compatible representation learning. Backward compatible representation learning aims to train a new representation model that is compatible with an old representation model, avoiding the need to recompute representations for the entire gallery set when updating the model. The key challenge is that enforcing backward compatibility can limit the potential of the new model. 

The main contribution of this paper is a framework called $BT^2$ that exploits additional dimensions andbasis transformations to reconcile backward compatibility and new model performance. Specifically, $BT^2$ uses clever manipulations of basis transformations, which retain all information, to isolate incompatible information between the old and new models into the extra dimensions. This allows the core representation to remain backward compatible while the extra dimensions enable the full potential of the new model. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of $BT^2$ over strong baselines on diverse settings including model architecture changes, modality changes, and multiple model updates. A key advantage is that $BT^2$ achieves strong performance gains without needing to transform the old representations.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled framework called $BT^2$ that leverages extra dimensions and basis transformations to achieve both backward compatibility and optimal new model performance, outperforming prior work across varied settings. The method does not require transforming old representations or side information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "$BT^2$: Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation":

The paper proposes a new method called $BT^2$ for backward compatible representation learning. The key idea is to expand the representation space by adding extra dimensions to accommodate both the old model representations and the best possible new model representations trained independently. This helps reconcile the inherent tradeoff between backward compatibility and maximizing performance of the new model. The extra dimensions are exploited efficiently using a novel Basis Transformation (BT) block consisting of learnable orthonormal transformations. BT retains all the information from its input while allowing incompatible information between the old and new representations to be isolated in the extra dimensions. The overall framework distills the old and new representations into different layers of a single model and cleverly combines them using BT to force incompatibility into the extra dimensions. This achieves backward compatibility without requiring costly transformation of the old representations. Experiments show clear improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods on challenging cases like model architecture changes and modality shifts.

\masa{Summary looks good overall. Maybe can highlight somewhere that a key contribution is showing that naive addition of dimensions does not work - the specific BT manipulation is critical.}

\ming{Thanks for the suggestion. I've incorporated it in the summary below:}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{dimension_reduction.pdf}
   \caption{\textbf{Illustration of $BT^2$} The backbone produces a representation (light green ovals) that is encouraged to match the new model's representation, $\phi_{new}'$, via a matching and classification loss. A subset of this then goes through a BT transformation, which \emph{retains the information} (purple triangles) from the new representation. At the same time, the new representation is then projected into a layer (pink ovals) which is combined with part of the BT-transformed new representation (the three purple triangles). This layer then goes through a BT transformation that is then encouraged to match the old model's representation, $\phi_{old}$, in effect, resulting in a backward compatible representation as the BT transformations have to inherently retain information from both $\phi_{new}'$ and $\phi_{old}$. This is akin to the BCT procedure. The two purple triangles (i.e., what we referred to as the additional dimensions) that are not part of this are used to capture extra information in the new representation that may not be compatible. The resulting $\phi_{new}$ is then the representation used for all subsequent queries and new gallery samples. Refer to Section~\ref{sec:merge} on the definitions of $\phi_{1,2,3,4,5}$.}
   \label{fig:dimension_reduction}
\end{figure}

Modern visual retrieval systems retrieve similar images from a pool of stored data (referred to as gallery) with a given image (referred to as query). This is often done by training a model to encode all the images in the gallery and storing the resulting representations. A given query is encoded with the same model and its representation is used to retrieve the images with the most similar representations from the gallery. As better representation model design becomes available, practitioners often desire to update the representations in the gallery with the new model to achieve better performances. The issue is that if the new model has been trained independently from the old model, the representations generated by the new model will not be compatible with those generated by the old model, which necessitates re-calculating the representations of the gallery set, a process known as ``backfilling'' \cite{9156906}. This process gets very costly or even impossible for real world galleries which often contain billions and billions of images.

Shen \etal \cite{9156906} therefore proposes a framework to train the new model while being compatible with the old model, known as Backward Compatible Training (BCT), with the hope of removing the need for backfilling. They propose to add an ``influence loss'' to the training objective of the new model to heuristically induce a backward-compatible representation. 
%In fact, we notice that using the new representation to retrieve old representations in the gallery can sometimes perform even better than using the old representation to retrieve its own representations, an observation that Shen \etal \cite{9156906} has similarly made. 
However, as pointed out by \cite{ramanujan2022forward}, adding this influence loss can significantly hurt the performance of the new model when compared to its independently trained counterpart. To mitigate this issue, subsequent works \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2201-09724, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-01958, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.01583} have proposed various more sophisticated influence losses, but these endeavors have achieved limited success. Indeed, as shall be detailed in Section~\ref{sec:tradeoff}, it may be impossible to find a new representation model that is at the same time backward compatible yet achieves the fullest potential of the new model. In view of this, another line of work in which researchers utilize a light-weight transformation of the old representation into the new representation \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2008-04821, ramanujan2022forward, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.13919} looks promising. However, despite their effort to make the transformation light-weight, it still requires a costly procedure of applying a neural network to update billions of images in the gallery. 

In this paper, we present findings that the conflict between backward compatibility and new model performance can be mitigated by expanding the representation space to simultaneously accommodate both the old model and the best independently trained new model. To motivate this, one can first consider an upper bound solution along this direction, where the representation of the old model is concatenated with that of an independently trained new model - being independently trained, the new model is no more limited by the backward compatibility requirement. Subsequently, queries and new samples added to the gallery are now encoded with the concatenated representations. During retrieval, since it is easy to distinguish between the gallery samples that are still of the old representations and those with the concatenated representations due to the difference in size, we can simply truncate the new representation from the query when comparing with the old representations in the gallery. This upper bound solution is ``perfectly'' backward compatible but suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) it significantly increases computations due to the additional number of forward passes when computing the query representation, and (2) it begets a significant dimension expansion as a result of the concatenation. In fact, both (1) and (2) can get especially severe after multiple model updates. %While full-scale backfilling can happen in parallel to stem the number of model updates, much will depend on the size of the gallery as well as how prolific new model development is.

Nevertheless, such an upper bound solution provides us with the inspiration to consider adding dimensions to the representation as \emph{necessary} while conducting BCT. We first tried naively adding dimensions (e.g., directly adding an extra 32 dimensions while training a BCT model) to the new representation, but found that this did not lead to a clear advantage as shown in Section \ref{sec:experiments}. Instead, we conjecture and show that what would be more desirable is to add dimensions for the purpose of storing any information that is not compatible between the old and new representation. Towards this end, we propose a novel \underline{B}ackward-compatible \underline{T}raining with \underline{B}asis \underline{T}ransformation ($BT^2$) that exploits a series of learnable basis transformations (BT) to find the information in the new representation that is incompatible with the old representation. Because a BT is basically an orthonormal transformation, the output of a BT retains the entirety of the information stored in the input (see Lemma~\ref{lemma:change of basis}). With this in mind, we introduce some clever manipulation with BT that helps to exactly ``force'' incompatible information in the new representation into the additional dimensions, while keeping the compatible information in the BCT representation. Fig.~\ref{fig:dimension_reduction} provides a conceptual explanation of our $BT^2$ design.

In summary, our contributions are three-fold:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0mm, topsep=2mm]
    \item We show that the dilemma between backward compatibility and new model development can be reconciled with extra dimensions.
    
    \item We propose $BT^2$ that exploits a series of learnable changes of basis to effectively exploit the extra dimensions, and verify its empirical advantage over other state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of backward compatibility tasks.
    
    \item We extend $BT^2$ to more challenging and practical scenarios that have not been considered by existing works to the best of our knowledge. These include significant changes in model architecture, compatibility between different modalities, and even a series of updates in the model architecture mimicking the history of deep learning in the past decade. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Model Compatibility and Backward Compatibility.}
Model compatibility has received an increasing amount of attention in the research community due to its practical utility \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-01958, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2008-04821, 8953998, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2107.01057}, where the goal is to learn a shared representation space in which representations from different models can be directly compared. In particular, backward compatibility was introduced in \cite{9156906}, where the authors proposed an influence loss that tries to move the new and old representations closer. Subsequent works either introduce a transformation module \cite{Hu_2022, ramanujan2022forward, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2008-04821} or enhanced regularization loss functions \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-01958, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2201-09724, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.01583}. However, some key disadvantages associated with these approaches include that some of them depend on an auxilliary loss that prevents the new model from reaching its fullest potential, while others still require a lightweight backfilling. For the latter, a recent work known as Forward Compatible Training (FCT) \cite{ramanujan2022forward} has been proposed that trains a lightweight transformation module to transform the old representations into new representations for backward compatibility. However, \emph{a key difference between this paper with FCT is that FCT still requires lightweight backfilling and a side-information model (which hopefully contains sufficient information to train the transformation module) but those are not required in this paper}. %In this work, we aim to provide reliable backward compatibility without hurting the new model.

%\subsection{Representation Learning}
%\yifei{The task of Backward Compatible Representation Learning exploits techniques from the field of representation learning \cite{8395024, 6472238, kaya2019deep, bellet2015metric, hoffer2015deep, jaiswal2020survey}, where classification \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/LiuWYLRS17, DBLP:journals/corr/WangXCY17, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1811-12649, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-05599, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-09414}, metric learning \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2003-08505, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1904.06627, DBLP:journals/corr/WuMSK17, 8953619}, and contrastive learning \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2002-05709, He_2020_CVPR, NEURIPS2020_f3ada80d} are some major methods. For simplicity and better alignment with previous works in backward compatible representation learning \cite{8953998, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2108-01958, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.01583, ramanujan2022forward}, we adopt the classification loss for training the representation model.}

\paragraph{Continual Learning and Transfer Learning.}
The field of backward compatible representation learning is also related to continual learning \cite{Delange_2021, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1611.06194, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1812-00420, DBLP:journals/corr/RebuffiKL16, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1905-11614} and transfer learning \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-02685, DBLP:journals/corr/ZhangY17aa, 5288526, Zhao2010OTLAF, LU201514}. However, these two fields have different focuses. Continual learning focuses on training a model to perform well on a new task without forgetting the old task, and transfer learning focus on transferring a model to perform well on a different domain with the original training domain. On the other hand, backward compatible representation learning focuses on the same task, i.e., representation learning, such that the representation from the improved new model can be directly used to compare with the old model. 

Here is a summary of the key related works discussed in this section:

- Backward compatibility allows new representations to be directly compared with old representations, avoiding costly backfilling. Proposed in [9] using an influence loss. 

- Subsequent works improve on this using transformation modules [10-12] or enhanced regularization losses [13-15]. Still issues


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper, titled "BT2: Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation" is addressing the problem of backward compatibility in representation learning for image retrieval systems. The key issue is that when a new and improved representation model is developed, it generates representations that are incompatible with the previous model. This requires re-encoding all the images in the gallery (database of images for retrieval), a costly process known as "backfilling". 

The paper proposes a method called BT2 that allows training a new representation model that is backward compatible with the old model, avoiding the need for backfilling. The key ideas are:

1. There is an inherent tradeoff between backward compatibility and performance of the new model. Adding extra dimensions to the representation can help reconcile this dilemma.

2. Naively adding dimensions does not work well. The new dimensions should specifically capture extra information in the new model not compatible with the old model. 

3. They propose using a series of learnable basis transformations (BT) that retain information to effectively utilize the extra dimensions, forcing incompatible information into the new dimensions.

So in summary, the paper addresses the practical problem of avoiding costly backfilling when updating image retrieval systems to new representation models, by proposing BT2 to train backward compatible representations with clever usage of extra dimensions.

\ming{Excellent summary!} The summary effectively captures the key problem being addressed and the high-level ideas proposed in this paper. The explanation of the inherent tradeoff, need for new dimensions to capture incompatible information, and use of learnable basis transformations are clearly highlighted. Good job relating it back to the practical issue of avoiding expensive backfilling in real image retrieval systems.

\masa{Yes, wonderful summary! You capture the core ideas very concisely.}

Just to add: The summary could be improved by more clearly stating their three main contributions at the end. Based on the conclusion, it seems their contributions are:

1) Showing dimensions can reconcile backward compatibility and new model performance. 

2) Proposing BT2 to effectively exploit extra dimensions.

3) Extending BT2 to challenging cases like model architecture change, modality change, and series of updates.

Stating the contributions explicitly would further strengthen an already great summary. Nice work!

\ming{Excellent suggestion by Masa to explicitly list out the 3 main contributions at the end to further improve the summary. Doing so provides a concise high-level view of what are new in this work.}

Read the following paper: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach? Please provide constructive feedback on how the paper could be improved.

Here are some strengths and weaknesses of the proposed BT2 approach in the paper "BT2: Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation":

Strengths:

- The paper addresses an important practical problem of avoiding costly backfilling in image retrieval systems. Solving backward compatibility helps with model updating in real systems.

- The idea of using extra dimensions to reconcile backward compatibility and new model performance is intuitive and makes sense.

- BT2 provides an effective way to exploit the extra dimensions through principled use of basis transformations.

- The method is shown to work well empirically on diverse and challenging settings like model architecture change.

- The approach does not require any backfilling or transformation of old representations.

Weaknesses:

- While extra dimensions help, the representation size will keep increasing with multiple updates over time. At some point backfilling may be needed.

- It is not clearly explained why naive dimension increase does not work well. More analysis or intuition could be provided.

- The series of model updates experiment only tries architectures in the 2010s. Testing on more diverse modern architectures could be more convincing.

- Additional datasets besides CIFAR and ImageNet could be used to demonstrate generalization.

- Uncertainty estimates like confidence intervals would help establish statistical strength of improvements.

- The writing could be improved in some places for clarity and precision.

To address these, the paper could include more analysis/intuition, experiment with more architectures, evaluate on more datasets, add uncertainty measures, and refine writing. Overall though, BT2 seems like a promising approach to a practical problem with solid empirical results.

Read the following paper: What is the key problem being addressed? What approach does this work take to solve it? What are your thoughts on the proposed solution?

This paper titled "BT2: Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation" addresses the key problem of avoiding costly backfilling when updating image retrieval systems to new representation models. 

The issue is that new representation models produce embeddings incompatible with previous models, requiring re-encoding the entire gallery of images. This backfilling process can be prohibitive for large galleries.

The approach taken is training backward compatible representations for the new model that can be directly compared with old model embeddings, avoiding backfilling. 

Specifically, the paper proposes BT2 which adds extra dimensions to capture incompatible information. It uses learnable basis transformations that retain information to force incompatible content into the new dimensions. 

This allows training a single new model that is backward compatible without hurting performance. BT2 demonstrates strong results on backward compatibility tasks like architecture changes.

My thoughts:

- Addressing backfilling for model updating is practically valuable for real systems. The overall idea makes sense.

- Using dimensions specifically for incompatible information and basis transforms to retain all information is clever.

- Results seem solid, but further experiments on modern architectures and uncertainty estimates would be good.

- Long-term, the representation size may keep increasing with multiple updates over time.

- While promising, how it compares with existing lightweight transformation methods like FCT is unclear.

Overall, I think BT2 proposes a sensible approach to an important problem, with solid results as a proof of concept. Practical usefulness would depend on comparisons to existing methods and continued evaluation over multiple updates. But it offers a novel way to address model updating in retrieval systems.

\masa{Excellent summary! You clearly explained the key problem, proposed approach, and provided thoughtful feedback. You highlighted well that it addresses a useful issue, offers a novel solution with solid initial results, but needs more comparison to existing methods and testing over time. Great critique!}
