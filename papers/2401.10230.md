# [TEXterity: Tactile Extrinsic deXterity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In-hand manipulation (repositioning an object within a grasp) is difficult due to challenges in state estimation, planning, and control. It requires reasoning about the hybrid dynamics of contact between the hand, object, and environment.
- Precise in-hand manipulation control has received little attention, but is crucial for complex tasks like assembly and tool use.

Proposed Solution: 
- A simultaneous tactile estimation and control framework that integrates robot proprioception and tactile sensing to both estimate object pose and generate plans to actively manipulate the pose.  
- Consists of two components:
   1. Discrete pose estimator: Uses Viterbi decoding to track the global object pose on a coarse discrete grid over time, reducing tactile ambiguity. 
   2. Continuous pose estimator-controller: Refines the pose estimate with higher precision on a continuous state space, while simultaneously planning motions to achieve desired goal configurations for the object.

Key Contributions:
- Addresses precise in-hand manipulation control, a relatively less explored area, by proposing a method that simultaneously estimates object pose and controls it in a closed loop fashion using tactile sensing.
- Combines strengths of prior Tac2Pose tactile estimation work and simultaneous contact state estimation and control work into an integrated system.
- Evaluated on real-world in-hand sliding manipulation tasks with diverse objects, achieving precise control to meet desired goal configurations.
- Demonstrated applicability on an insertion task, enhancing grasps to facilitate the insertion.
- Framework is compatible with arbitrary but known object geometries, does not require accurate contact models, and works directly from raw tactile images.

In summary, the key innovation is the simultaneous estimation and closed-loop control for in-hand manipulation using tactile sensing, with evaluations showing precise manipulation control performance. This has potential for facilitating complex dexterous tasks requiring precision.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a simultaneous tactile estimator and controller that leverages extrinsic dexterity to recursively estimate and manipulate the pose of grasped objects by pushing them against the environment, enabling precise in-hand regrasping for tasks like insertion where visual perception is limited.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a novel approach that combines tactile estimation and control for in-hand object manipulation. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a simultaneous tactile estimator-controller framework that integrates measurements from robot kinematics and an image-based tactile sensor to simultaneously estimate object pose and generate motion plans to control the pose of a grasped object. 

- This allows precise control of in-hand sliding regrasps by pushing the object against an external surface (extrinsic dexterity) using only tactile sensing and proprioception, without needing accurate analytical models or learning policies from scratch.

- The proposed method combines and enhances previous approaches for tactile pose estimation (Tac2Pose) and extrinsic contact control, providing a more holistic solution for planar in-hand manipulation. 

- Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to achieve diverse manipulation objectives and outperform ablation models in estimation accuracy, with potential for enabling closed-loop dexterous tasks requiring precision.

In summary, the main contribution is the simultaneous tactile estimation and control framework for precise in-hand manipulation relying on tactile sensing and proprioception.
