# [TaylorShift: Shifting the Complexity of Self-Attention from Squared to   Linear (and Back) using Taylor-Softmax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02920)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformers becomes a major bottleneck when processing long input sequences, limiting their applicability. 
- Current approaches to enable linear scaling sacrifice token-to-token interactions or convey only averaged, global information. This leads to compromised performance.

Proposed Solution - TaylorShift:
- Reformulates the Taylor approximation of the softmax function in the attention mechanism to enable computing full token-to-token interactions in linear time and space complexity.
- Introduces a tensor-product based operator to unroll the squared term when approximating the exponential function.
- Proposes a normalization scheme to counteract unstable growth of intermediate results during computation.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretically analyzes the efficiency crossover points where TaylorShift starts to outperform standard attention, in terms of both computational complexity and memory requirements.
- Empirically validates the crossover points and demonstrates linear scaling behavior.
- Shows competitive performance across diverse tasks and modalities compared to standard Transformers and other linear attention mechanisms.
- Performs ablation studies on key components like the normalization scheme, demonstrating their necessity. 
- Provides insights into leveraging multiple attention heads to further improve efficiency.

In summary, the paper introduces TaylorShift, a reformulation of the Taylor softmax enabling efficient calculation of full token-token interactions in Transformers. Theoretical analysis paired with empirical validation demonstrates linear scaling and competitive performance across tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 TaylorShift introduces a reformulation of the Taylor softmax that enables computing full token-to-token interactions in Transformer self-attention with linear time and space complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of TaylorShift, a novel reformulation of the Taylor softmax that enables computing full token-to-token interactions in the attention mechanism in linear time and space complexity. Specifically, the paper:

- Introduces an efficient implementation of Taylor-softmax attention that leverages a tensor-product-based operator to linearize the quadratic complexity term. This allows preserving full token-to-token interactions while reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

- Provides a theoretical analysis to identify the exact transition points where the proposed efficient Taylor-softmax attention becomes more efficient than standard attention in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements.

- Empirically validates the analysis on efficiency transition points and shows that TaylorShift attention enhances memory efficiency for sequences as short as 800 tokens and accelerates inference for inputs longer than around 1700 tokens.

- Evaluates TaylorShift Transformer models on several long-sequence tasks and shows it matches or exceeds the performance of standard Transformers while having more favorable scaling.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient reformulation of attention that retains the full expressiveness of standard attention while reducing the quadratic complexity to linear, enabled by a novel application of Taylor series and tensor products.
