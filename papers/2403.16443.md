# [CodeS: Natural Language to Code Repository via Multi-Layer Sketch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper proposes a new software engineering task called "Natural Language to Code Repository" (NL2Repo). This task aims to automatically generate an entire code repository from natural language requirements. NL2Repo poses new challenges compared to existing NL2Code tasks due to long, complex requirements and the need to produce highly structured code repositories.

Proposed Solution - CodeS Framework:
The paper introduces CodeS, a framework that breaks down the complex NL2Repo task using a multi-layer sketch approach. CodeS has three modules:

1) RepoSketcher: Generates a repository directory structure from requirements 
2) FileSketcher: Creates file sketches (imports + function signatures) for each file
3) SketchFiller: Fills in the function bodies for each file sketch  

By decomposing repository generation into layers, CodeS allows progressive refinement from high-level structure down to implementation details.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes the novel NL2Repo task for full code repository generation

2) Introduces CodeS, a sketch-based framework to address NL2Repo by dividing it into sub-tasks

3) Develops SketchEval, a benchmark to assess NL2Repo solutions, with a new metric SketchBLEU 

4) Conducts extensive experiments on SketchEval and user studies to demonstrate CodeS's effectiveness. For example, CodeS improves over baselines by 13.15% in SketchBLEU.

5) Open-sources CodeS framework to facilitate research into automatic code repository generation.

In summary, the paper formalizes the NL2Repo problem and provides an initial solution with the sketch-based CodeS framework. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate CodeS's potential in assisting with complex, real-world software projects.
