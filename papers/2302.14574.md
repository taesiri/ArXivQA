# [A Little Bit Attention Is All You Need for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14574)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can attention blocks be integrated into a ResNet-50 architecture for person re-identification in a way that improves accuracy while minimally impacting inference speed, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications?The key points related to this question are:- Attention blocks like non-local attention can significantly improve re-ID accuracy but slow down inference speed too much for robotics applications. - The paper investigates how many attention blocks are really needed and where they should be placed in a ResNet-50 to get a good accuracy vs speed tradeoff.- They propose a new attention block called C-NL that combines properties of channel-wise and non-local attention for better accuracy with minimal speed impact.- Through neural architecture search, they derive rules for integrating a small number of C-NL blocks into ResNet-50 to surpass ResNet-101 accuracy while only slowing down inference by 5%.- They validate the performance gain on a robotic dataset, showing the value of this approach for robot re-ID applications needing real-time inference.In summary, the main research question is how to effectively incorporate attention for robot re-ID using a minimal number of blocks placed strategically within ResNet-50 to maximize accuracy gains without too much speed tradeoff.
