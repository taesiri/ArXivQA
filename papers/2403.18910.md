# [A Geometric Explanation of the Likelihood OOD Detection Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18910)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep generative models (DGMs) such as normalizing flows and diffusion models are commonly used for density estimation and can assign likelihood scores to data points. Surprisingly, when trained on complex datasets like CIFAR10, they tend to assign higher likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from simpler datasets like SVHN, even though they never generate SVHN-like samples. This phenomenon is puzzling since these models are trained to assign high likelihoods only to in-distribution data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides a geometric explanation for this paradox. The key insight is that even though OOD data may have high densities, they lie on low-dimensional manifolds that have negligible probability mass. Specifically:

1) Natural data is concentrated on low-dimensional manifolds. OOD data from simpler distributions lies on manifolds of even lower dimension. 

2) The density learned by DGMs assigns high values to these OOD manifolds. However, their intrinsic dimension is small, hence the probability mass assigned to regions around them is negligible.

3) Local intrinsic dimension (LID) indicates if a region has high or low probability mass. By thresholding both likelihood and LID, OOD points can be detected even if their likelihoods are high.

Main Contributions:

1) Provides a geometric understanding of the OOD detection paradox in terms of probability mass and LID.

2) Derives mathematical connections between LID and probability mass assigned by a density model.

3) Proposes a practical OOD detection method using likelihood and LID thresholds that matches or beats SOTA methods using the same model architectures.

4) Empirically verifies the explanation on real datasets using normalizing flows and diffusion models. Demonstrates boosts in AUC-ROC over using just likelihoods.

In summary, the paper offers a novel perspective on likelihood-based OOD detection grounded in differential geometry, and leverages this understanding to develop an effective technique. The strong results support the validity of the proposed explanation.
