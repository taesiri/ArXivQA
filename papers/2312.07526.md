# [RTMO: Towards High-Performance One-Stage Real-Time Multi-Person Pose   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07526)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces RTMO, a real-time one-stage multi-person pose estimation framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. RTMO seamlessly integrates coordinate classification into the YOLO architecture by representing keypoints using dual 1D heatmaps. To address the incompatibilities of coordinate classification in dense prediction scenarios, the authors propose a Dynamic Coordinate Classifier (DCC) which features dynamic bin allocation localized to bounding boxes and learnable bin representations. They also introduce a novel loss function based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation that allows for per-sample uncertainty learning, automatically balancing task difficulty. Experiments demonstrate RTMO's superiority over other real-time pose estimators, attaining 74.8% AP on COCO val while operating at 141 FPS on a V100 GPU. The model also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging CrowdPose benchmark among one-stage methods. By combining the precision of coordinate classification with the efficiency of a YOLO-based architecture, RTMO delivers both high accuracy and real-time performance for multi-person pose estimation.
