# [VideoMamba: State Space Model for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Video understanding poses two key challenges - modeling the large spatiotemporal redundancy within short clips and capturing complex long-range dependencies across longer contexts. Prior works using 3D CNNs or attention-based transformers fail to address both simultaneously.  

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes VideoMamba, a purely state space model (SSM) based architecture for efficient video understanding. It builds upon Mamba, a linear complexity model for long sequence modeling in NLP. VideoMamba introduces bidirectional Mamba blocks tailored for spatiotemporal modeling of videos in a ViT style framework. This allows it to overcome limitations of 3D CNNs and transformers, enabling efficient long-term dynamic video understanding.

Key Contributions:

1) Demonstrates VideoMamba's scalability for visual tasks without large-scale pretraining, via a self-distillation technique to prevent overfitting.

2) Shows superior sensitivity over transformers for recognizing fine-grained short-term actions while being suitable for masked modeling.

3) Significant gains over feature-based models for long video understanding tasks, showcasing superiority from end-to-end training. Processes 64-frame videos 6x faster than TimeSformer with 40x lower GPU memory.

4) Robustness for multi-modal tasks like video-text retrieval, highlighting compatibility with other modalities.  

Overall, VideoMamba sets a new state-of-the-art across diverse video understanding tasks spanning both short and long videos. Its efficiency, scalability and effectiveness make it well suited to become a cornerstone technique for comprehensive video comprehension.
