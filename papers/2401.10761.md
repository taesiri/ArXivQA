## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Compressing images and videos for machine analysis is becoming increasingly important with the rise of AI, but traditional codecs are optimized for human viewing, not machine analysis tasks. 
- End-to-end learned image codecs can outperform traditional codecs for machine vision but learned video codecs still lag behind.
- Conventional video codecs like VVC are interoperable and hardware friendly but not optimized for machine analysis.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a hybrid codec called NN-VVC that combines a learned image codec (LIC) for intra-frame coding with a conventional video codec (CVC like VVC) for inter-frame coding.

- LIC is a convolutional autoencoder that is trained in a self-supervised way to preserve features useful for machine vision while compressing images.

- Intra Human Adapter (IHA) post-processes LIC reconstructed frames to reduce artifacts and make them better references for CVC inter-frame coding.

- Inter Machine Adapter (IMA) post-processes CVC inter-frames to enhance machine performance.

- Fallback mode uses CVC for all frames at very low bitrates when LIC artifacts are too severe.

Main Contributions:

- First hybrid video codec combining learned image codec and conventional video codec.

- Significantly outperforms VVC anchor for machine analysis tasks over multiple image and video test sets.

- Achieves BD-rate reductions up to -53% for image coding and -57% for video coding versus VVC anchor.

- Also shows machine analysis task metric gains (BD-mAP/BD-MOTA) up to 4.84 and 2.67 respectively versus anchor.

- Carefully designed components (LIC, IHA, IMA) work together to improve overall system.

- Demonstrates feasibility and benefits of hybrid learned + conventional codec approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hybrid video codec called NN-VVC that combines a learned image codec optimized for machine vision tasks with the Versatile Video Coding standard to achieve improved coding efficiency and machine task performance compared to using the VVC standard alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid video codec called NN-VVC that combines a learned image codec (LIC) for intra-frame coding and the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard for inter-frame coding. Specifically:

- They use a convolutional neural network based learned image codec to encode and decode intra-frames. This brings the benefits of learned image codecs like improved rate-distortion performance.

- They use the mature and standardized VVC codec to encode and decode inter-frames, benefiting from its efficiency and hardware support. 

- They introduce an Intra Human Adapter (IHA) to filter the reconstructed intra-frames before using them as references for VVC inter-frame coding. This reduces artifacts and improves compression efficiency.

- They apply an Inter Machine Adapter (IMA) to enhance the VVC decoded inter-frames for improved machine task performance.

- Experiments show significant bitrate savings (BD-rate reductions of 26.8-43.2%) and machine task performance gains compared to using VVC alone, demonstrating the benefits of combining learned and conventional codecs.

In summary, the main contribution is the NN-VVC hybrid codec that brings complementary strengths of learned image codecs and standard video codecs to achieve state-of-the-art coding efficiency for machine vision applications.
