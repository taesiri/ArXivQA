# [Adversaral Doodles: Interpretable and Human-drawable Attacks Provide   Describable Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15994)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel type of adversarial attack called "adversarial doodles" - optimized sets of Bézier curves that can be overlaid on images to cause misclassification when interpreted by AI models. The key innovation is making these attacks human-interpretable and human-replicable. The authors use a differentiable rasterizer module to optimize compact Bézier curves that fool models like CLIP even when hand-drawn by people. They enhance robustness to human variation by using random image transformations during optimization. The resulting "doodles" provide intuitive and describable insights into model failures - e.g. adding butterfly-like strokes to birds gets misclassified as butterflies. The interpretable nature and ability for physical replication opens up new possibilities for understanding and testing AI classifiers. Overall, this work introduces an interpretable style of attack with the potential for new research directions in adversarial robustness and model insights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a method to generate attacks with a set of Bézier curves through gradient-based optimization using a differentiable rasterizer.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces "adversarial doodles" as a novel type of attack. What are the key properties of adversarial doodles that make them unique compared to previous adversarial attack methods? 

2. The paper optimizes Bézier curves to generate the adversarial doodles. Explain the rationale behind using Bézier curves rather than directly optimizing the pixel values. What are the advantages?

3. The paper incorporates random perspective transformations during optimization to improve robustness. Explain how this helps make the attacks more robust to variations when humans attempt to replicate them.

4. What is the motivation behind regularizing the attacked/doodled area? How does adding this regularization term impact the visual quality and success rates of attacks?

5. The interpretability of attacks is a key focus in this work. In your own words, what insights do the resulting "adversarial doodles" provide into the inner workings of the CLIP model?

6. The paper discovers both "sketch-like" and "typographic" adversarial doodles. Compare and contrast these two types of doodles. What unique insights does each provide? 

7. Some of the sketch-like doodles provide spatial and positional insights, rather than just shape-based ones. Elaborate on these spatial/positional insights discovered.

8. For practical usage, discuss the limitations of the current method in generating less perceptible attacks. What changes would you suggest to make the attacks stealthier?

9. The paper focuses primarily on digital attacks. How might you extend this approach to create physically-realizable attacks in the real world? What challenges might arise?

10. The paper performs ablation studies on key components like random transformations and regularization. What other aspects would you suggest ablating to better analyze the method? What might we learn?
