# [GPT vs Human for Scientific Reviews: A Dual Source Review on   Applications of ChatGPT in Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03769)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Presenting a comparative review from two perspectives (Scispace and a human reviewer) on recent papers focused on applications of ChatGPT in scientific fields like medicine, machine learning, engineering, and geography. 

- Providing a sample of frameworks developed to enhance different versions of ChatGPT for domain-specific tasks across these disciplines.

- Analyzing and discussing the performance of Scispace versus a human reviewer in comprehending and summarizing literature related to ChatGPT advancements, as evaluated from the perspectives of informed and uninformed assessors.

- Exploring limitations of Scispace/LLM-based models in literature review and articulating the need for human oversight and involvement in research.

- Initiating critical discussion on integrating AI like Scispace in academic literature reviews and research.

In summary, the key contribution is a dual-perspective comparative analysis of an LLM (Scispace) and a human reviewer in understanding literature on ChatGPT in science, including both qualitative discussion and quantitative assessments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using both SciSpace, an LLM-based system, and a human reviewer to analyze papers on applications of ChatGPT in science. What are the key benefits and limitations of having dual perspectives for literature reviews?

2. The study categorizes questions into objective and subjective types. What additional analysis could be done by further dividing questions based on the level of inference required? How might performance differ across lower and higher-order questions?  

3. Statistical analysis reveals alignment between SciSpace and human responses for 50% of objective questions. What are possible reasons for lack of alignment in the remaining 50%? How can alignment be improved?

4. GPT-4 often rates human responses higher in accuracy but SciSpace higher in structure, clarity and completeness. What tradeoffs exist between depth/precision versus breadth/verbosity? How can an optimal balance be achieved?

5. Crowd preferences leaned towards human responses for subjective questions. However, informed GPT-4 rated both equally. What explains this discrepancy? How reliable are evaluations from systems like GPT-4?

6. Several examples highlight SciSpace's struggle with structure, verbosity, graphics interpretation etc. What specific enhancements could improve performance on these fronts? 

7. The perturbation test reveals SciSpace's sensitivity to question wording. How can robustness be improved for complex, multifaceted queries? What other perturbation tests could provide further insight?

8. GPT-4 is noted to have limitations regarding depth of analysis and subjectivity. How do its annotations compare to those of human experts from the specific domains studied?

9. The scope covers 4 scientific domains but differences between fields are not analyzed. What variations might exist across disciplines? How could evaluations be tailored?

10. Beyond accuracy, what other metrics could be used to evaluate literature review systems like SciSpace? How can strengths like speed and scale be objectively measured?


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it appear to be:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- ChatGPT
- Scientific reviews
- Dual source review
- Applications of ChatGPT in science 
- Comparative analysis
- Literature review
- Performance evaluation
- SciSpace
- Informed and uninformed evaluators
- Accuracy
- Structure and clarity
- Completeness

The paper seems to focus on analyzing the performance of the LLM-based system SciSpace compared to a human expert in reviewing recent literature related to applications of ChatGPT across scientific domains. It adopts a dual source approach with responses from both SciSpace and a human reviewer, which are then evaluated by informed (GPT-4) and uninformed (GPT-3.5, crowd panel) evaluators. Some key aspects examined include accuracy, structure/clarity, and completeness of the SciSpace versus human responses. The goal appears to be gaining insights into the capabilities of LLMs in assisting with literature reviews to inform the integration of AI in academic research.
