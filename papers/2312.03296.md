# [Cooperative Probabilistic Trajectory Forecasting under Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03296)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for cooperative trajectory prediction of occluded pedestrians using relative pose estimation between two connected stationary depth cameras. The method first establishes the relative orientation between the cameras using feature matching techniques. This recovered pose is then used to transform the occluded pedestrian's trajectory from one camera's frame of reference to the other. An encoder-decoder LSTM model is trained to predict pedestrian trajectories in a probabilistic manner to account for uncertainties. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted distribution of the transformed pedestrian trajectory closely matches the actual trajectory if there was no occlusion. Further testing under various occlusion scenarios like intermittent and partial occlusion shows the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative perception framework to reliably estimate and predict occluded pedestrian trajectories. The method promises advancements in multi-agent navigation by addressing challenges like occlusion through sharing pose information without requiring transmission of extensive sensor data. Limitations are the use of static cameras, which can be tackled in future work through visual odometry. Overall, the paper introduces a novel real-time cooperative trajectory forecasting approach to handle occlusion using relative pose estimation and probabilistic prediction.
