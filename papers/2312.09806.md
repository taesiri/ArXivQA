# [Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Retrieval-enhanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Retrieval-enhanced Learning":

Problem:
- Biomedical entity linking (BioEL) aims to map textual mentions (e.g. diseases, chemicals) to standard entities in a biomedical ontology. It is an essential task for biomedical applications.
- Existing BioEL methods struggle with rare and difficult entities due to the long-tailed distribution of entities, limiting their generalization capability. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a retrieval-enhanced learning paradigm called kNN-BioEL to improve BioEL's generalization for long-tailed entities.
- kNN-BioEL utilizes a bi-encoder to independently embed mentions and entities. During training, it employs contrastive learning with dynamic hard negative sampling to learn fine-grained entity representations. 
- During inference, kNN-BioEL constructs a datastore of training instances' embeddings and labels. Given a new mention, it retrieves the k-nearest neighbors from the datastore and interpolates the model's prediction with the kNN distribution to produce the final prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a simple yet effective kNN-based retrieval mechanism to leverage existing instances as clues for improving BioEL model's generalization, without needing extra knowledge.
- Designs a contrastive learning objective with dynamic hard negative sampling to better capture fine-grained semantic differences between biomedical entities.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple BioEL benchmarks. Model analysis demonstrates kNN-BioEL's capability in handling long-tailed entities.

In summary, the paper presents a novel kNN-enhanced approach to improve biomedical entity linking by retrieving and leveraging valuable knowledge from training instances.
