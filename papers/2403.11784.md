# [ForzaETH Race Stack -- Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully   Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents a complete autonomous racing software stack called the "ForzaETH Race Stack" for 1:10 scale autonomous racing cars that compete in the F1TENTH racing competition. 

Problem:
- Autonomous racing pushes software and hardware to the limit but requires complex custom solutions, limiting reproducibility. 
- Researchers without comprehensive expertise across mechanical, electrical and robotics domains need to spend significant time on system integration.
- The F1TENTH competition facilitates head-to-head racing but focuses mainly on 1v1 scenarios, not true multi-agent racing.

Proposed Solution:
- The ForzaETH Race Stack software architecture for the F1TENTH 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform.
- Uses only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware for accessibility and reproducibility.
- Facilitates both time trials and unrestricted head-to-head racing.
- Architected using the "See-Think-Act" paradigm with State Estimation, Opponent Estimation, Planning and Control modules.
- Aim: Provide open source race-winning solution to lower barriers to innovation in autonomous racing research.

Main Contributions:  
- Details the complete software architecture and hardware components.
- Quantitatively evaluates the performance of all key autonomy modules like state estimation, perception, planning and control. 
- Demonstrates autonomous overtaking maneuvers in head-to-head racing scenarios.
- Open sources the full race stack that won international F1TENTH competitions to promote accessibility.
- Lowers barriers to innovation for autonomous racing technologies by providing a complete platform.

In summary, it is the first detailed open source autonomous racing solution on COTS hardware that demonstrably achieves competitive racing performance aimed at advancing research and education in the field.
