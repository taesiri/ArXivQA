# [Enhancing the Rate-Distortion-Perception Flexibility of Learned Image   Codecs with Conditional Diffusion Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learned image compression models optimized for rate-distortion (RD) often produce unsatisfactory perceptual quality at low bitrates. Generative compression methods using GANs or diffusion models can improve perceptual quality but have limitations - GANs can only produce one rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff point, while diffusion models tend to have mode collapse and blurring.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a learned image codec with a standard RD-optimized encoder/prior from an existing model (MSH) and a conditional diffusion decoder. The shared latent space allows flexibility to decode with either the standard decoder (for low distortion) or the diffusion decoder (for improved perception). The sampling strategy of the diffusion model can be tuned to modulate computational complexity and achieve different RDP tradeoffs at the same bitrate.

Main Contributions:
1) Encoder is reused from existing learned codecs so no end-to-end retraining needed, retains compatibility with standard decoders
2) Flexibility to choose between distortion or perceptual quality decoder 
3) Diffusion model can create new RDP tradeoffs by changing sampling method
4) Reconstructions have both high fidelity and perceptual quality
5) Shows perceptual quality can improve even with RD-optimized latents by using a suitable decoder

The proposed model achieves promising results between two recent specialized distortion-focused and perception-focused diffusion codec models, indicating the flexibility of diffusion decoders. Future work is suggested to explore sampling methods for more RDP flexibility and add guidance to the diffusion model to further improve perceptual performance.
