# [Dual-Personalizing Adapter for Federated Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing personalized federated learning (PFL) methods focus on optimizing performance on targeted local tasks but often neglect challenges posed by test-time distribution shifts when clients may encounter other tasks. This limits practical applicability as real-world scenarios demand capability across diverse tasks.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new setting called "test-time personalization" which requires models to not only perform well on targeted local tasks (personalization) but also tackle unseen test-time tasks with distribution shifts. To address this, they propose a "dual-personalizing adapter" (FedDPA) framework with two key components - a global adapter to acquire general knowledge for test-time tasks, and a local adapter to learn personalized knowledge for targeted tasks. An instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism is also introduced to balance contributions of global and local adapters during inference.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel concept of "test-time personalization" in federated learning to account for distribution shifts in practical deployment
- Presents the FedDPA method with global and local adapters to realize test-time personalization by learning both general and personalized knowledge
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on constructed federated NLP datasets, demonstrating efficacy in test-time personalization over existing approaches
- Provides exhaustive analysis on heterogeneous benchmarks across diverse NLP tasks to validate the proposed ideas

In summary, this paper identifies an important gap in existing PFL research regarding test-time distribution shifts, and contributes a new setting, method and extensive evaluations to address this limitation and enable more comprehensive personalized federated learning.
