# Automatic Chain of Thought Prompting in Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How does the number of clusters used for question clustering affect the error rate of question answering when using zero-shot CoT prompting?The paper investigates clustering the questions into different numbers of clusters (2, 4, 6, and 8 clusters) and analyzing the error rate of zero-shot CoT prompting on the questions in each cluster. The hypothesis appears to be that the errors made by zero-shot CoT prompting will tend to cluster in certain groups of similar questions, so the number of clusters can illuminate this phenomenon. By showing the error rate per cluster for different numbers of clusters, the paper examines how the granularity of the clustering affects the observed clustering of errors.In summary, the central research question is about how varying the number of question clusters affects the observed grouping of errors made by zero-shot CoT prompting on a question answering task. The hypothesis is that errors will cluster in groups of similar questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of an automatic chain-of-thought (Auto-CoT) prompting method to eliminate the need for manual design of demonstrations in few-shot prompting of large language models. The key ideas are:1) Using question clustering and diversity-based sampling to construct prompting demonstrations automatically, rather than relying on manual design. This helps mitigate the issue of models replicating reasoning mistakes from demonstrations.2) Leveraging the "Let's think step by step" prompt to generate reasoning chains as demonstrations from the sampled questions, taking advantage of LLMs' capabilities as decent zero-shot reasoners. 3) Applying simple heuristics to select higher quality demonstrations during sampling.The proposed Auto-CoT method is evaluated on 10 reasoning tasks and shown to match or exceed the performance of manual CoT prompting that requires hand-designed demonstrations. Overall, the main contribution is providing a way to automate the demonstration design process for few-shot prompting of LLMs, while maintaining competitive reasoning performance compared to manual demonstration design.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately without the full text of the paper, it is difficult for me to summarize it in a sentence. However, based on the figure, it seems the paper is analyzing the error rates of some clustering method with different numbers of clusters. The error rate varies across the different numbers of clusters, with 2 clusters having the lowest error rate overall. If I had to guess, the one sentence summary would be something like "This paper analyzes how the error rate of a clustering method varies with the number of clusters, finding that 2 clusters gives the lowest error." But this is just speculation without seeing the full context. Please provide the full paper text if you want a more accurate TL;DR summary.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the snippet provided, here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper seems to present experimental results comparing different methods for chain-of-thought prompting in large language models. This is aligned with recent work exploring how to elicit reasoning and explanations from large language models.- The two main approaches compared - Zero-Shot-CoT and Manual-CoT - seem to reflect common techniques in this area. Zero-shot prompting relies purely on the capabilities of the pretrained model, while manual prompting provides examples and demonstrations. Comparing these methods is a useful contribution.- Evaluating performance on a range of reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic) provides a fairly comprehensive assessment. Testing on multiple benchmark datasets is also a plus.- The proposed Auto-CoT approach aims to automate the manual demonstration creation in Manual-CoT. Finding ways to automate or improve manual prompting is an active area of research.- The analysis investigating the impact of demonstration quality and diversity could provide useful insights. Understanding what makes an effective prompt is still an open challenge.Overall, this appears to be solidly positioned in relation to related work on reasoning and explanations for LLMs. The head-to-head comparison of methods and proposal of an automated prompting approach seem to be good contributions. More details would be needed to fully assess the novelty and importance of the ideas. But in general it seems aligned with the current direction of research in this field.
