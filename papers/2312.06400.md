# [DiT-Head: High-Resolution Talking Head Synthesis using Diffusion   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06400)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called DiT-Head for high-quality, person-agnostic talking head video synthesis using diffusion transformers (DiTs). DiT-Head takes an audio signal as input to drive the generation process and produces lip-synced talking head videos while preserving the identity and expressions of the speaker. The model uses two autoencoders to encode ground truth and masked face images into latent representations. These latents are then fed as conditional inputs into a DiT which models the posterior distribution and performs iterative denoising over diffusion steps. Cross-attention between the face latents and encoded audio features allows the DiT to map audio cues to facial movements. Additional input conditions like reference frames and temporal audio context enforce coherence across frames. Compared to prior works, DiT-Head achieves higher visual quality, identity/expression preservation, and generalization ability. Quantitatively it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on measures like PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS and FID while qualitatively generating smooth, high-resolution outputs. Limitations remain in terms of computational efficiency and multi-lingual capability. Overall, the model shows promising capability for realistic talking head generation across various applications.
