# [Neural Mesh Fusion: Unsupervised 3D Planar Surface Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Reconstructing and parsing 3D planar surfaces from indoor scenes using multi-view images is useful for applications like AR/VR. 
- Existing methods rely on ground truth 3D geometry or planar annotations, which are costly to obtain. 
- Implicit neural representations like NeRF are challenging to parse into planar surfaces. Explicit representations have not been well explored.

Proposed Solution - Neural Mesh Fusion (NMF):
- Represents scene geometry using an explicit triangular mesh, formed by fusing planar mesh fragments from keyframes.
- Optimizes vertex positions using a neural renderer with modular MLP that outputs color, transparency and plane instance embeddings. 
- Unsupervised 3D planar segmentation by applying contrastive learning on the plane instance embeddings.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces NMF - an efficient framework using explicit mesh representation and neural rendering for joint optimization of multi-view reconstruction and unsupervised planar parsing.
- Achieves state-of-the-art planar segmentation performance on ScanNet without using any 3D or planar ground truth supervision. 
- More efficient than implicit representations. Generalizes well to unseen test scenes unlike supervised methods.
- Among the first mesh reconstruction works to use explicit triangular meshes with neural rendering for scene-level modeling.

In summary, the paper proposes Neural Mesh Fusion, a novel unsupervised learning approach for jointly optimizing 3D planar geometry reconstruction and segmentation from multi-view images. It eliminates the need for costly ground truth annotations by integrating neural rendering techniques with explicit surface mesh representations. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and efficiency over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Neural Mesh Fusion, an unsupervised method for jointly optimizing a polygon mesh representation from multi-view images and parsing the mesh into distinct 3D planar surface instances, without requiring ground truth 3D geometry or plane annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It introduces Neural Mesh Fusion (NMF), a novel framework for unsupervised 3D planar surface understanding. NMF is among the first mesh reconstruction methods to employ explicit neural rendering with triangular surface meshes.

2. NMF achieves 3D plane instance segmentation by combining contrastive learning and neural rendering. As such, only posed RGB images are needed, eliminating the need for 3D or planar ground truth.

3. NMF shows superior 3D planar reconstruction performance, as compared to models trained with 3D ground truth on ScanNet data. It seamlessly handles new test scenes, while pre-trained models suffer significant performance degradation due to domain disparities.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an unsupervised learning framework, Neural Mesh Fusion, for jointly optimizing a 3D mesh reconstruction and segmenting it into planar regions using only posed RGB images, without requiring any 3D or planar labels. This allows the method to generalize well to new scenes.
