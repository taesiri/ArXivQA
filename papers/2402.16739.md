# [Neural Mesh Fusion: Unsupervised 3D Planar Surface Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Reconstructing and parsing 3D planar surfaces from indoor scenes using multi-view images is useful for applications like AR/VR. 
- Existing methods rely on ground truth 3D geometry or planar annotations, which are costly to obtain. 
- Implicit neural representations like NeRF are challenging to parse into planar surfaces. Explicit representations have not been well explored.

Proposed Solution - Neural Mesh Fusion (NMF):
- Represents scene geometry using an explicit triangular mesh, formed by fusing planar mesh fragments from keyframes.
- Optimizes vertex positions using a neural renderer with modular MLP that outputs color, transparency and plane instance embeddings. 
- Unsupervised 3D planar segmentation by applying contrastive learning on the plane instance embeddings.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces NMF - an efficient framework using explicit mesh representation and neural rendering for joint optimization of multi-view reconstruction and unsupervised planar parsing.
- Achieves state-of-the-art planar segmentation performance on ScanNet without using any 3D or planar ground truth supervision. 
- More efficient than implicit representations. Generalizes well to unseen test scenes unlike supervised methods.
- Among the first mesh reconstruction works to use explicit triangular meshes with neural rendering for scene-level modeling.

In summary, the paper proposes Neural Mesh Fusion, a novel unsupervised learning approach for jointly optimizing 3D planar geometry reconstruction and segmentation from multi-view images. It eliminates the need for costly ground truth annotations by integrating neural rendering techniques with explicit surface mesh representations. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and efficiency over existing methods.
