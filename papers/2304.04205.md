# [Shape-Erased Feature Learning for Visible-Infrared Person   Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04205)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that erasing body-shape-related semantic concepts in the learned features can force the VI-ReID model to extract more diverse and discriminative modality-shared features for identification. The key points are:- Body shape is an important modality-shared cue for VI-ReID. However, relying only on body shape is not sufficient. The authors propose to "erase" body shape information to force the model to discover other discriminative and modality-shared semantic concepts. - The paper proposes a shape-erased feature learning paradigm to decorrelate the features into two orthogonal subspaces - shape-related and shape-erased. - By jointly learning objectives for the two subspaces, the diversity of the representation can be enhanced - the shape-erased features are forced to find complementary discriminative cues not related to body shape.- The central hypothesis is that this explicit forcing of the model to discover diverse modality-shared concepts will improve VI-ReID performance compared to just reducing modality discrepancy.In summary, the key hypothesis is that erasing body shape information and decorrelating the features will enhance discovery of diverse and discriminative modality-shared concepts, leading to better VI-ReID performance. The experiments aim to validate if this approach is more effective than prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the key contributions of this paper:1. The paper proposes a shape-erased feature learning paradigm for visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID). The key idea is to decorrelate the learned features into two orthogonal subspaces - one for shape-related features and one for shape-erased features. 2. By learning shape-related features in one subspace guided by body shape priors, the shape-erased features are forced to discover other modality-shared discriminative semantic concepts in the orthogonal subspace. This enhances the diversity of the learned representation.3. The paper formulates the shape-erased feature learning from a mutual information perspective and shows that jointly optimizing the shape-related and shape-erased objectives maximizes the conditional mutual information between shape-erased features and identity while discarding body shape information. 4. The proposed method called Shape-Guided Diverse Feature Learning (SGIEL) jointly optimizes shape-related and shape-erased objectives to learn a modality-shared and discriminative representation.5. Extensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets - SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and HITSZ-VCM demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, the key contribution is a new shape-erased feature learning paradigm that explicitly enhances feature diversity by decomposing the representation into orthogonal shape-related and shape-erased subspaces. This is shown to improve performance on multiple VI-ReID datasets.
