# [Improving Adversarial Data Collection by Supporting Annotators: Lessons   from GAHD, a German Hate Speech Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Hate speech detection models struggle with weaknesses like lexical overfitting and poor generalizability due to biases and gaps in the datasets they are trained on.  
- Dynamic adversarial data collection (DADC) can address this by having annotators create texts to trick a target model, then retraining the model on the new data. However, DADC is inefficient, expensive, and can yield homogeneous data.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce GAHD, a new German Adversarial Hate Speech Dataset with 10,996 examples collected over 4 rounds of improved DADC:
   - R1: Unguided creation
   - R2: Annotators validate machine translations of English adversarial examples  
   - R3: Annotators validate German news sentences incorrectly labeled as hate speech by the target model
   - R4: Annotators create contrastive examples by modifying challenging examples to flip labels
- Explore strategies to support annotators to find diverse adversarial examples more efficiently 

Contributions:
1) Introduce GAHD dataset for German hate speech detection
2) Propose strategies to improve efficiency and effectiveness of DADC data collection 
3) Demonstrate GAHD improves model robustness - 20 pp increase in macro F1
4) Find mixing support strategies leads to more consistent improvements 
5) Benchmark performance of commercial APIs and large language models on GAHD

In summary, the paper presents a new German adversarial hate speech dataset collected with an improved DADC process to create a resource for developing more robust models. Experiments validate the usefulness of the dataset and strategies proposed.
