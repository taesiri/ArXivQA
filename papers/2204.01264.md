# [Probabilistic Implicit Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01264)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a scalable approach for probabilistic 3D scene completion that can generate diverse yet plausible complete shapes from incomplete observed data?The key aspects of this research question are:- Probabilistic 3D scene completion: The goal is to complete 3D scenes, which contain multiple objects, in a probabilistic way that produces multiple potential shape completions rather than just a single complete shape. This accounts for the inherent ambiguity when trying to complete shapes from incomplete data. - Diverse yet plausible completions: The approach aims to generate varied completions that cover the different plausible modes for completing the shape. However, the completions should still look realistic and plausible.- Scalable approach: Since they are tackling scene completion, the method needs to be able to scale to large 3D scenes with many objects. This requires efficiently representing the shape and incremental generation.- From incomplete observed data: The starting point is some partial observed data, such as an incomplete 3D scan, that provides a subset of shape information. The approach then tries to complete the full shape from this limited input.So in summary, the key research question is focused on developing a probabilistic, multi-modal scene completion approach that can produce realistic results in a scalable way from incomplete 3D input data. The paper aims to address the challenges associated with this through their proposed continuous Generative Cellular Automata method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The authors propose continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA), which is a generative model for probabilistic shape completion of large-scale 3D scenes. It can generate diverse and continuous surface geometry from incomplete point cloud inputs. 2. cGCA represents shapes using a sparse voxel embedding, where each occupied voxel contains a latent code to represent the local implicit surface. The authors propose training objectives and procedures to learn the distribution over sparse voxel embeddings.3. The authors formally prove that their training procedure maximizes a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of the complete shape distribution. This theoretically justifies cGCA as a valid generative model.4. Through experiments, the authors demonstrate that cGCA can generate high quality and diverse scene completions, especially for inputs with significant missing data. It outperforms previous deterministic models in terms of accuracy and detail.5. To my knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the challenging problem of probabilistic scene completion, which requires capturing the context of the whole scene and generating multi-modal outputs. The sparse representation used by cGCA provides better scalability compared to dense 3D convolution.In summary, the key contribution is proposing cGCA, a generative model for completing 3D scenes, which combines a sparse representation, probabilistic formulation, and provable training procedure. The experiments highlight the benefits of this approach, especially for ambiguous inputs.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in 3D shape completion:- This paper tackles the problem of probabilistic scene completion, generating multiple complete and diverse 3D scene geometries from partial input scans. Most prior work has focused on deterministic completion of single objects, not full scenes. - The method uses a generative model (continuous Generative Cellular Automata) that is theoretically justified as approximating maximum likelihood training. This provides a principled probabilistic approach compared to heuristic or deterministic techniques.- The model operates directly on large-scale continuous geometry using implicit function representations. Many previous scene completion methods rely on voxel or point cloud inputs, which are more limited in resolution and completeness.- Experiments demonstrate scalability to large indoor environments and robust performance even with high amounts of missing data. This shows an advantage over methods that cannot handle highly incomplete inputs or large scenes well.- The approach does not require a sliding window technique to divide the scene like some previous methods. It can complete full rooms simultaneously, maintaining global context.- Compared to the conference paper on Generative Cellular Automata, this work adds continuous geometry generation and provides more formal theoretical justification for the training procedure.Overall, the key advantages of this paper seem to be the probabilistic modeling of full 3D scenes allowing diverse outputs, the scalability to large environments, and the capability to generate high-quality continuous surfaces. The theoretical analysis of the training is also more rigorous than related generative modeling approaches. This allows more robust and complete scene reconstruction from very incomplete scans.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Testing the model on real-world data using self-supervised learning rather than synthetic datasets with complete ground truth data. The authors suggest training the model on datasets like ScanNet or Matterport3D that have been altered to have different levels of completeness.- Developing an end-to-end training procedure rather than the two-stage training used in the paper, where the transition kernel is trained separately after pre-training the autoencoder. An end-to-end approach could simplify the training.- Reducing the number of transitions required during inference to accelerate runtime, using an approach like that in Salimans et al. (2022). The current model requires multiple transitions which increases inference time compared to prior methods.- Exploring more powerful implicit shape representations like SIREN rather than the distance fields used in the paper. This could potentially improve the expressiveness and reconstruction quality.- Extending the approach to handle topology changes during completion, rather than assuming a fixed topology based on the input.- Applying the model to tasks beyond shape completion, such as shape generation and editing by manipulating the latent codes.In summary, the main future directions focus on scaling the approach to real-world data, simplifying the training procedure, accelerating inference, improving shape representation capabilities, and extending the model to other tasks like shape generation. Testing the approach on real-world data appears to be a key next step suggested by the authors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a probabilistic shape completion method called continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA) that can generate multiple continuous surfaces for 3D reconstruction. The method builds on Generative Cellular Automata (GCA) but overcomes its limitation of discrete voxel resolution by generating sparse voxels associated with latent codes representing local implicit fields. During training, the model learns to generate diverse sparse voxels that can be decoded into continuous surfaces. For shape completion, cGCA progressively grows the shape by sampling stochastic transition kernels to generate new voxels in the neighborhood of existing ones. The training objective is derived to maximize a variational lower bound on the complete shape distribution. Experiments show cGCA can generate diverse yet detailed continuous surfaces even for large-scale scenes with significant missing data. A key advantage over deterministic methods is the ability to produce multiple plausible reconstructions. The probabilistic formulation is shown to be important even for less ambiguous inputs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a probabilistic shape completion method called continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA) that can generate diverse and continuous surfaces for 3D reconstruction. The method builds on previous work in Generative Cellular Automata (GCA) but overcomes limitations in resolution by generating a continuous surface represented with implicit fields. Specifically, the method represents shapes as a sparse voxel embedding, where each occupied voxel contains a latent code that encodes the local implicit field. An autoencoder is used to convert between the sparse voxel embedding and the implicit field. To generate shapes, cGCA employs a sampling procedure that progressively updates local neighborhoods of voxels to grow the shape. The training objective is derived to maximize a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of the complete shape distribution. This allows cGCA to model the multi-modal distribution of shapes conditioned on a partial observation.Experiments demonstrate that cGCA can generate high quality and diverse scene completions even when the input point cloud is highly incomplete. The continuous surface representation also captures greater detail compared to voxel-based methods like GCA. cGCA is also shown to be more scalable than dense convolutional networks for large scenes. The probabilistic formulation is shown to be advantageous compared to deterministic regression, producing less blurry outputs. The model generalizes well to real-world indoor scans. In conclusion, cGCA presents a scalable generative model for multi-modal continuous shape completion that produces high quality results even with very incomplete input scans.
