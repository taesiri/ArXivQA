# [Probabilistic Implicit Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01264)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a scalable approach for probabilistic 3D scene completion that can generate diverse yet plausible complete shapes from incomplete observed data?The key aspects of this research question are:- Probabilistic 3D scene completion: The goal is to complete 3D scenes, which contain multiple objects, in a probabilistic way that produces multiple potential shape completions rather than just a single complete shape. This accounts for the inherent ambiguity when trying to complete shapes from incomplete data. - Diverse yet plausible completions: The approach aims to generate varied completions that cover the different plausible modes for completing the shape. However, the completions should still look realistic and plausible.- Scalable approach: Since they are tackling scene completion, the method needs to be able to scale to large 3D scenes with many objects. This requires efficiently representing the shape and incremental generation.- From incomplete observed data: The starting point is some partial observed data, such as an incomplete 3D scan, that provides a subset of shape information. The approach then tries to complete the full shape from this limited input.So in summary, the key research question is focused on developing a probabilistic, multi-modal scene completion approach that can produce realistic results in a scalable way from incomplete 3D input data. The paper aims to address the challenges associated with this through their proposed continuous Generative Cellular Automata method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The authors propose continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA), which is a generative model for probabilistic shape completion of large-scale 3D scenes. It can generate diverse and continuous surface geometry from incomplete point cloud inputs. 2. cGCA represents shapes using a sparse voxel embedding, where each occupied voxel contains a latent code to represent the local implicit surface. The authors propose training objectives and procedures to learn the distribution over sparse voxel embeddings.3. The authors formally prove that their training procedure maximizes a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of the complete shape distribution. This theoretically justifies cGCA as a valid generative model.4. Through experiments, the authors demonstrate that cGCA can generate high quality and diverse scene completions, especially for inputs with significant missing data. It outperforms previous deterministic models in terms of accuracy and detail.5. To my knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the challenging problem of probabilistic scene completion, which requires capturing the context of the whole scene and generating multi-modal outputs. The sparse representation used by cGCA provides better scalability compared to dense 3D convolution.In summary, the key contribution is proposing cGCA, a generative model for completing 3D scenes, which combines a sparse representation, probabilistic formulation, and provable training procedure. The experiments highlight the benefits of this approach, especially for ambiguous inputs.
