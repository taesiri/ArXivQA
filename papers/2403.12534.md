# [ExACT: Language-guided Conceptual Reasoning and Uncertainty Estimation   for Event-based Action Recognition and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing event-based action recognition methods have difficulties in recognizing actions with prolonged duration and complex/ambiguous semantics. This is due to:
1) Lack of ability to model the temporal relations between sub-actions that unfold over time to understand the meaning of full actions.  
2) Redundant event frame representations with fixed stacking, leading to overlapped actions in frames.
3) Failure to reduce the semantic uncertainty of dynamic actions involving multiple sub-actions.

Proposed Solution - ExACT Framework:
1) Adaptive Fine-grained Event (AFE) Representation: Adaptively eliminates redundant events to generate detailed frames of dynamic actions based on observed 'overlapped action regions'.  

2) Conceptual Reasoning-based Uncertainty Estimation (CRUE) Module: Leverages language guidance to a) establish temporal relations between events using conceptual reasoning to understand an action's semantics, b) converts events/text to distributional representations to quantify semantic uncertainty.

3) New Semantic-Abundant Event Action (SeAct) dataset: Provides detailed text captions to evaluate ability to recognize complex actions.

Key Contributions:  
1) First cross-modal framework for event-based action recognition using language to guide conceptual reasoning and uncertainty modeling.

2) Adaptive event representation filtering and CRUE module to create semantic-rich, uncertainty-aware embedding space.

3) SeAct - first event-text action recognition benchmark with detailed captions.

4) Superior results on public datasets, especially 300-class HARDVS (+37.47% accuracy) and plausible 67.24% accuracy on SeAct dataset.

5) Framework is flexible for other event-text tasks like retrieval.
