# [Revisiting the Optimality of Word Lengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There has been a longstanding debate about what principle drives the lengths of words in languages. Two main hypotheses have been proposed:
    1) Zipf's "law of abbreviation": Word lengths are optimized to minimize expected utterance lengths. This predicts word length should be inversely correlated with word frequency.
    2) Piantadosi et al.'s "channel capacity hypothesis" (CCH): Word lengths aim to keep information rate close to channel capacity. This predicts word length should correlate with a word's expected surprisal (negative log probability).
- Formalizing and comparing these hypotheses has been difficult. Prior work has struggled with issues like model estimation, tokenization schemes, etc. 

Proposed Solution
- The authors formalize the problem of assigning wordforms as an optimization problem called the "lexicalization problem". 
- They provide a novel derivation for the CCH, showing it actually optimizes a lower bound (\costlower). Their new derivation suggests word length should correlate with expected surprisal PLUS the variance-to-mean ratio of surprisal.  
- They propose a unified framework to derive predictions from both hypotheses and empirically compare them.

Main Contributions
- Show Piantadosi et al. optimize a lower bound, not CCH directly. Provide better derivation for CCH.
- Empirically compare hypotheses over 13 languages with improved surprisal estimates from neural models.
- Find strong evidence Zipf's hypothesis holds across settings - word frequency has more predictive power over lengths than surprisal-based quantities. 
- Conclude lexical optimization aims to minimize expected utterance lengths rather than keep information rate near channel capacity.
