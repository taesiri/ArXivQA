# [SKT5SciSumm - A Hybrid Generative Approach for Multi-Document Scientific   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Summarization of scientific text is important to help researchers stay updated, but is challenging due to the distinct nature of scientific writing and long input texts in multi-document summarization.  
- Existing methods face issues with capturing content, maintaining relationships between documents, and generating high-quality summaries.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose SKT5SciSumm, a hybrid framework combining unsupervised extractive summarization and supervised abstractive summarization.
- Uses SPECTER sentence embeddings with k-means clustering for extractive summarization to remove irrelevant information and reduce sentence count.
- Fine-tunes T5 transformer models on extracted sentences to generate abstractive summaries.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a simple yet effective hybrid approach for multi-document scientific summarization, outperforming previous models.
- Compares different T5 model sizes, finding T5-Large achieves best performance.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Multi-XScience benchmark dataset.
- Showcases the ability of less complex models combined appropriately can surpass more complicated systems for this task.

In summary, the paper introduces SKT5SciSumm, a novel extract-abstract framework leveraging SPECTER, k-means and T5 that sets a new state-of-the-art for multi-document summarization of scientific texts. The simplicity yet strong performance highlights the potential of this method to advance scientific document summarization.
