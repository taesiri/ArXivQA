# [$C^3$: Confidence Calibration Model Cascade for Inference-Efficient   Cross-Lingual Natural Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15991)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Confidence Calibration Cascade (C3) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cross-lingual natural language understanding (NLU) models. 

Problem:
- Multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities for cross-lingual NLU. However, they have high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment. 
- Existing model cascade methods improve efficiency by greedily selecting the smallest capable model based on confidence scores. But deep models exhibit overconfidence, and confidence distributions vary across languages, leading to incorrect predictions.

Proposed Solution - C3:
- Introduces a calibration step prior to cascade inference to align confidence distributions across languages and models. 
- During training, a logit normalization layer is added to alleviate overconfidence. 
- During inference, a temperature scaling step adjusts logits to calibrate model predictions.
- This enhances reliability of confidence scores for better model selection in the cascade.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on 3 text classification datasets (XNLI, PAWS-X, QAM) and 2 generation datasets (GSM8k, TabMWP) covering 5 languages.
- Compared to SOTA methods like PABEE, DeeBERT and CascadeBERT.
- C3 improves accuracy by 4-8% absolutely across benchmarks and languages. 
- Reduces calibration error (ECE) by 40% compared to vanilla cascades.
- Achieves 98% of BERT performance at half compute costs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes C3, a flexible framework to enhance cross-lingual inference efficiency through confidence calibration
- Introduces calibration techniques specialized for both encoder and decoder PLMs
- Extensive experiments show C3 outperforms SOTA baselines significantly across diverse cross-lingual tasks
