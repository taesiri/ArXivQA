# [Corruption Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of corruption robustness in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, an agent learns a policy from offline dataset of human preferences over trajectory pairs. This is useful in many applications where reward functions are hard to specify. However, the preference data can be noisy or even adversarially corrupted. The paper aims to design RLHF algorithms that are robust to such corruption.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to robustify the existing RLHF pipeline by - (1) learning a reward model along with confidence sets using robust logistic regression, and (2) learning a pessimistic optimal policy over the confidence set by reduction to corruption robust offline RL. Different assumptions on dataset coverage require different reductions.

Key Contributions:

- Under uniform coverage assumption, the method achieves $O(\varepsilon^{1-o(1)})$ suboptimality gap, where $\varepsilon$ is the corruption level. This uses an existing offline RL method as a blackbox.

- Under low relative condition number assumption, a weaker assumption than uniform coverage, the method achieves $O(\varepsilon^{1/4})$ gap. This requires a new reduction using biased zero-order optimization with corruption robust offline RL.

- Under bounded generalized coverage ratio assumption, which is incomparable to low relative condition number, the method achieves improved $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ gap. This requires a new corruption robust offline RL method based on robust primal-dual updates. 

- The reductions connect corruption robust offline RL and RLHF. The new offline RL method may be of independent interest. Together, it provides the first provably robust offline RLHF methods under dataset corruption.
