# [Let's Learn Step by Step: Enhancing In-Context Learning Ability with   Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Let's Learn Step by Step: Enhancing In-Context Learning Ability with Curriculum Learning":

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to perform complex tasks using a prompt with a few demonstration examples. However, the order/complexity of demonstrations can significantly impact performance. 
- Prior work on optimizing demonstration order requires additional knowledge and computations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose an In-Context Curriculum Learning (ICCL) approach where demonstrations are ordered from simple to complex to gradually teach the LLM. 
- ICCL keeps model parameters fixed and only modifies demonstration order to maximize "parameter efficiency" - performance given fixed parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Show ICCL improves performance of open-source LLMs on scientific text tasks (by 1.91% F1 on average). More effective for larger models.
- Find that ICCL capability is developed during instruction tuning stage rather than in pre-training.
- Show human-crafted curriculum schedule is far more effective than LLM self-generated schedules, highlighting value of human guidance.

In summary, the paper introduces a simple but effective approach of curriculum-based demonstration ordering for in-context learning. Key findings are 1) ICCL improves LLM performance, with benefits growing for larger models 2) ICCL ability develops during instruction tuning 3) human guidance plays an important role in designing effective curriculum schedules.
