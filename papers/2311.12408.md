# [Autonomous Exploration of Unknown 3D Environments Using a Frontier-Based   Collector Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12408)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel autonomous exploration strategy for unknown 3D environments using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The method combines frontier-based exploration, which ensures global coverage, with a collector strategy that stores, filters, and selects the best frontiers to balance exploitation of known areas and exploration of unknown spaces. The collector strategy utilizes proximity, obstruction, and information gain checkers to filter frontier candidates. For safe navigation, the approach incorporates an online path replanning algorithm to handle inaccuracies in the incrementally built map. The performance is evaluated in simulated warehouse environments and complex outdoor spaces, showing improved efficiency and coverage compared to greedy and multi-resolution frontier methods. Notably, the proposed technique achieves over 97% coverage on a complex warehouse map. The approach is also validated on a real UAV with limited onboard resources, demonstrating its effectiveness for practical autonomous exploration tasks requiring thorough mapping. Key innovations include the collector strategy for efficient frontier selection and online replanning for reliable obstacle avoidance given map uncertainties during exploration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel autonomous exploration strategy for unknown 3D environments that balances exploiting known areas and exploring unknown spaces using a frontier-based collector approach and replanning for obstacle avoidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A collector strategy that stores, filters and selects the best frontier during exploration. It ensures complete map acquisition and balances the exploitation of known map data and the exploration of unknown areas.

2) An online replanning algorithm that allows continuous checking of path validity and replanning when needed. It ensures the execution of collision-free paths and thus safe navigation.

3) Evaluation and demonstration of the proposed approach in both simulation and a real-world experiment.

So in summary, the main contributions are a new collector exploration strategy, an online replanning algorithm, and validation of the approach through simulations and real-world experiments. The key ideas are balancing exploration and exploitation, and enabling safe navigation through replanning.
