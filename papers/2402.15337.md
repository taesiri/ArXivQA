# [Ranking Entities along Conceptual Space Dimensions with LLMs: An   Analysis of Fine-Tuning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of primitive semantic features like perceptual and subjective properties. However, learning such spaces is very challenging, especially for properties like taste, color, scariness etc. where ground truth rankings are rare. 

- Existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting, without fine-tuning. It is unclear if fine-tuning can help LLMs better learn to rank entities along conceptual space dimensions.

Method:
- The paper explores fine-tuning strategies for ranking entities along features like sweetness, population etc. It compares pointwise and pairwise fine-tuning. 

- Pointwise method assigns a score to each entity indicating its quality for a feature. Pairwise compares entity pairs to decide order.

- Models fine-tuned on numerical attributes from Wikidata are analyzed for transfer learning to perceptual features.

Contributions:
- Shows fine-tuning on one domain (e.g. taste) helps transfer to unseen domains (e.g. rocks), if both are perceptual. Transfer is limited from numerical to perceptual features.

- Surprisingly, pointwise ranking is very competitive to pairwise approaches for entity ranking with LLMs, unlike document ranking.

- Evaluates on new datasets of rocks, movies, books beyond existing taste and physical properties datasets.

- Shows sample efficient SVM method to aggregate pairwise judgments for ranking.

Overall, provides analysis to show pre-trained LLMs can effectively learn to rank entities along conceptual space dimensions with suitable fine-tuning strategies.
