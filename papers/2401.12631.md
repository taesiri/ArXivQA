# [A Reply to Makelov et al. (2023)'s "Interpretability Illusion" Arguments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12631)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
This paper responds to a recent paper by Aleksandar Makelov et al. (2023) which argued that distributed alignment search (DAS) methods for neural network interpretability can give rise to "interpretability illusions". Specifically, Makelov et al. claimed that DAS can make neurons that are causally disconnected in a normal run of the model come to play causally efficacious roles when DAS interventions are performed. They view these situations as "illusions" that should be avoided.

In this paper, Wu et al. disagree with the "illusion" characterization. They argue that these phenomena simply reflect interesting facts about how distributed representations work in neural networks. The core insight is that "illusory" effects will generically arise unless representations are strictly orthogonal to nullspaces of model components, which is an unrealistic requirement. Thus, the "illusions" Makelov et al. identify are expected, not problematic.

Proposed Solution  
Wu et al. make several main arguments:

1) They formally analyze Makelov et al.'s definition of an "interpretability illusion", showing that even intuitive causal explanations could qualify as illusions. Thus, the definition risks rejecting reasonable explanations.

2) The "illusions" Makelov et al. see likely stem from deficiencies in their training and evaluation procedures, rather than fundamental issues with DAS. For instance, Makelov et al. train DAS on only a single example pair.

3) Wu et al. present additional analyses on the indirect object identification task, using DAS to gain new insights. Their results support distributed representations and suggest that the "name position" variable emerges across multiple attention heads.

Main Contributions
- Formal analysis showing that Makelov et al.'s "illusion" definition is too broad
- Argument that claimed illusions likely originate from limitations of Makelov et al.'s experiments 
- New analyses providing insights into distributed representations in transformer models

Overall, while disagreeing with the "illusion" terminology, Wu et al. praise Makelov et al.'s contribution in spurring valuable research directions. The discussion helps elucidate important open questions regarding distributed representations and interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper responds to a recent critique of distributed alignment search methods for neural network interpretability, arguing that the "interpretability illusions" identified are actually just inherent properties of how networks represent information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper responds to and disagrees with the claims made in a recent paper by Aleksandar Makelov et al. about "interpretability illusions" arising from distributed alignment search (DAS). The main contributions are:

1) The authors argue that the "illusions" identified by Makelov et al. are not actually illusions, but rather discoveries about how distributed representations work in neural networks. They are facts about network geometry that methods like DAS should aim to uncover.

2) The authors show examples where even intuitive, non-illusory explanations would qualify as "illusions" under Makelov et al.'s definitions. They argue the definitions are too broad. 

3) The authors critique the experimental setup used by Makelov et al. to demonstrate "illusions" in real language models like GPT-2. They argue the evidence for illusions arising in practice is weak.

4) The authors present additional analyses on the indirect object identification task to reproduce prior findings and provide new insights into the causal mechanisms in GPT-2 for this task.

In summary, the main contribution is a rebuttal of the "interpretability illusion" arguments, combined with new analyses that aim to further research in interpretability. While disagreeing with the "illusion" labeling, the authors see the discussion as productive for the field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Interpretability illusions - The paper discusses and responds to the concept of "interpretability illusions" proposed by Aleksandar Makelov et al. This refers to situations where distributed interchange interventions appear to reveal causally efficacious roles for neurons that are actually causally disconnected. 

- Distributed interchange interventions - Methods like Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) that intervene on subspaces/sets of neurons rather than individual neurons.

- Activation patching/interchange interventions - Classical methods that intervene on individual neurons.

- Indirect object identification (IOI) task - A language task used to evaluate model explanations, involving identifying indirect objects in sentences. 

- Factual recall task - Another language task used, involving prompting a model with an incomplete fact and checking if it can recall the missing element.

- Interchange intervention accuracy (IIA) - A metric used to quantify how well a high-level causal model aligns with a neural network's behavior under interventions.

- Distributed representations - Representations defined over patterns of activations across multiple neurons, as opposed to single units.

- Causal abstraction - The framework of explaining a neural network by aligning it with a high-level causal model. 

- Multiple causal abstractions - The possibility of multiple high-level models being accurate abstractions of the same low-level neural network.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that "illusory effects" arise naturally from the geometry of representations in neural networks. Can you elaborate more on the connection between the data-induced submanifold and the downstream computation's nullspace? Why does their relative orientation matter for determining illusory versus non-illusory effects?

2. Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) assumes linear subspaces for alignments. However, the paper shows even intuitive non-illusory directions may not fit neatly into a linear subspace. How can methods like Boundless DAS address such issues? What are the tradeoffs? 

3. The paper suggests "illusory effects" may simply reflect facts about how networks represent information. Could these effects potentially be useful signals for understanding processing in neural networks? Might we want to design networks to produce more of these effects?

4. How exactly does the notion of "multiple causal abstractions" relate to the presence of illusory directions under the definition given in the paper? Walk through the connection in detail.

5. The paper argues fractional logit difference decrease (FLDD) can be misleading for assessing counterfactual behavior. What specific alternative evaluation metrics might better capture the causal effects of interventions? How could these avoid the pitfalls of FLDD?

6. Activation analysis shows correlations but does not directly demonstrate causation. Besides interchange interventions, what additional analyses could help bolster causal claims about which components carry critical information in models like GPT-2?  

7. The paper claims the factual recall experiments only align models in uninteresting ways. But might simply reproducing answers provide some signal about storage of factual knowledge in models? How could the experiments be improved to be more meaningful?

8. Why might the distribution of DAS weights, as shown in Fig. 5, serve as a useful diagnostic for assessing the distributed nature of representations? When might outliers in the distribution suggest issues in learning accurate alignments?

9. The IOI analyses surface multi-headed attention as a likely locus of information combination in GPT-2. How well would these methods extend to analyze information flow in models with very different architectures like RNNs or transformers without multi-headed attention?

10. The paper focuses on linear methods for finding alignments but notes binary variables may not fit neatly into linear subspaces. What nonlinear alignment methods might prove most effective? What challenges arise in scaling these?
