# [Multi-line AI-assisted Code Authoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper discusses the challenges with scaling CodeCompose, an AI-assisted code authoring tool at Meta, from providing single-line code suggestions to multi-line code suggestions. Providing multi-line suggestions introduces several challenges:

1) Multi-line suggestions can shift around code the developer has already written, causing a "jarring effect" that disrupts developers and lowers productivity/satisfaction. 

2) Multi-line suggestions take much longer to generate from large language models (LLMs). The added latency reduces the number of suggestions users actually see before dismissing them by typing more code.

3) Evaluating whether multi-line suggestions provide a net benefit to developers compared to single-line, given the increased latency and disruption.

Proposed Solution:

1) Develop a scope-based algorithm to trigger multi-line suggestions only at semantic block boundaries, and limit suggestions to the current scope. This eliminates shifting around developers' existing code.  

2) Optimize the system - client, server middleware, and model hosting - to reduce multi-line latency from 2+ seconds to 750ms. Add a UI spinner indicator so developers know a suggestion is coming.

3) Extensively A/B test multi-line suggestions with 10,000s of Meta engineers to evaluate productivity/acceptance compared to single line. Monitor metrics on acceptance rate, keystrokes saved, and lines of code accepted.

Main Contributions:

1) Algorithm to provide multi-line code suggestions with minimal disruption 

2) System optimizations that reduce multi-line latency by 60%, increasing usage

3) A/B testing showing multi-line suggestions account for 42% of code accepted from CodeCompose and nearly double keystrokes saved from 9% to 17%, despite significant latency challenges.

In summary, the paper details a successful rollout of multi-line AI coding assistance to thousands of engineers by overcoming algorithmic, system latency, and rigorous experimental evaluation challenges unique to suggesting multiple lines of code contextually.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents how Meta scaled their AI-assisted code authoring tool CodeCompose from displaying single-line suggestions to multi-line suggestions by overcoming challenges related to usability, latency, and measuring effectiveness through large-scale online experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing and deploying a scope-based multi-line code suggestion algorithm for an AI-assisted coding tool at Meta. Specifically:

1) It details an algorithm to trigger multi-line code suggestions only at the end of semantic scopes in code, and limit suggestions to the end of the current scope. This avoids the "jarring effect" of suggestions constantly shifting code around. 

2) It describes optimizations made to the model serving infrastructure, like Flash Attention and streaming responses, to reduce the latency of multi-line suggestions down to 750ms median. This made the suggestions more responsive and increased user adoption.

3) It presents results from A/B experiments during rollout showing that multi-line suggestions account for 42% of accepted characters from users, nearly double their 16% share of displayed suggestions. This validates their disproportionate impact in increasing developer productivity despite higher latency.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating a production-ready multi-line code suggestion experience that increases developer productivity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- CodeCompose: The AI-assisted code authoring tool developed at Meta that provides inline code suggestions to developers
- Large language models (LLMs): The type of neural network models that power CodeCompose's code suggestions
- Multi-line suggestions: Code suggestions spanning multiple lines of code, compared to single-line suggestions on just one line
- User interface experience: Optimizing the developer experience when using multi-line suggestions to avoid a "jarring effect"
- Perceived latency: Reducing the time developers have to wait for multi-line suggestions to appear 
- Model hosting optimizations: Technical improvements to reduce the latency of generating multi-line suggestions 
- A/B testing: Methodology used to evaluate the impact of multi-line suggestions by comparing metrics between groups of developers
- Acceptance rate: Percentage of suggestions displayed that are accepted by developers
- Keystrokes saved: Metric tracking the percentage of keystrokes developers save by accepting suggestions
- User feedback: Qualitative assessments gathered from developers on their experience with multi-line suggestions

The core focus is on adding multi-line code suggestions to CodeCompose and evaluating the impact on developers compared to only having single-line suggestions. Key challenges include avoiding disruption to developers' workflow, reducing suggestion latency, and measuring effectiveness after rollout.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions adhering to strict design principles of not being intrusive and fitting seamlessly into the existing user experience when handling multi-line suggestions. Can you expand more on the specific design principles followed beyond just eliminating the "jarring effect"? What other design considerations were kept in mind?

2. In the scope-based multi-line algorithm, what are some examples of other programming constructs besides functions and if statements that you treat as scopes when determining if a multi-line suggestion should be triggered? How do you handle cases like classes or try/catch blocks? 

3. When exactly is the post-processing step applied on the raw responses from the large language model? Is it on every request or only on certain multi-line requests? What are some examples of adjustments made during post-processing?

4. For the inline loading indicator, how did you determine the thresholds for when to show or hide it? Did you experiment with showing it only for suggestions above a certain length? How do you balance indication with being too distracting?

5. In the model hosting optimizations like batching and streaming, what criteria did you use to determine the optimal batch size for requests? Were certain request types batched differently? 

6. When monitoring metrics during experimentation, what other metrics did you track beyond what was reported in the paper? Did you look into metrics on code quality or other proxy effectiveness measures?

7. What other multi-line trigger strategies did you experiment with beyond being at the end of a scope? For example, triggering mid-scope based on predicting a user's intent. How successful were they?

8. For users that opted out of multi-line suggestions, did you survey them on their reasons for opting out? What feedback did they provide and how are you addressing it?

9. How do you balance investing engineering effort into improving multi-line suggestions vs improving single-line suggestions? What factors determine where most marginal gains can be achieved?

10. Now that multi-line is launched, what are the next major initiatives planned around CodeCompose? Are you focused on improvements to the model, UX, or infrastructure hosting? What is the long term vision?
