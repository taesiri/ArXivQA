# [Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search for Partially Observable   Multi-agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) in a decentralized, lifelong setting. Specifically, it considers the scenario where agents operate with only partial observability of the environment and other agents. The agents are assigned goals continuously as they complete previous ones. Existing solutions either rely on centralized planning which scales poorly or learnable policies which generalize poorly. The paper aims to develop a decentralized method that can efficiently solve challenging lifelong MAPF instances. 

Method:
The paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method called MATS-LP. The key idea is to combine MCTS for long-term planning with a lightweight neural network policy for state evaluation. Each agent constructs an intrinsic Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on its partial observability and performs MCTS by simulating possible futures using the learned policy (called CostTracer). To scale planning, MATS-LP considers joint actions only for a few nearby agents and uses a greedy policy for distant agents. The CostTracer policy is trained using the PPO reinforcement learning algorithm with a compact network.

Main Contributions:
- A decentralized planning approach for lifelong MAPF using Monte Carlo tree search and a learned simulation policy
- A technique to construct intrinsic MDPs from partial observability and focus MCTS on nearby agents for scalability
- The CostTracer neural policy tailored for efficient state evaluation in MCTS using 161K parameters 
- Empirical evaluation showing MATS-LP outperforming state-of-the-art primal and learning based MAPF solvers on challenging random, maze, and warehouse maps

The main strengths of MATS-LP are its ability to find coordinated plans despite partial observability and its better generalization compared to learned policies. The results demonstrate the promise of combining search and learning for decentralized sequential decision making problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search method with a learned simulation policy for lifelong multi-agent pathfinding in partially observable environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a decentralized multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method for solving Lifelong Multi-Agent Pathfinding (LMAPF) tasks. Specifically:

- The paper presents a decentralized MCTS approach where each agent constructs an intrinsic Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on its egocentric observations and plans actions using MCTS on this intrinsic MDP. This allows the agents to reason about possible future states and choose actions that maximize chances of reaching goals while avoiding conflicts.

- The MCTS uses a tailored lightweight neural network policy called CostTracer to evaluate states and provide action probabilities during tree search. This policy is pre-trained using proximal policy optimization. Using a lightweight policy allows efficient simulation of future states.

- The method limits MCTS planning to only nearby agents to simplify decision making. Distant agents' actions are selected greedily based on the CostTracer policy. 

- Empirical evaluation shows the proposed method, called MATS-LP, outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized LMAPF solvers like Primal2 and SCRIMP on challenging benchmarks. This demonstrates it can achieve good coordination and generalization without explicit communication.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a decentralized MCTS approach that combines search and a learned policy for efficient coordination and planning in lifelong multi-agent pathfinding tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method for lifelong MAPF tasks. What are the key advantages of using a decentralized approach compared to centralized planning methods? How does it help address the challenges in lifelong MAPF settings?

2. The method utilizes an intrinsic Markov Decision Process (MDP) constructed using the agent's egocentric observations. Explain the process of constructing this intrinsic MDP. Why is it useful to plan using such an intrinsic MDP rather than the full global state?

3. The paper employs an action masking technique based on the proximity of agents. Explain this technique and how it simplifies the decision-making process. How does the number of expansions scale with increasing number of nearby agents?

4. What is the role of the CostTracer policy learned using PPO? Why is it important for this policy to be lightweight and fast to execute? How is it utilized within the MCTS framework?

5. Walk through the three key stages of the MCTS planning used in this method - selection, expansion and backpropagation. How are statistics updated and propagated in each stage? 

6. The node value estimates in MCTS combine both the value predicted by CostTracer and rewards obtained by simulating the intrinsic MDP. Why is this combination useful compared to using only one of the two estimates?

7. The paper compares the method against Primal2 and SCRIMP. Analyze the relative strengths and weaknesses seen in the results. On what types of maps does MATS-LP perform better or worse?

8. What do the ablation studies show regarding the importance of different components like proximal planning and the learned CostTracer policy? How does performance vary with number of MCTS expansions?

9. The decision time scales sub-linearly with number of agents, while throughput improves. Analyze this tradeoff between planning time and solution quality. How can this time be adjusted based on requirements?

10. What are some promising future research directions suggested? Can you think of any other extensions or improvements to the method?
