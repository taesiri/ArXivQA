# [A General Theory for Kernel Packets: from state space model to compactly   supported basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Gaussian process (GP) regression is computationally intensive, with O(n^3) training time and O(n) prediction time for n data points. State-space (SS) models can reduce training time to O(n), but prediction is still O(n). The goal is to develop efficient and exact methods for GP regression, with low training and prediction complexities.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the concept of kernel packets (KPs) - linear combinations of covariance functions that become compactly supported, analogous to compactly supported basis functions. It establishes an equivalence between:
(1) A GP characterized by an m-th order stochastic differential equation (SDE)  
(2) An m-dimensional state-space model formulation of that GP
(3) A set of KPs derived from that SDE that are compactly supported. 

It provides an algorithm to construct the KPs from a given SDE. Under mild conditions, these KPs form a basis for relevant function spaces, are guaranteed to be linearly independent, and reduce prediction complexity to O(log n) or even O(1).

Main Contributions:
- Establishes connection between SDE representation, state-space models and existence of compactly supported KPs for a GP
- Provides tractable algorithm to compute KP basis from a given SDE  
- Proof that the resulting KPs form a basis, are linearly independent and compactly supported
- Exact GP regression methodology with O(n) training and O(log n) or O(1) prediction complexity
- Extensions for combined kernels and potential for multi-dimensional kernels

The compact support of the KPs, while retaining exact GP properties, is the key enabler for efficient computations. This offers a promising approach for scalable GP regression in problems where an SDE characterization is available.
