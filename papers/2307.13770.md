# [E^2VPT: An Effective and Efficient Approach for Visual Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13770)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the key points of this paper appear to be:

1. The paper focuses on parameter-efficient learning for large-scale vision models, particularly transformer-based architectures. As these models grow in size, fine-tuning them for new tasks becomes increasingly parameter-intensive.

2. The paper proposes a new approach called E2VPT (Effective and Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning) to address this challenge. 

3. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to achieve superior performance while using fewer parameters during fine-tuning. This is in contrast to prior work that has focused only on reducing parameters in a heuristic manner without considering model architecture.

4. E2VPT introduces learnable prompts into both the input and backbone (self-attention layers) of transformers. This is claimed to improve effectiveness by leveraging the architecture.

5. E2VPT also employs prompt pruning to remove unnecessary prompts, improving efficiency. This explores the extremes of parameter usage during fine-tuning.

6. Empirical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of E2VPT, showing accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods while using far fewer parameters on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that architectural awareness and pruning can push prompt tuning to new frontiers of performance vs efficiency for fine-tuning large vision transformers. The paper aims to demonstrate this via the proposed E2VPT approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a mixed-prompt tuning approach for effective and efficient adaptation of large-scale transformer models for computer vision tasks. 

2. Introducing learnable key-value prompts into the self-attention layers of transformers, in addition to input visual prompts, to improve model adaptation. This allows capturing better interactions and patterns from the new data.

3. Designing a prompt pruning strategy with token-wise and segment-wise pruning to remove redundant prompts and improve parameter efficiency, while maintaining model performance. 

4. Demonstrating strong performance of the proposed approach over full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on image classification benchmarks, while using significantly fewer parameters (e.g. only 0.32% of model parameters on average).

5. Providing visualization and analysis to explain the effectiveness of the approach in learning better representations and separability for new tasks. 

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing an effective yet highly parameter-efficient prompt tuning approach for visual transformers, which carefully considers the architecture via prompts in self-attention and pruning for improved efficiency. The results demonstrate strong adaption performance at a fraction of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an effective and efficient visual prompt tuning (E2VPT) approach for large-scale transformer-based model adaptation, which introduces learnable key-value prompts into self-attention layers and visual prompts into input layers for improved effectiveness, and employs prompt pruning to reduce prompt parameters for higher efficiency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a mixed prompt tuning method for efficient visual transfer learning on large pretrained vision models. Here are some key points in comparing it to other related work:

1. Efficiency in transfer learning: This paper focuses on enabling efficient transfer learning for large vision models like Vision Transformers, to reduce the computational cost and carbon footprint. Many recent works have looked at efficient training techniques like model distillation, pruning, lightweight model designs etc. But this paper specifically targets prompt tuning for efficient transfer learning.

2. Prompt tuning: Prompt tuning has become popular in NLP, where task-specific prompt embeddings are added to model inputs for fast adaptation. For vision, prompt tuning is relatively new. This paper proposes mixed prompts - both visual and key-value prompts injected into vision transformer layers. The key-value prompts in self-attention are a novel idea not explored by prior visual prompt tuning works.

3. Pruning prompts: The paper also applies prompt pruning to eliminate redundant prompt tokens, making the prompt tuning even more efficient. Pruning prompts in this manner is unique to this work, not considered by other visual prompt tuning methods. 

4. Performance: The mixed prompt tuning method outperforms recent visual prompt tuning baselines like VPT, and even surpasses full fine-tuning on many datasets, despite using <1% trainable parameters. The hyperbolic visualizations also show the learned representations are more separable.

5. Scope: The technique is evaluated on multiple vision datasets (FGVC, VTAB) and backbones (ViT, Swin transformers). The promising results on both supervised and self-supervised models demonstrate its generalization ability.

In summary, the idea of mixed prompts with pruning provides new insights into efficient and effective prompt tuning for large vision models, advancing the state-of-the-art in this emerging research direction. The thorough evaluation methodology strengthens the paper.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

1. Exploring more efficient and effective prompting strategies for large transformer-based vision models. The authors propose using visual and key-value prompts for effective prompting, and pruning techniques for efficient prompting. But they suggest there is room for further improvements in prompt design to balance effectiveness and efficiency.

2. Investigating how to better leverage the self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning. The key innovation in this work is incorporating prompts into the self-attention layers. The authors suggest more work can be done to understand how to best utilize self-attention for adaptation tasks.

3. Designing prompting techniques specialized for hierarchical vision transformers. The authors show results on both the standard ViT and hierarchical Swin transformers. But they note that directly applying prompting techniques designed for ViT to Swin may not be optimal. More research could customize prompting specifically for hierarchical transformers.  

4. Exploring different pretraining objectives and architectures. The authors demonstrate their approach on supervised and self-supervised (MAE, MoCo) pretrained models using ViT and Swin backbones. They suggest examining other pretraining methods and backbone architectures.

5. Studying the explainability of prompt tuning methods via visualization techniques like they did with hyperbolic embedding. Better understanding why prompt tuning works could further improve design.

6. Applying prompt tuning to other domains beyond vision. The authors include some preliminary experiments on NLP tasks in the Appendix to demonstrate the generalization potential. But more in-depth exploration of prompting for other modalities could be valuable.

In summary, the authors propose a novel prompt tuning technique and demonstrate its effectiveness, but also outline many exciting avenues for future work to build on their approach and insights. Their work helps advance this emerging research area of efficient tuning of large pretained models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an effective and efficient visual prompt tuning (E2VPT) approach for fine-tuning large-scale transformer models on new vision tasks. The key ideas are: 1) In addition to input visual prompts, E2VPT introduces learnable key-value prompts into the self-attention layers, which helps better capture interactions and patterns for the new task. 2) A prompt pruning method is designed to reduce redundant parameters in the visual prompts while maintaining performance. Specifically, token-wise and segment-wise pruning are applied to filter unimportant prompts. 3) Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that E2VPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods like VPT, achieving higher accuracy while using far fewer trainable parameters (e.g. only 0.32% on VTAB-1k). The approach is shown to generalize across models, tasks, and pretraining objectives. Overall, E2VPT presents an effective and highly parameter-efficient way to adapt pretrained vision transformers to new tasks through prompt tuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel visual prompt tuning approach called E$^2$VPT (Effective and Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning) for adapting large-scale transformer models to new vision tasks. As model size continues to increase, fine-tuning becomes more parameter-intensive. To address this, the authors design an approach with two main components: (1) Effective prompting, which introduces visual prompts to the input sequence and key-value prompts to the self-attention module of each transformer layer. This leverages the architecture design and improves model performance. (2) Efficient prompting, which prunes redundant or harmful prompts using a two-level cascade strategy of token-wise and segment-wise pruning. This retains only the most influential prompts and significantly enhances parameter efficiency. 

Empirically, E$^2$VPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on image classification benchmarks using ViT and Swin backbones. It improves average accuracy on VTAB-1k by 5.85% over full fine-tuning and 1.99% over prior visual prompt tuning VPT, while using far fewer parameters (0.32% on average). The authors further visualize the learned embeddings, demonstrating E$^2$VPT's ability to generate separable representations. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into parameter-efficient tuning of large vision models under the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm. It highlights the importance of incorporating architectural awareness and pruning techniques into prompt design.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method presented in this paper is a novel prompt tuning framework for transformer-based vision models called E2VPT (Effective and Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning). The key ideas are:

- In addition to using visual prompts (learnable vectors prepended to the input sequence), they also introduce key-value prompts that are concatenated to the key and value matrices in the transformer self-attention layers. This allows the model to better adapt to new data distributions during fine-tuning. 

- They employ a pruning technique based on the lottery ticket hypothesis to remove redundant or unimportant prompts, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining performance. Specifically, they use token-wise pruning to eliminate low importance prompt tokens, and segment-wise pruning to further prune unimportant segments within each remaining token. 

- The pruned prompts are then retrained in a rewinding stage to recover performance. This two-level cascade pruning and rewinding approach allows them to greatly reduce the number of trainable parameters while preserving accuracy.

Overall, by carefully designing visual and key-value prompts tailored to transformer architectures and applying prompt pruning, their E2VPT framework achieves superior fine-tuning performance and efficiency compared to prior arts. The key novelty is the architecture-aware prompt design and pruning strategy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the following key problems/questions:

1. How to effectively adapt large-scale pretrained vision models (e.g. ViT, Swin) to new tasks with limited data, while being computationally efficient? 

2. Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like partial tuning, extra modules, prompt tuning have limitations in either performance gap compared to full fine-tuning or parameter efficiency. How can we improve upon these methods?

5. How do the learned representations differ between the proposed approach and previous prompt tuning methods? Can we gain more insights through visualization?

To summarize, this paper aims to develop an effective and efficient visual prompt tuning approach for adapting large vision transformers to new tasks. It proposes to inject prompts into both the input and the transformer backbone, and further prunes redundant prompts for higher parameter efficiency.
