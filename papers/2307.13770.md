# [E^2VPT: An Effective and Efficient Approach for Visual Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13770)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the key points of this paper appear to be:

1. The paper focuses on parameter-efficient learning for large-scale vision models, particularly transformer-based architectures. As these models grow in size, fine-tuning them for new tasks becomes increasingly parameter-intensive.

2. The paper proposes a new approach called E2VPT (Effective and Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning) to address this challenge. 

3. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to achieve superior performance while using fewer parameters during fine-tuning. This is in contrast to prior work that has focused only on reducing parameters in a heuristic manner without considering model architecture.

4. E2VPT introduces learnable prompts into both the input and backbone (self-attention layers) of transformers. This is claimed to improve effectiveness by leveraging the architecture.

5. E2VPT also employs prompt pruning to remove unnecessary prompts, improving efficiency. This explores the extremes of parameter usage during fine-tuning.

6. Empirical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of E2VPT, showing accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods while using far fewer parameters on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that architectural awareness and pruning can push prompt tuning to new frontiers of performance vs efficiency for fine-tuning large vision transformers. The paper aims to demonstrate this via the proposed E2VPT approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a mixed-prompt tuning approach for effective and efficient adaptation of large-scale transformer models for computer vision tasks. 

2. Introducing learnable key-value prompts into the self-attention layers of transformers, in addition to input visual prompts, to improve model adaptation. This allows capturing better interactions and patterns from the new data.

3. Designing a prompt pruning strategy with token-wise and segment-wise pruning to remove redundant prompts and improve parameter efficiency, while maintaining model performance. 

4. Demonstrating strong performance of the proposed approach over full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on image classification benchmarks, while using significantly fewer parameters (e.g. only 0.32% of model parameters on average).

5. Providing visualization and analysis to explain the effectiveness of the approach in learning better representations and separability for new tasks. 

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing an effective yet highly parameter-efficient prompt tuning approach for visual transformers, which carefully considers the architecture via prompts in self-attention and pruning for improved efficiency. The results demonstrate strong adaption performance at a fraction of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning.
