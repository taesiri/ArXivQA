# [Text-to-Image Diffusion Models can be Easily Backdoored through   Multimodal Data Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04175)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How vulnerable are large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to backdoor attacks through multimodal data poisoning?The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1) Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be effectively backdoored by injecting triggers into the text input and manipulating the image output during training. 2) The backdoors can target different semantic levels - pixel level, object level, and style level - to force the model to generate specific manipulated images when triggered.3) The backdoors can be injected efficiently through fine-tuning while maintaining model utility on clean inputs.4) The backdoors persist even after further fine-tuning if the triggers remain present in the text. The authors systematically investigate these hypotheses through proposed methods of multimodal backdoor attacks on different semantic levels, and evaluations of attack success rate, fidelity, and persistence. The central goal is to demonstrate the vulnerability of large diffusion models to such attacks when training data can be manipulated.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It performs a systematic investigation of backdoor attacks against text-to-image diffusion models through multimodal data poisoning. - It proposes a general multimodal backdoor attack framework called BadCond that consists of three types of attacks to tamper with the generated images at different semantic levels - pixel level, object level, and style level.- It demonstrates that large-scale text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be easily injected with backdoors using textual triggers with just a few thousand fine-tuning steps and minimal impact on model utility.- It analyzes the effectiveness of diverse textual triggers for backdoor attacks and examines the persistence of backdoors during further fine-tuning, providing insights for developing backdoor detection and defense methods.In summary, this paper performs the first comprehensive study of backdoor attacks against conditional text-to-image diffusion models, proposes an effective backdoor injection method, and reveals the vulnerability of these models to such attacks even with simple triggers and lightweight fine-tuning. The analyses on attack effectiveness and backdoor persistence also inform future work on securing these models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a general framework called BadCond for injecting multimodal backdoors into text-to-image diffusion models through data poisoning, enabling an attacker to manipulate the generated images in various semantic levels using textual triggers while preserving model utility on benign inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in backdoor attacks on generative models:- This paper focuses specifically on backdoor attacks against text-to-image diffusion models, which have not been extensively studied before. Prior work has looked at backdoor attacks on unconditional image diffusion models or other types of generative models like GANs. - The paper proposes a general framework called BadCond with three different backdoor attack methods targeting different levels of semantics (pixel, object, and style). Most prior work focused on just one type of backdoor attack at a time.- The attacks are multimodal, utilizing both textual triggers and manipulated training data. Some previous attacks on generative models relied only on data poisoning. Using textual triggers makes the attacks more stealthy.- The attacks are shown to be effective while preserving model utility on clean inputs. The paper introduces regularization and teacher losses to help maintain model performance. Other papers did not always rigorously evaluate impact on model utility.- The attacks are lightweight, requiring only 2K-8K training steps. Other generative model attack papers often retrained models from scratch which is more expensive.- The paper provides an in-depth analysis of factors like textual triggers, training steps, and backdoor persistence during fine-tuning. This provides useful insights for developing potential defenses.Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive framework and analysis of backdoor attacks on an important emerging class of models, text-to-image diffusion models. The attacks are demonstrated to be practical while preserving utility and insights are provided that advance the understanding of this threat model.
