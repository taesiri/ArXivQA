# [A Comparative Study of AI-Generated (GPT-4) and Human-crafted MCQs in   Programming Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing high-quality multiple choice questions (MCQs) for programming classes is challenging and time-consuming for educators. 
- There is a need for automated tools that can generate effective MCQs aligned with learning objectives.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors developed a GPT-4 based system to automatically generate MCQs from course-level context and module-level learning objectives (LOs).
- The system incorporates best practices for MCQ design and Bloom's taxonomy mapping to generate questions targeting specific cognitive skills.  
- It outputs MCQs with stem, key, distractors in a predefined format.

Experiments & Results:
- Evaluated quality and LO-alignment of 651 auto-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs for Python programming courses.
- Found 81.7% auto-generated MCQs passed all quality checks, comparable to human-authored ones.
- Key issues were presence of multiple correct answers (4.9% generated vs 1.1% human) and distractors giving away answers (4% vs 0.9%).
- Auto-generated MCQs exhibited significantly better alignment with target LOs than human-created ones.

Contributions:
- One of the first rigorous evaluations of LLM-powered automated MCQ generation for programming courses.
- Novel approach to leverage LOs, not just text passages, to generate aligned MCQs. 
- Extensive analysis - over 1,100 MCQ evaluations regarding quality and LO-alignment.

Overall, the paper demonstrates feasibility of high-quality MCQ generation using LLMs to significantly aid programming instructors.
