# [Learning from Visual Observation via Offline Pretrained State-to-Go
  Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we enable reinforcement learning agents to effectively learn policies directly from visual observations of expert demonstrations, without access to actions or rewards?

The key hypothesis is that: By pretraining a model offline on expert visual observations to predict state transitions and provide intrinsic rewards, an agent can efficiently learn a policy online solely guided by these intrinsic rewards, achieving comparable performance to learning from environmental rewards.

In particular, the paper proposes a two-stage learning framework:

1) In the first offline stage, a State-to-Go (STG) Transformer is pretrained in an adversarial manner to predict latent state transitions on expert visual observations. Concurrently, a discriminator is trained to distinguish expert vs predicted transitions. 

2) In the second online RL stage, the pretrained model provides intrinsic rewards based on the discriminator's assessments to guide policy learning, without any environmental rewards.

The central hypothesis is that the offline pretrained model can sufficiently capture important transition patterns and visual cues from the expert demonstrations, such that the derived intrinsic rewards alone are adequate signals for training the agent's policy to imitate the expert behavior.

By evaluating this framework on Atari and Minecraft games, the paper aims to demonstrate that pretraining on static visual observations can enable effective online policy learning, reducing the need for full interaction data containing states, actions and rewards.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel two-stage framework for learning from visual observation (LfVO). 

The key ideas are:

1. In the first stage, the paper introduces a new model called State-to-Go (STG) Transformer, which is pretrained offline to predict state transitions in an adversarial manner. This allows capturing useful transitional patterns from expert demonstrations without online environment interactions.  

2. In the second stage, the pretrained STG Transformer provides intrinsic rewards to guide an agent's online reinforcement learning, where the agent learns merely from intrinsic rewards without environmental rewards.

3. The paper demonstrates through experiments on Atari and Minecraft games that the proposed approach substantially outperforms existing methods for LfVO. It shows the potential of leveraging offline video-only data to solve challenging visual RL tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an effective two-stage framework that utilizes offline pretrained state transition prediction to enable learning complex policies directly from visual observations. This provides a new way to tackle difficult LfVO problems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework for learning from visual observation that involves pretraining a State-to-Go Transformer offline to predict state transitions and provide intrinsic rewards, followed by online reinforcement learning guided solely by the intrinsic rewards without environmental rewards.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in learning from visual observation:

- The paper proposes a two-stage framework involving offline pretraining and online RL. This differs from many prior LfVO methods like GAIfO, VGAIfO, and ELE that perform online learning. The offline pretraining provides a more sample-efficient way to leverage demonstration data.

- The paper introduces a new model called State-to-Go (STG) Transformer for offline transition prediction. This is a novel approach compared to prior representation learning methods like TCN, TDC, and ELE that mainly focused on learning temporally aligned embeddings. STG shows strong results on complex Atari and Minecraft games.

- The paper does not require any additional information like actions or goals during pretraining, unlike some prior works. This makes the approach very general and applicable to settings where only raw visual observations are available.

- For online learning, the paper uses the offline pretrained model to provide intrinsic rewards, avoiding the need for online adversarial training like in GAIfO. This results in better stability and efficiency.

- The paper demonstrates strong performance on rich 3D environments like Minecraft, while many prior LfVO works focused on simpler 2D or robotic control environments. This expands the applicability of LfVO to more complex visual domains.

Overall, the two-stage approach with offline STG Transformer pretraining provides a general, stable, and sample-efficient framework for tackling challenging LfVO problems, advancing the state-of-the-art in this field. The results on complex games like Minecraft also open up new possibilities for applying LfVO to real-world visual domains.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling the model and training datasets to larger sizes. The authors suggest that using larger observation/video datasets and scaling the model accordingly may lead to improved performance, as issues like domain gap and temporal alignment become less significant. 

- Integrating the proposed STG Transformer with model-based methods and planning approaches. The authors suggest the STG Transformer could be combined with model-based RL or planning methods to find better ways to leverage observational data beyond just the discriminative intrinsic rewards.

- Developing a more generalizable vision foundation model. The authors suggest combining their STG model with a robust large-scale vision foundation model like CLIP to improve generalization across more diverse tasks.

- Extending to hierarchical frameworks. The authors propose using their STG model in a hierarchical RL setting, where one-step predictions provide intrinsic rewards for low-level policies and multi-step predictions guide high-level policies. This may improve performance on long-horizon tasks.

- Applying the approach to other domains like robotics and autonomous driving where action labels are difficult to acquire. The authors suggest their observational learning approach could be useful in such domains where plenty of demonstration videos exist but labeling actions is impractical or dangerous.

In summary, the main future directions are around scaling up the model/data, integrating with model-based RL and planning, improving generalization, applying hierarchical frameworks, and testing the approach in other important domains like robotics. The key goal is to further improve the capabilities of learning high-quality policies from visual observation data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework for learning from visual observation (LfVO) to enable reinforcement learning agents to learn effectively from video demonstrations. In the first stage, they introduce and pretrain the State-to-Go (STG) Transformer to predict state transitions in an adversarial manner. This is done offline using only the visual observations from the demonstrations. Concurrently, temporally-aligned visual representations are learned. Together, a discriminator is trained to differentiate expert transitions, generating intrinsic rewards to guide downstream online RL training in the second stage. In the second stage, agents learn merely from the intrinsic rewards without any environmental rewards. Through experiments on Atari and Minecraft, the proposed method is shown to substantially outperform prior methods that learn representations or discriminators in an online manner during RL. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing offline video-only data to solve challenging visual RL tasks rather than relying on complete offline datasets with states, actions and rewards.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework for learning from visual observation (LfVO) to enable agents to learn policies from video demonstrations without access to environmental rewards. In the first stage, they introduce State-to-Go (STG) Transformer, a variant of Decision Transformer, which is pretrained offline to predict state transitions in an adversarial manner. Specifically, the STG Transformer predicts next state embeddings in a latent space. Concurrently, a discriminator is trained to distinguish between expert state transitions and predicted transitions, providing an assessment of transition quality. In addition, a temporal distance regressor is jointly trained to learn temporally aligned state representations. 

In the second stage, the pretrained components are used to guide online reinforcement learning without access to environmental rewards. The state representations and predicted transitions generated by the STG Transformer are fed to the discriminator to produce intrinsic rewards for the agent. Experiments are conducted in Atari games and Minecraft tasks. Results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves sample efficiency and overall performance compared to adversarial and representation learning baselines. The paper highlights the potential of utilizing offline video demonstrations for challenging visual reinforcement learning problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a two-stage framework for learning from visual observation (LfVO). 

In the first stage, they introduce and pretrain a State-to-Go (STG) Transformer offline to predict latent state transitions from expert demonstrations. The STG Transformer is trained adversarially along with a discriminator to distinguish expert and predicted transitions. Meanwhile, they concurrently learn temporally-aligned visual representations via a self-supervised temporal distance regression module.

In the second stage, the pretrained components are utilized to provide intrinsic rewards to guide reinforcement learning without environmental rewards. Specifically, the difference between the discriminator's scores for the predicted transition and real transition is used as the intrinsic reward. This encourages the agent to follow expert-like transitions predicted by the STG Transformer.

The proposed method is evaluated on Atari games and Minecraft tasks. Results demonstrate superior performance over baseline approaches, highlighting the potential of leveraging offline video-only demonstrations for difficult reinforcement learning problems. The key novelty lies in the offline adversarial pretraining of the STG Transformer to effectively capture transition patterns from observations and provide informative intrinsic rewards for online policy learning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper proposes a new method for learning from visual observation (LfVO) to enable reinforcement learning agents to learn effectively from video demonstrations without access to environmental rewards or expert actions. 

The key problem it aims to address is the limitations of prior LfVO methods:

- Representation learning methods tend to only work well in continuous control tasks, not as effective in complex video games. 

- Adversarial/GAN methods require online training of a discriminator which is sample inefficient. They can also be sensitive to noise in visual inputs.

- Goal-oriented methods need predefined goals which may not be feasible for open-ended tasks. They can also get misled by lack of continuity in observations.

To overcome these issues, the paper introduces a two-stage framework:

1) In the first offline stage, they pretrain a State-to-Go (STG) Transformer to predict state transitions in an adversarial way. This is more sample efficient than online adversarial training. They also use a temporal distance regressor (TDR) to learn temporally aligned representations. 

2) In the second online RL stage, the pretrained components provide intrinsic rewards to guide the agent, without needing environmental rewards. The STG Transformer intrinsic rewards based on expert state transition prediction are more robust and informative than just using a notion of "progress".

So in summary, the key contribution is a novel two-stage approach to LfVO that utilizes offline pretrained models to provide more effective intrinsic rewards for guiding online reinforcement learning from only visual observations. This helps address limitations of prior LfVO methods.
