# [SeeABLE: Soft Discrepancies and Bounded Contrastive Learning for   Exposing Deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11296)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we design an effective deepfake detector that generalizes well to unseen deepfake generation techniques?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Formulating deepfake detection as a one-class out-of-distribution detection task and training only on real faces will lead to better generalization compared to binary classification models trained to discriminate between real and (pseudo) fake faces.2) Localizing subtle artificially-generated image perturbations and regressing them to predefined prototypes will allow the model to learn semantically meaningful and robust features for detection. 3) Combining soft spatial and frequency domain discrepancies along with auxiliary geometric guidance will further enhance the model's capabilities.The authors propose a new deepfake detection model called SeeABLE that incorporates these ideas. The main goals are to improve generalization across different datasets and unseen manipulation techniques compared to prior art.In summary, the central research focus is on designing a deepfake detector with strong generalization abilities by treating it as an anomaly detection task and using ideas like soft discrepancies and bounded contrastive learning. The key hypotheses relate to the benefits of the proposed techniques.
