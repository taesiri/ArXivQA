# [Node Proximity Is All You Need: Unified Structural and Positional Node   and Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How can we develop a unified framework that generates both proximity-preserving (positional) and structural node embeddings from node proximity matrices?The key hypothesis is that the same proximity-based framework can produce both types of node embeddings by using different choices for the embedding function. Specifically:- Using SVD as the embedding function will produce proximity-preserving (positional) node embeddings. - Using a permutation-invariant function like characteristic function sampling (CFS) as the embedding function will produce structural node embeddings.The proposed framework called PhUSION aims to show the similarities and differences between proximity-preserving and structural node embeddings. It also seeks to encompass and improve upon existing node embedding techniques through exploring different design choices for computing node proximities, applying nonlinear transformations, and generating embeddings.In summary, this paper hypothesizes that a unified proximity-based framework can generate both positional and structural node embeddings by varying the embedding function, and seeks to understand the relationships and best practices for both types of node embeddings.
