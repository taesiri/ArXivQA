# [Node Proximity Is All You Need: Unified Structural and Positional Node   and Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How can we develop a unified framework that generates both proximity-preserving (positional) and structural node embeddings from node proximity matrices?The key hypothesis is that the same proximity-based framework can produce both types of node embeddings by using different choices for the embedding function. Specifically:- Using SVD as the embedding function will produce proximity-preserving (positional) node embeddings. - Using a permutation-invariant function like characteristic function sampling (CFS) as the embedding function will produce structural node embeddings.The proposed framework called PhUSION aims to show the similarities and differences between proximity-preserving and structural node embeddings. It also seeks to encompass and improve upon existing node embedding techniques through exploring different design choices for computing node proximities, applying nonlinear transformations, and generating embeddings.In summary, this paper hypothesizes that a unified proximity-based framework can generate both positional and structural node embeddings by varying the embedding function, and seeks to understand the relationships and best practices for both types of node embeddings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing PhUSION, a unified framework for computing structural and positional node embeddings as well as graph embeddings. The key ideas are:- PhUSION has 3 steps - computing node proximities, applying nonlinear filtering, and dimensionality reduction for embedding. By choosing different options for these steps, PhUSION can generate both structural and positional node embeddings. - The authors show that the choice of embedding function (SVD vs characteristic function sampling) is what determines whether the embeddings are positional or structural. The other steps can be shared.- PhUSION generalizes and provides novel combinations of existing node embedding techniques like GraphWave, NetMF, and HOPE.- When node embeddings are aggregated, PhUSION can also derive graph embeddings. It is shown to capture more expressive features compared to prior graph feature learning methods.- The authors perform an extensive empirical study with over 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 35 methods to evaluate design choices for node and graph embeddings. This provides insights into what works well and why.In summary, the main contribution is providing a unified perspective to clarify the relationship between positional and structural node embeddings, generalizing existing techniques, and systematically investigating successful design choices through extensive experiments. The proposed PhUSION framework is shown to be effective for node, as well as whole graph, feature learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a unified framework called PhUSION for generating node and graph embeddings that can capture both structural role similarities and positional proximities, and shows how it generalizes and improves upon existing embedding methods through an empirical study.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a unified framework for learning both structural and positional node embeddings, called PhUSION. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:- It provides a unifying perspective on structural vs positional embeddings, which have often been treated as distinct methodologies. The paper clarifies the technical similarities and differences between the two types of embeddings. This contrasts with some previous work claiming they are fundamentally different (Rossi et al. 2020), while aligning with recent theory equating them (Jin et al. 2020).- It systematically evaluates design choices for computing node proximity, applying nonlinearities, and generating embeddings. This large empirical study uncovers successful combinations of choices for both types of embeddings. It builds on NetMF's framework for proximity embeddings and extends it to also encompass structural embeddings.- It shows how node embeddings can be aggregated into expressive whole-graph features. The paper interprets prior graph feature learning methods as special cases and shows the greater modeling capacity of embeddings aggregated from PhUSION. - It provides new insights into effective choices for proximity matrices, nonlinearities, and embeddings. For example, it finds that nonlinearity helps proximity embeddings more than structural ones, and characterizes differences in desirable proximity matrix properties.Overall, this paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to unifying and advancing node and graph embedding methodology. The systematic design space exploration and proposed interpretations stand out compared to prior work. The unified perspective and new insights on embedding techniques differentiate this research from existing node and graph embedding papers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests several promising future research directions:1. Further characterization of design choices for $\proximity{}$ and $\nonlinearity{}$: The paper shows that certain choices tend to work better for positional vs. structural embeddings, but an intrinsic characterization of what makes a good choice is still lacking. Further analysis of properties of the resulting proximity matrices could lead to better model selection.2. Exploring additional options within the PhUSION framework: The paper empirically evaluates 35 design combinations, but there is room to explore others as well. In particular, different embedding functions like nonlinear autoencoders or trainable characteristic function sampling could be incorporated. 3. Scalability: The paper notes that fast approximate methods for computing the node proximity matrices could allow the framework to scale to very large graphs. This is an important direction to make the methods practical.4. Alternate graph feature aggregation: For graph classification, the paper uses simple mean pooling to aggregate node embeddings. More complex aggregation schemes could potentially capture higher-order dependencies between nodes.5. Incorporating node attributes: For graph classification tasks, attributes could be included by taking the Kronecker product with structural embeddings, as done in some prior works.6. Theoretical analysis: While the paper provides an empirical evaluation, theoretical analysis of why certain design choices are effective could lead to new insights.In summary, the main future directions are: further study of design choices, scalability, more complex embedding and aggregation schemes, inclusion of attributes, and theoretical analysis. Advances in these areas could build on the unifying perspective provided by PhUSION to develop better node and graph feature learning techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents PhUSION, a unified framework for learning both structural and positional node embeddings from node proximity matrices. The framework has three main steps: (1) compute pairwise node proximities using functions like personalized PageRank or heat kernels, (2) apply nonlinear transformations like thresholding or logarithms, and (3) generate embeddings with dimensionality reduction like SVD or characteristic function sampling. PhUSION generalizes several existing node embedding methods. The key difference between structural and positional embeddings is shown to be the choice of embedding function: SVD produces positional embeddings while permutation-invariant functions like sampling produce structural embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that PhUSION can improve over existing proximity-based and structural embeddings. The node embeddings can also be aggregated into graph embeddings, outperforming prior graph feature learning and kernel methods. Overall, PhUSION provides a unifying perspective and extensive empirical analysis on learning node and graph embeddings from proximity matrices. The insights can guide the design of future node and graph representation learning methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a unified framework called PhUSION for learning both structural and positional node embeddings from node proximity matrices. The framework has three main steps: 1) compute a matrix of node proximities, 2) apply a nonlinear transformation, and 3) generate embeddings using a dimensionality reduction method like SVD or characteristic function sampling.

The same node proximity matrix and nonlinear transformation can be used for both types of embedding. The authors demonstrate how existing node embedding methods like NetMF, HOPE, and GraphWave are special cases of the PhUSION framework. They perform extensive experiments with 35 combinations of design choices and find that different choices work best for positional vs. structural embeddings. The framework is extended to learn graph embeddings by aggregating node embeddings. PhUSION graph embeddings outperform previous methods like NetLSD and RetGK that use simpler representations.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes PhUSION, a unified framework for generating node embeddings that can model either structural role similarity or positional proximity between nodes in a network. The key idea is that both kinds of embeddings can be derived from a matrix of pairwise node proximity scores. The method has three main steps: 1) Compute a matrix of node proximity scores using methods like personalized PageRank, heat kernel, etc; 2) Apply nonlinear transformations like thresholding or logarithm to the proximity scores; 3) Generate low-dimensional node embeddings from the transformed proximity matrix using dimensionality reduction techniques like SVD (for positional embeddings) or characteristic function sampling (CFS, for structural embeddings). By choosing different options in each step, PhUSION can reproduce existing proximity-based or structural embedding methods like NetMF and GraphWave. It also allows novel combinations to create new embedding techniques. The node embeddings can then be aggregated into graph-level features for tasks like graph classification.
