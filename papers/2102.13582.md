# [Node Proximity Is All You Need: Unified Structural and Positional Node   and Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How can we develop a unified framework that generates both proximity-preserving (positional) and structural node embeddings from node proximity matrices?The key hypothesis is that the same proximity-based framework can produce both types of node embeddings by using different choices for the embedding function. Specifically:- Using SVD as the embedding function will produce proximity-preserving (positional) node embeddings. - Using a permutation-invariant function like characteristic function sampling (CFS) as the embedding function will produce structural node embeddings.The proposed framework called PhUSION aims to show the similarities and differences between proximity-preserving and structural node embeddings. It also seeks to encompass and improve upon existing node embedding techniques through exploring different design choices for computing node proximities, applying nonlinear transformations, and generating embeddings.In summary, this paper hypothesizes that a unified proximity-based framework can generate both positional and structural node embeddings by varying the embedding function, and seeks to understand the relationships and best practices for both types of node embeddings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing PhUSION, a unified framework for computing structural and positional node embeddings as well as graph embeddings. The key ideas are:- PhUSION has 3 steps - computing node proximities, applying nonlinear filtering, and dimensionality reduction for embedding. By choosing different options for these steps, PhUSION can generate both structural and positional node embeddings. - The authors show that the choice of embedding function (SVD vs characteristic function sampling) is what determines whether the embeddings are positional or structural. The other steps can be shared.- PhUSION generalizes and provides novel combinations of existing node embedding techniques like GraphWave, NetMF, and HOPE.- When node embeddings are aggregated, PhUSION can also derive graph embeddings. It is shown to capture more expressive features compared to prior graph feature learning methods.- The authors perform an extensive empirical study with over 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 35 methods to evaluate design choices for node and graph embeddings. This provides insights into what works well and why.In summary, the main contribution is providing a unified perspective to clarify the relationship between positional and structural node embeddings, generalizing existing techniques, and systematically investigating successful design choices through extensive experiments. The proposed PhUSION framework is shown to be effective for node, as well as whole graph, feature learning.
