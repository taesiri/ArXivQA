# [Distilling LLMs' Decomposition Abilities into Compact Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities but their large size makes them computationally expensive and difficult to customize. In contrast, smaller models are more accessible but lack complex reasoning skills.

- There is limited work exploring the specific reasoning skill of breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. Existing works focus more on end-to-end reasoning solutions.

- There is a need for specialized datasets and benchmarks to advance research into the sub-questioning process within mathematical reasoning tasks.

Proposed Solution  
- The paper introduces a novel AI-generated dataset called GSM8K-AI-SubQ based on the GSM8K math word problem dataset. 

- The dataset contains sub-questions for each GSM8K problem generated by ChatGPT, along with ChatGPT's answers to those sub-questions and usefulness feedback on the sub-questions.

- The paper establishes baseline results on the new dataset using smaller pretrained language models like GPT-2, trained using behavioral cloning, filtered behavioral cloning, and offline reinforcement learning (ILQL algorithm).

Key Contributions
- Creation of a specialized AI-generated benchmark dataset tailored to evaluating sub-question decomposition abilities for mathematical reasoning.  

- Establishing baseline results on the dataset using diverse techniques like behavioral cloning, filtered BC, and offline RL.

- Underscoring the significant gap between ChatGPT's performance and current capabilities of smaller models, motivating further research into improving reasoning and utilization of offline RL in NLP.

The paper discusses limitations and outlines several promising directions for future work, including advances in offline RL for NLP, creation of larger benchmarks, and better understanding of the sub-question answering process.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces an AI-generated benchmark dataset for evaluating sub-questioning abilities in reasoning tasks. What are some of the key benefits and potential limitations of using AI-generated data compared to human-annotated data?

2. The paper employs offline reinforcement learning techniques like Implicit Language Q-Learning (ILQL) to distill reasoning abilities into smaller models. How suitable is offline RL for language tasks compared to online RL or supervised learning approaches? What modifications can make it more suitable?

3. The performance gap between ChatGPT and the best compact model is quite significant. What are some potential ways to narrow this gap in future work through model architecture changes, different training techniques, or leveraging additional data?

4. Could the sub-question answering component be improved by fine-tuning the answering model specifically for that task rather than just using a general pretrained LM? What benefits might specialized tuning provide?

5. How reliably does the AI-generated feedback correlate with question quality and final answer correctness? Could the reliability be further improved by soliciting multiple instances of feedback?

6. For real-world application, what tradeoffs exist between deployment of very large models with reasoning abilities versus distilled compact models? When might one approach be preferred over the other?

7. The paper focuses specifically on mathematical reasoning tasks. How well might the overall approach transfer to other complex reasoning domains like commonsense reasoning? Would domain adaption be challenging?

8. What implications does this work have for how humans can effectively teach AI systems to improve their reasoning in a scalable way? Does it provide any insights?

9. The code and dataset are publicly available. What interesting research directions could others explore by building on this work? What components are available for easy extension?

10. The authors acknowledge computational resource constraints that limited experiments such as use of larger GPT-2 model sizes. As more resources become available, how might performance scale with ability to leverage much larger foundation models?
