# [Intrinsic Subgraph Generation for Interpretable Graph based Visual   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual question answering (VQA) models using deep learning have become very accurate but act as black boxes, lacking interpretability. 
- Most work on explainable AI generates explanations post-hoc rather than taking an intrinsic approach where the model itself produces explanations.
- There is a need for interpretable VQA models that provide explanations intrinsically alongside predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a graph-based VQA system that uses a graph neural network (GNN) with a graph attention network (GAT) component at its core.
- The key idea is for the model to intrinsically generate a relevant subgraph from the input scene graph while answering questions. This subgraph highlights the most salient nodes and acts as an explanation.
- A discrete hard attention mask is incorporated into the GAT using implicit maximum likelihood estimation to extract the subgraph. This makes the sampling of nodes for the subgraph differentiable.

Main Contributions:
- Competitive VQA performance is achieved even when using only a subset of nodes from the input scene graph.
- Human evaluators strongly preferred the intrinsically generated subgraph explanations over explanations from post-hoc methods like GNNExplainer.
- Quantitative metrics are introduced to evaluate explanation quality when no ground truth is available, including answer/question token coverage and performance drop when removing subgraphs. These metrics align with human judgments.

In summary, the paper presents an interpretable graph-based VQA method that generates intrinsic subgraph explanations alongside predictions. Both human and automated evaluations show the high quality of the explanations compared to post-hoc approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an interpretable approach for graph-based visual question answering that intrinsically generates a subgraph explanation alongside the answer prediction, and shows through human evaluation and quantitative metrics that these explanations are preferred over common post-hoc explainability methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel VQA system that not only provides answers but also offers relevant explanations. The approach delivers highly accurate results, and human evaluators showed a preference for the intrinsic explanations over traditional post-hoc explainability methods.

2. Introducing quantitative metrics, which correlate with the results of the human evaluation, to measure the quality of explanations. These metrics can be used to assess explanations in cases where no ground-truth references are available.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) a new interpretable VQA system that generates explanations, validated via human evaluation, and (2) quantitative metrics to measure explanation quality without ground-truth.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Interpretability
- Explainability
- XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)  
- Graph based VQA
- Subgraphs
- GNNs (Graph Neural Networks)
- I-MLE (Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation)

The paper proposes an interpretable approach for graph-based visual question answering (VQA) that intrinsically generates a subgraph as an explanation during answer prediction. It utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and a technique called implicit maximum likelihood estimation (I-MLE) to extract the most relevant subgraph. The goals are to increase interpretability in VQA through the use of GNNs and compare the quality of the generated explanations to standard post-hoc explainability methods in terms of explainable AI (XAI). So the key terms reflect this focus on interpretability, explainability, graph-based VQA, subgraph generation, GNNs, and the I-MLE method.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Masking Graph Attention Network (M-GAT) learn to intrinsically generate relevant subgraphs from the input graph that contain the most relevant nodes for answering the given question? What is the approach used to differentiate through the discrete sampling step?

2. What is the motivation behind using hard attention for generating subgraphs instead of soft attention? How does hard attention provide clearer and less ambiguous explanations compared to soft attention? 

3. The paper proposes using Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to estimate gradients for the discrete top-k sampling procedure. Why was this method chosen over other options like Gumbel-Softmax? What are the benefits it provides?

4. How exactly does the global question vector guide the global attention aggregation after the graph neural network processing? What role does it play in the final multilayer perceptron for answer prediction?

5. What modifications were made to the standard Graph Attention Network architecture to enable the hard attention masking? How is the update rule different and how does the hard attention mask computation work?

6. Why was the GQA dataset chosen for evaluation over other VQA datasets? What characteristics and properties of GQA make it suitable for evaluating graph-based VQA approaches focused on interpretability?

7. What were the key findings from the human evaluation study comparing explanations from the proposed approach and other methods? What can be inferred about human preferences regarding intrinsic vs post-hoc explanations?  

8. How well do the proposed quantitative metrics for evaluating explanation subgraphs, namely Answer Token Co-occurrence and Question Token Co-occurrence, correlate with human judgments? What do the correlation values indicate?

9. For the subgraph removal evaluation metric, why does lower accuracy indicate better performance of the explanation method? What does a high drop in accuracy after removing subgraphs signify?

10. What are some limitations of using structured scene graph representations compared to raw image inputs? In what ways could the simplification negatively impact real-world performance of the model?
