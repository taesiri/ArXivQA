# [Modelling Species Distributions with Deep Learning to Predict Plant   Extinction Risk and Assess Climate Change Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an urgent need to set ambitious extinction risk targets to guide conservation policy. Quantifying the acceleration of extinction risk due to climate change is critical.
- The IUCN Red List assesses extinction risk but assessments are lagging. Only 15% of known plant species have been assessed. 
- Existing automated IUCN status classification methods rely heavily on species' geographic distributions. This limits their ability to model future projections under climate change.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a novel method to extract species traits predictive of IUCN status, based on a deep learning species distribution model (SDM). 
- The SDM-based features capture information about species' environmental niches and preferences.
- These flexible features allow testing of climate change impacts on IUCN status distributions under different dispersal and climate scenarios.

Key Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance for IUCN status classification while using flexible SDM-based features.
- Allows analysis of climate change impacts on extinction risk distributions - by continent, latitude and altitude.
- Predicts increase in proportion of threatened orchid species globally by 2100, with critical rates in Africa, Asia, South America, tropics and low altitudes. 
- Identifies continents, altitudes and latitudes likely to see high concentrations of threatened species.
- Provides list of species predicted to go extinct under climate change.

The main strengths are the flexibility of the SDM-based features for analysing climate projections, benchmark performance for status classification, and novel biodiversity trend analyses to inform conservation policy targets. Limitations include relying on simplified dispersal scenarios and equilibrium assumptions. Overall, the proposed solution and analyses make valuable contributions towards setting and evaluating ambitious extinction risk reduction targets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel method to predict species extinction risk that achieves state-of-the-art performance while allowing the flexibility to model climate change impacts, revealing global increases and specific geographical patterns in the proportion of threatened orchid species over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

"A novel method for extracting species traits predictive of IUCN extinction risk status, which allows modelling and testing the impact of bioclimatic projections. Based on a deep species distribution model, it achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while allowing to explore climate change scenarios and test how status distributions might evolve."

In other words, the main contribution is a new method to predict species' extinction risk based on features learned by a deep neural network species distribution model. This allows testing the impact of climate change projections on extinction risk, while matching the state-of-the-art performance in predicting IUCN status categories. The flexibility to explore different climate scenarios is a key novelty compared to previous approaches.

- Altitudinal trends

The paper focuses on using deep learning-based species distribution modeling to extract features predictive of extinction risk, allowing the exploration of climate change scenarios. Key aspects include training a deep convolutional neural network on orchid occurrence data, using it to encode input data into a reduced feature space, aggregating features to the species level, and using them to train a random forest classifier to predict IUCN extinction risk categories. This then allows analyzing trends in threatened species distributions across continents, latitudes and altitudes under future climate projections and dispersal scenarios.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions extracting species traits predictive of IUCN extinction risk status as the main contribution. How exactly does the proposed method extract and summarize species traits from the deep species distribution model to predict extinction risk?

2. The paper uses a deep convolutional neural network (Inception v3) for modeling species distributions. What modifications were made to the original Inception v3 architecture to adapt it for this task? How was the model trained and evaluated?

3. Two extreme dispersal scenarios (no dispersal and unlimited dispersal) are used when projecting future species distributions. What are the assumptions behind each scenario and how do they affect the species niche features extracted in the next step?

4. The paper mentions using weighted mean, standard deviation and sum over the deep SDM feature vectors to aggregate information from the point level to the species level. What is the intuition behind using these specific statistical measures? 

5. What were the different classification algorithms explored for predicting IUCN status? Why was the random forest classifier selected as the best performer? How was it evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art?

6. The RCP 8.5 climate change scenario is used for making projections. What are some limitations of relying solely on climate change to predict future extinction risk? What other threat information could be incorporated?

7. The results show specific geographical and altitudinal patterns in threatened species distributions. What are some ecological hypotheses proposed in the paper that could explain these patterns?

8. How does considering only IUCN assessed species versus all species change some of the predicted geographic trends in threatened status proportions? What does this indicate about the method?

9. What are some limitations acknowledged with the proposed method? How could the thresholding, weighting scheme and status classification be improved in future work?

10. The paper mentions combining heterogeneous data sources as an advantage of deep learning methods. What are some other recent advances in deep learning that could benefit species distribution modeling and IUCN status prediction?
