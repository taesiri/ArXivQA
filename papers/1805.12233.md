# [How Important Is a Neuron?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12233)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we extend the notion of attribution (i.e. explaining a deep network's prediction in terms of input variables) to also understand the importance of hidden units within the network?

The key idea they introduce is the concept of "conductance", which aims to quantify the importance of a hidden neuron by calculating the "flow" of attribution through that neuron. So conductance allows attributing a network's predictions not just to the input variables, but also to the hidden units.

The paper evaluates conductance both theoretically (proving desirable properties) and empirically on image and text networks. The evaluations aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of conductance in identifying important insights into how these networks work internally.

In summary, the main research contribution is introducing conductance to extend attribution to hidden units, in order to better understand the internal workings and importance of different parts of deep networks. The paper aims to show this is an effective approach through theoretical analysis and empirical demonstrations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the notion of "conductance" to extend attribution methods to understand the importance of hidden units in deep neural networks. 

2. It proposes a specific definition of conductance based on Integrated Gradients attribution. The key idea is to decompose the computation of Integrated Gradients using the chain rule to attribute importance scores to hidden units.

3. It evaluates conductance against other methods like activations, gradient*activations, and internal influence on theoretical properties, ablation studies, and feature selection tasks. The evaluations are done on Inception Net for image classification and a sentiment analysis model.

4. It demonstrates the effectiveness of conductance in identifying insights into the internal workings of the two neural networks evaluated. For example, finding influential filters in Inception Net, observing redundancy in the sentiment model, and identifying filters capturing negation.

5. It discusses applications of conductance like improving model interpretability, aiding debugging, analyzing model architectures, and extracting rules from models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the notion of conductance to attribute importance to hidden units in neural networks, with empirical demonstrations of its effectiveness on real models. Theoretical analysis and comparisons to other methods are also provided.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points from the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of conductance to measure the importance of hidden neurons in deep networks, evaluates it theoretically and empirically on image and text models, and shows it can provide insights into how the networks function.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces the concept of "conductance" to measure the importance of hidden neurons in deep neural networks. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work:

- It builds on the idea of attribution methods like Integrated Gradients that attribute a model's predictions to its input features. Conductance extends this by propagating attributions through the network to measure importance of hidden units.

- Prior work has tried to understand hidden units via optimization approaches like activation maximization or feature visualization. However, those don't directly measure a unit's importance. This paper quantifies importance through conductance.

- It compares against using activations or gradients * activations as importance measures. The paper argues conductance is theoretically better motivated. It provides ablation studies showing conductance correlates better with model changes.

- A concurrent paper on "internal influence" has a similar goal of measuring neuron importance. This paper compares against that method, showing conductance satisfies desirable properties like "completeness" that internal influence lacks.

- For evaluations, this paper uses a combination of theoretical analysis, ablation studies, and feature selection experiments. The ablation studies are a fairly direct way to validate importance measures.

- It demonstrates the approach on both an image classification model (Inception-Net) and a text sentiment analysis model. Showing effectiveness on two different modalities strengthens the generality of the method.

In summary, this paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions over prior work to better measure the importance of hidden units. The ablation studies in particular help validate conductance over alternatives like activation or internal influence. The analysis also provides some interesting insights into the studied models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Studying conductance in other types of networks beyond image classification and sentiment analysis, such as sequence-to-sequence networks. The authors suggest that conductance could potentially help analyze the behavior of attention neurons in these models.

- Further evaluating the effectiveness of conductance, for example by using it as part of the training process to help identify areas of model saturation or redundancy. The authors suggest conductance could be useful for improving model architecture and training.

- Using conductance to help build more interpretable models, for instance by manually labeling important filters and providing natural language explanations of model behavior based on the influence of different filters. 

- Applying conductance analysis to additional datasets and models to gain more insights into model behavior, negations, redundancies, etc.

- Using conductance to help extract symbolic rules from neural networks, for example identifying phrases with high conductance for certain filters related to negation.

- Comparing conductance to other related attribution methods like DeepLIFT and Layerwise Relevance Propagation in terms of properties and empirical evaluations.

- Developing more formal axiomatic characterization of conductance to better understand its theoretical properties.

So in summary, the authors propose many different directions for extending the analysis of model internals via conductance, ranging from model debugging and improvement to interpretation and rule extraction. More empirical analysis is needed, as well as comparisons to other methods.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of conductance to extend attribution methods to understand the importance of hidden units in deep neural networks. Attribution methods attribute a network's prediction to its input features. Conductance adapts the method of Integrated Gradients to instead measure the flow of attribution through hidden neurons. Formally, the conductance of a hidden neuron is defined as the integrated gradients attribution flowing through that neuron from the inputs. 

The paper evaluates conductance against other methods like activation values and influence scores. It shows theoretically and empirically that conductance better captures the true importance of hidden units. Experiments on image classification and sentiment analysis models demonstrate how conductance can provide insights into the internal workings of networks. The method identifies influential hidden units, shows redundancy and division of labor between units, and finds units implementing higher level concepts like negation. Overall, conductance enables interpreting predictions in terms of higher level network components versus just input features.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of "conductance" to extend attribution methods to understand the importance of hidden units in neural networks. Conductance is based on Integrated Gradients, an attribution method that relies on integrating gradients along a path from a baseline input to the actual input. The key idea is to decompose the computation of Integrated Gradients using the chain rule to attribute importance to individual hidden units. Specifically, the conductance of a hidden unit is defined as the flow of Integrated Gradients' attribution through that unit. The total conductance of a unit sums the conductance across all input variables. Conductance allows explaining a prediction in terms of the hidden units, and evaluating their importances. The method is applied to an image classification model and a sentiment analysis model to demonstrate its effectiveness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep neural network to the hidden units within the network. 

Specifically, prior work has focused on attributing predictions to the input features of a network (e.g. pixels in an image). This paper introduces the notion of "conductance" to extend attribution to hidden units like neurons or filters.

The key questions addressed are:

- How can we quantify the importance or contribution of individual hidden units to a network's overall prediction?

- How does the proposed conductance method compare to other techniques for explaining hidden units like activation values or gradient*activation?

- What insights can conductance provide about real neural networks, like understanding how filters in a CNN collaborate or capture concepts?

So in summary, the main problem is extending attribution techniques to hidden units rather than just input features, in order to better understand how neural networks operate internally. The paper proposes conductance as a way to quantify the importance of hidden units to the prediction.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the notion of "conductance" to quantify the importance of hidden units in deep neural networks. The conductance of a hidden unit is defined based on integrated gradients, which involves accumulating the gradients with respect to an input example as it is interpolated between a baseline and the actual input. Specifically, the conductance of a hidden unit is the flow of integrated gradients attribution through that unit. Conductance satisfies several desirable theoretical properties like completeness and insensitivity. The authors evaluate conductance on two models - an image classification model using InceptionNet architecture and a sentiment analysis model using convolutional networks. For the image model, they show conductance identifies influential filters confirmed through ablation studies and feature selection experiments. For the sentiment model, conductance reveals insights like division of labor between filters and dedicated filters for negation. Overall, conductance enables understanding the internal workings and importance of hidden units in deep networks through theoretical properties and intuitive empirical results on real-world models. The key novelty is extending integrated gradients, normally used for input attribution, to hidden layers to quantify hidden unit importance.
