# [Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction with Domain-Adapted BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03194)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper performs BERT-based analysis on corporate disclosure data to predict impending bankruptcies. While prior literature focuses on developing prediction methodologies with financial variables, this paper instead focuses on improving the input data quality. Specifically, the authors employ a BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on MD&A disclosures, demonstrating that BERT outperforms dictionary-based and Word2Vec-based predictions under various classification models. To address the issue of domain shift between the original BERT model and corporate disclosures, the authors apply an unsupervised domain adaptation technique called self-learning with confidence-based filtering. This domain adaptation procedure brings significant improvement in prediction accuracy, achieving 91.56% accuracy with a linear SVM model. Overall, the contextualized sentiment analysis enabled by BERT provides more value-relevant information than non-context methods, and adapting BERT to the corporate disclosure domain further enhances bankruptcy prediction performance.
