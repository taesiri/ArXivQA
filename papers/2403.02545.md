# [Wukong: Towards a Scaling Law for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling laws play a key role in improving model quality for large language models, but such laws have not been established for recommendation models. Existing recommendation models face challenges in adapting to increasingly complex real-world datasets as they scale up.

- Simply expanding the sparse component (embedding tables) of models does not enhance their ability to capture complex feature interactions. It also leads to inefficient hardware usage.

- Existing interaction components like MLPs, Factorization Machines etc have limitations in capturing high-order interactions effectively. Prior arts also lack comprehensive processes for model scaling.

Proposed Solution - Wukong:
- Proposes a unified network architecture using stacked Factorization Machines to capture high-order feature interactions in an efficient, scalable way. 

- Uses principle of binary exponentiation - each FM layer handles 2nd order interactions of its inputs. Subsequent layer inputs are outputs of previous layers, allowing capture of exponentially higher order interactions.

- Additional components like Linear Compression Blocks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons handle residual connections, embed interaction results etc.

Contributions:
- Evaluation on 6 public datasets shows Wukong outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently in terms of AUC.

- Experiments on large-scale internal dataset with over 100x complexity increase shows Wukong significantly outperforms baselines while demonstrating a clear scaling law (0.4% quality improvement per 200x increase in complexity). 

- Matches accuracy of other models with 40x less compute resources, beneficial for resource-constrained scenarios.

- Provides first demonstration of scaling law in recommendation models, similar to large language models.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective recommendation model architecture and scaling mechanism to improve quality along with model/data scale and complexity.
