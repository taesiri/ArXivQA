# [Differentiable Neural Input Search for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04466)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to automatically search for optimal mixed embedding dimensions for different features in recommender systems, which is referred to as the neural input search (NIS) problem. The key hypothesis is that assigning features with different embedding dimensions according to their characteristics (e.g. frequency) can improve the performance and efficiency of recommender systems based on latent factor models.Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Differentiable Neural Input Search (DNIS) to address the NIS problem. The main idea is to optimize a soft selection layer that controls the significance of each embedding dimension through gradient descent on the validation loss. This allows searching for mixed feature dimensions in a continuous space rather than from a predefined discrete set.In summary, the paper focuses on researching an effective and efficient method for neural input search in recommender systems, with the central hypothesis that learning to assign mixed embedding dimensions can enhance recommendation performance and model efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a differentiable neural input search (DNIS) method to automatically search for mixed feature embedding dimensions in recommender systems. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes to relax the search space of mixed embedding dimensions to be continuous, so that the selection of dimensions can be optimized in a differentiable manner using gradient descent. This avoids the need to restrict dimensions to be chosen from a predefined discrete set.- Introduces a soft selection layer between the embedding layer and interaction layers to control the significance of each embedding dimension. The soft selection layer is optimized based on the model's validation performance.  - Develops a gradient normalization technique to deal with the high variance of gradients when optimizing the soft selection layer. This helps to stabilize the optimization process.- Designs a fine-grained pruning procedure through layer merging to derive a discrete mixed dimension scheme after training. This produces flexible embedding dimensions for different features. - The proposed DNIS method is model-agnostic and can be incorporated into various existing latent factor models to improve their recommendation performance and reduce embedding size.- Experiments on three real-world datasets for rating prediction, CTR prediction and top-k recommendation show DNIS achieves the best results compared to prior neural input search methods, with fewer parameters and lower time cost.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel differentiable optimization framework to automatically search over a continuous space of mixed embedding dimensions for recommender systems. This improves upon prior works that rely on restricted discrete search spaces. DNIS demonstrates superior efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on Differentiable Neural Input Search (DNIS) compares to other related work on neural input search for recommender systems:- Compared to heuristic-based methods like Mixed Dimension Embeddings (MDE), DNIS searches for optimal feature embedding dimensions by directly optimizing a soft selection layer through gradient descent rather than relying on hand-crafted heuristics. This provides more flexibility in finding good dimension configurations.- Compared to reinforcement learning methods like Neural Input Search with Multi-size Embedding (NIS-ME), DNIS searches the continuous space of possible dimensions instead of having to predefine a discrete set of candidate dimensions. This avoids limiting the search to suboptimal choices.- DNIS introduces techniques like gradient normalization and fine-grained pruning to improve stability and get flexible dimension schemes. These help DNIS outperform MDE and NIS-ME.- The paper shows DNIS can be combined with various existing recommender system models like matrix factorization, MLP, etc. This model-agnostic approach makes it widely applicable.- Experiments show DNIS achieves better prediction performance than other input search methods, with fewer parameters and lower training time. The performance gains are shown on multiple tasks and datasets.In summary, DNIS advances neural input search by enabling more flexible search directly through gradients, avoiding restrictive pre-defined search spaces, and introducing custom techniques to stabilize training. The model-agnostic design and comprehensive experiments demonstrate clear improvements over prior specialized heuristic and RL-based methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring more complex schemes for feature blocking, beyond simply dividing features into equal-sized blocks. They mention that more sophisticated methods for grouping similar features could allow for even finer-grained control over embedding dimensions.- Studying the effects of using different base embedding dimensions K for different feature fields or types (e.g., larger K for user/item ids than for context features). The current approach uses a uniform K.- Investigating how to effectively incorporate side information like feature descriptions into the neural input search process. This could help guide the search and improve the learned representations.- Extending the method to handle streaming recommendation scenarios where new features arrive continuously. The current approach performs input search offline. Online adaptation of dimensions could be beneficial.- Applying the differentiable input search approach to other tasks beyond recommendation, such as search, ranking, and classification problems that rely on embedding layers.- Developing theoretical understandings of why and how optimizing validation performance through the proposed method is able to identify important embedding dimensions automatically.Overall, the authors highlight opportunities to enhance the feature blocking, adapt the search process based on feature characteristics, incorporate additional information sources, handle dynamic environments, generalize the approach to other problems, and establish more theoretical foundations. Advancing research in these directions could further improve and extend neural input search.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Differentiable Neural Input Search (DNIS), a method that searches for mixed feature embedding dimensions in a differentiable manner through gradient descent optimization. The key idea is to introduce a soft selection layer between the embedding layer and interaction layers of a latent factor model, which controls the significance of each embedding dimension. This selection layer is optimized based on the model's validation loss to learn an efficient mixed dimension scheme. A gradient normalization technique is proposed to stabilize training. After optimization, a fine-grained pruning procedure merges the selection layer into the embeddings and prunes uninformative dimensions to derive the final mixed dimensions. Experiments on rating prediction, CTR prediction, and top-k recommendation tasks demonstrate that DNIS achieves better performance than prior neural input search methods like heuristic schemes and reinforcement learning approaches, with significantly fewer parameters and lower training time. The method can be incorporated into various latent factor model architectures. Overall, DNIS provides an effective differentiable optimization approach to learn mixed feature embeddings for recommender systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method called Differentiable Neural Input Search (DNIS) for automatically searching for optimal mixed dimension embeddings in recommender systems. Latent factor models commonly used in recommenders transform sparse input features into dense embeddings. Most models use a uniform embedding dimension, but this may limit performance. Recently, methods have been proposed to search for mixed embedding dimensions, but they restrict dimensions to a predefined discrete set, limiting flexibility. The key idea of DNIS is to introduce a soft selection layer that controls the significance of each embedding dimension. This layer can be optimized via gradient descent to minimize validation loss. DNIS employs feature blocking to reduce the search space and proposes gradient normalization to keep gradients steady during training. After training, a pruning procedure is used to derive a fine-grained mixed dimension scheme. Experiments on three real-world datasets for rating prediction, CTR prediction, and top-k recommendation show DNIS achieves the best performance compared to prior neural input search methods, with fewer parameters and lower training time. The results demonstrate the ability of DNIS to efficiently search a large space of mixed dimensions in a differentiable manner.
