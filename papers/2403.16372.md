# [SignSGD with Federated Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16372)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Distributed learning algorithms train machine learning models by utilizing data distributed across multiple edge devices. They offer acceleration and practicality but suffer from a communication bottleneck due to substantial parameter exchanges. This bottleneck worsens with heterogeneous devices having diverse computational capabilities. Popular algorithms like signSGD with majority vote (signSGD-MV) fail to converge when devices use varied mini-batch sizes.

Solution:
The paper proposes signSGD with federated voting (signSGD-FV) to address heterogeneity. The key idea is to perform weighted majority voting for aggregating 1-bit gradients, using learnable weights assigned to devices. These weights are learned online to prioritize devices with higher capabilities and larger batches. 

Contributions:

1) Provides a coding theory view of distributed signSGD - treating it as a decoding problem with repetition code over parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs) having distinct crossover probabilities.

2) Derives optimal weighted majority vote aggregation by maximizing log-likelihood, assuming perfect knowledge of BSC crossover probabilities.

3) Introduces concept of federated voting to learn weights by comparing local signs and aggregated signs, without needing perfect knowledge. Weights adapt as estimates of log-likelihood ratios.

4) Provides a unified analysis bounding convergence rate using the maximum sign decoding error probability. Demonstrates signSGD-FV's theoretical guarantee of convergence even with heterogeneous batches.

5) Evaluates signSGD-FV on CNNs and CIFAR-10 dataset. Shows superior performance over signSGD-MV in heterogeneous settings, especially with dominant devices. Achieves 32x-100x communication reduction over full precision SGD.

In summary, the paper proposes a weighted majority voting concept for signSGD that adapts to heterogeneous devices. This helps address limitations of prior signSGD algorithms when handling varied device capabilities.
