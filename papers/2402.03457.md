# [Efficient and Interpretable Traffic Destination Prediction using   Explainable Boosting Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03457)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurately predicting future trajectories of traffic entities like pedestrians and vehicles is important for autonomous navigation. Prior deep learning models are accurate but act as black boxes, lacking interpretability. In contrast, glass-box models like Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provide transparency but have lower accuracy.

Solution:
This paper evaluates a GAM variant called Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) on three traffic datasets - Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD), Intersection Drone Dataset (InD) and Argoverse. Separate EBM models are trained to predict the x and y coordinates of the final destination point of trajectories. To enable multi-modal predictions, the target points are clustered into modes. Output probabilities are calculated based on the EBM predictions and log-likelihoods.  

Contributions:
1) First evaluation of glass-box EBM for traffic prediction showing strong results on SDD and InD but lower accuracy on Argoverse.
2) Analysis of feature importance and interactions using partial dependence plots. This provides insights like recent positions being most influential features across datasets.  

Overall, the paper demonstrates EBM's usefulness for transparent and reasonably accurate pedestrian trajectory forecasting. The lower vehicle prediction performance highlights limitations in capturing complex road interactions. Future work can focus on better leveraging map information as input.
