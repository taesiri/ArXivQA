# [Uncertainty Quantification of Set-Membership Estimation in Control and   Perception: Revisiting the Minimum Enclosing Ellipsoid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15962)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents tractable algorithms based on semidefinite programming to compute tight over-approximations of set-membership estimators (SME) in the form of minimum enclosing ellipsoids (MEE). After introducing the sums-of-squares hierarchy for approximating the MEE of basic semialgebraic sets, the authors contribute three key computational enhancements to make this framework practical for modern control and perception problems: (1) a preprocessing technique to prune redundant constraints that scales to trajectories with thousands of data points, (2) a generalized relaxed Chebyshev center formulation that provides tighter bounds and handles nonconvex sets, and (3) a reduction that allows enclosing rotations on the non-Euclidean manifold SO(3) by solving an equivalent problem in Euclidean space. These algorithms are showcased on challenging system identification tasks, including dynamics that are provably hard to learn, and on a real-world object pose estimation example. Experiments demonstrate the ability to compute tight uncertainty quantification bounds on these problems where previous methods struggle. Key limitations still include computational scalability and handling partial observations. Overall, this work makes promising progress towards reliable set-membership learning for control and perception.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents tractable algorithms based on sums-of-squares programming and semidefinite relaxations to efficiently compute minimum volume enclosing ellipsoids that approximate set-membership estimators arising in control and computer vision applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to set-membership estimation and computing minimum enclosing ellipsoids:

1. It introduces a hierarchy of enclosing ellipsoids based on sums-of-squares relaxations that asymptotically converge to the minimum enclosing ellipsoid (MEE) of a basic semialgebraic set. This provides a tractable way to simplify set-membership estimators.

2. It provides three computational enhancements to make the sums-of-squares framework more practical: (a) an algorithm to prune redundant constraints, (b) a generalized relaxed Chebyshev center formulation, and (c) a technique to handle non-Euclidean geometry like rotations. 

3. It shows how the framework can be applied to modern control and perception problems like system identification and object pose estimation. Previous works have not explored the potential of this approach in these contexts.  

4. It conducts extensive experiments, using the proposed computational improvements, on challenging system ID and pose estimation instances that were not previously possible. This demonstrates the practical viability of the approach.

In summary, the main contribution is making set-membership estimation via MEE tractable for modern applications by proposing a hierarchy of tractable convex relaxations and several problem-specific computational improvements to enhance scalability. The utility is showcased on non-trivial experiments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Set-membership estimation (SME): A framework for model estimation that makes assumptions on noise being unknown but bounded, rather than statistical distributional assumptions. Provides guaranteed bounds on estimation uncertainty.

- Minimum enclosing ellipsoid (MEE): Simple representations of the set estimates from SME that allow for point estimates, worst-case error bounds, and sampling.

- Sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxations: Convex optimization techniques based on semidefinite programming that can optimize polynomials and asymptotically converge to solutions of hard nonconvex polynomial problems.

- Hierarchy of enclosing ellipsoids: The paper's proposed SOS-based algorithms for approximating the MEE, with asymptotic convergence guarantees. 

- Computational enhancements: Three main techniques proposed to make the SOS algorithms more practical - constraints pruning, generalized relaxed Chebyshev center, and handling non-Euclidean geometry.

- System identification: Estimating unknown parameters of dynamical systems, one of the application areas explored.

- Object pose estimation: Estimating position and orientation of objects from images, the other main application area.

In summary, the key focus is on uncertainty quantification via set-membership estimation, with tractable SOS optimization algorithms to compute tight minimum enclosing ellipsoids even for complex nonconvex sets.

8. The computational experiments reveal tradeoffs between relaxation order, constraint set size, and performance. Analyze these tradeoffs and how the enhancements address them for practical problems.

9. Compared to existing methods like RANSAC and bounding boxes, what are some quantitative and qualitative advantages observed experimentally from using minimum enclosing ellipsoids?

10. The paper focuses on uncertaintly quantification with deterministic guarantees. How might the proposed ellipsoidal approximations fit into or enable statistical approaches like Bayesian inference?
