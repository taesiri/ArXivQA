# [Interpretable factorization of clinical questionnaires to identify   latent factors of psychopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Standardized questionnaires are commonly used in psychiatry research and practice for screening, diagnosis, and measuring severity of mental health conditions. However, factor analysis methods used to analyze these questionnaires have some limitations:
	- Resulting factors may not be interpretable or meaningful
	- Solutions can be confounded by variables like age, sex, etc. 
	- Require imputation of missing data
	- Solutions are not stable with small sample sizes
	
Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Interpretability Constrained Questionnaire Factorization (ICQF)", a non-negative matrix factorization method tailored for questionnaire data. 

Key Features and Contributions:
- Encodes constraints to enhance interpretability of factors:
	- Factor values bounded in [0,1] range
	- Factor loadings constrained to questionnaire response range  
	- Reconstructed matrix bounded by questionnaire range
	- Directly handles missing data
- Allows inclusion of pre-specified factors to capture confounding variables
- Provides an optimization procedure with convergence guarantees to local minima and global minima under certain conditions
- Introduces automated procedure to accurately detect number of factors 
- Validates method on synthetic data and real questionnaire data from two clinical studies
- Shows ICQF improves interpretability while preserving diagnostic information compared to baseline methods
- Provides efficient implementation to handle typical questionnaire datasets

Overall, the key contribution is a specialized matrix factorization technique for questionnaire data that enhances interpretability and stability of solutions while preserving information relevant for clinical diagnosis. This is achieved via novel constraints matched to domain characteristics, robust automation of parameters, and a custom optimization strategy. Experiments on real data demonstrate advantages over traditional methods used in this area.
