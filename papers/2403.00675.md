# [Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via   Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically require a large amount of interaction data with the environment to learn good policies. However, in many real-world scenarios, online interaction can be expensive or dangerous. Reusing historical trajectories to accelerate policy learning is an important research problem. Prior works often apply importance sampling to reuse trajectories but lack theoretical justification on the bias induced due to trajectory dependence across iterations. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a variant of natural policy gradient algorithm called RNPG that reuses historical trajectories via importance sampling to accelerate policy optimization. Both the policy gradient estimator and the Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimator in RNPG utilize past trajectories. Rigorous theoretical analyses based on stochastic approximation are provided on the convergence and improved convergence rate of RNPG. Specifically,

- Show the bias induced by reusing trajectories is asymptotically negligible using ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach. RNPG shares the same limit ODE as vanilla natural policy gradient, ensuring convergence.  

- Characterize the improved convergence rate using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach. Reusing trajectories reduces the asymptotic variance of gradient estimates, leading to faster convergence.

- Demonstrate reduced gradient variance with constant step size using non-asymptotic analyses.

The analyses justify reusing historical data and show improved sample efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- Propose RNPG algorithm that reuses historical trajectories in both gradient and FIM estimation in natural policy gradient framework.

- Provide rigorous theoretical justification on the asymptotic convergence and improved convergence rate when reusing historical trajectories. 

- Empirically demonstrate the benefit of reusing on classical RL benchmarks. The analyses and experiments provide useful insights on effectively reusing historical data in policy optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a variant of natural policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning that reuses historical trajectories via importance sampling to accelerate learning, analyzes its asymptotic convergence, and shows both theoretically and empirically that reusing past trajectories improves the convergence rate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a variant of the natural policy gradient algorithm (called RNPG) which reuses historical trajectories via importance sampling to accelerate the learning of the optimal policy. 

2. Providing a rigorous asymptotic convergence analysis of the proposed RNPG algorithm using the ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach. Showing that the bias from reusing trajectories is asymptotically negligible and RNPG shares the same limit ODE as vanilla NPG without reusing.

3. Characterizing the improved convergence rate of RNPG using the stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach. Showing that reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate by an order of O(1/K), where K is the reuse size. 

4. Empirically demonstrating the benefit of reusing historical trajectories in RNPG over vanilla NPG on classical RL benchmark problems like cartpole and MuJoCo inverted pendulum.

5. Verifying the asymptotic normality of the normalized error in RNPG on a linear quadratic control problem.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an improved natural policy gradient algorithm via reusing historical trajectories, with theoretical analysis on its convergence and convergence rate, plus empirical verification on benchmark problems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Natural policy gradient: An algorithm that performs natural gradient descent in the policy parameter space to accelerate policy optimization. It considers the geometry of the policy space.

- Importance sampling: A technique to reuse historical trajectories/data to estimate policy gradients by correcting for the difference between behavior policy (policy that generated data) and target policy (policy being improved).

- Convergence analysis: The paper provides convergence guarantees for the proposed natural policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling. It shows the bias introduced by reusing data is asymptotically negligible. 

- Convergence rate: The paper characterizes the improved convergence rate when reusing historical trajectories, showing it reduces variance. 

- Ordinary differential equations (ODE): Used to study the asymptotic convergence by showing the algorithm converges to the solution trajectory of an ODE.  

- Stochastic differential equations (SDE): Used to characterize the asymptotic convergence rate.

- Policy optimization: The overall goal is to optimize the policy to maximize expected discounted rewards in reinforcement learning. The paper focuses on policy gradient methods.

So in summary, the key topics are natural policy gradients, importance sampling for reusing trajectories, convergence and convergence rate analysis, ODE/SDE analysis, and policy optimization in reinforcement learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes reusing historical trajectories to reduce variance in the natural policy gradient algorithm. However, reusing old trajectories introduces bias due to dependence between iterations. How does the paper rigorously analyze this bias and show that it becomes asymptotically negligible?

2. The convergence proof relies on showing the continuous-time interpolations of certain bias and noise terms have zero asymptotic rate of change. What is the formal definition of "zero asymptotic rate of change" provided in the paper and how is this concept utilized in the proofs? 

3. The paper shows that the proposed algorithm (RNPG) shares the same limit ODE as the vanilla natural policy gradient algorithm (VNPG) that does not reuse trajectories. What does this indicate about the asymptotic convergence properties and what does the ODE characterize?

4. How does the paper characterize the improved convergence rate from reusing trajectories using stochastic differential equations? What drives the reduction in asymptotic variance by a factor of O(1/K)?

5. The likelihood ratio for weighting reused trajectories can be difficult to compute in practice. What approximation does the paper suggest instead and how does this impact the convergence guarantees?

6. How is the proposed idea of reusing trajectories extended from natural policy gradient to trust region policy optimization in the paper? What modifications need to be made?

7. What are the key regularity conditions and assumptions made in Section 3 about the MDP, policy parameterization, discounted occupany measure etc. to facilitate the convergence analysis? How reasonable are they?

8. The non-asymptotic analysis suggests benefits of reusing trajectories even with constant step sizes. How does the proof bound the gradient estimation error probabilistically and what explains the variance reduction?

9. How is the asymptotic normality result for the normalized error process verified empirically in the paper? What can we deduce about asymptotic normality from the Q-Q plots?

10. Could the likelihood ratio weighting idea be combined with other variance reduction strategies like selectively reusing only more relevant samples? What challenges might this introduce in the analysis?
