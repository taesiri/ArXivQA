# [Efficient Data Shapley for Weighted Nearest Neighbor Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to address an open problem in data valuation literature concerning the efficient computation of Data Shapley for weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithms. Specifically, prior work has shown that exact Data Shapley can be computed in O(N log N) time for unweighted KNN. However, for the more general weighted KNN, the best known algorithm has a complexity of O(N^K), which becomes impractical even for small K like 5. Closing this efficiency gap to enable practical applications of weighted KNN Shapley is an important open problem.

Proposed Solution:
The paper makes two key adjustments to make the WKNN configuration more amenable to efficient Shapley value computation - using hard label WKNN instead of soft label, and discretizing the continuous weights. Under this adjusted setting, the paper shows that WKNN Shapley computation can be framed as a counting problem. Leveraging this insight, they develop:

1) A quadratic time algorithm for exact WKNN Shapley computation, significantly improving upon the O(N^K) baseline. 

2) A subquadratic time deterministic approximation algorithm for WKNN Shapley that preserves desirable fairness properties of the exact Shapley value.

Main Contributions:

- The first algorithm for exact WKNN Shapley computation with quadratic O(N^2) time complexity, enabling its practical adoption

- A deterministic approximation algorithm with subquadratic runtime that maintains fairness properties, unlike prevailing stochastic approximations 

- Extensive experiments demonstrating the efficiency of the algorithms, and WKNN Shapley's superior performance over unweighted KNN Shapley in discerning data quality

The key insight is making proper adjustments to the WKNN configuration to frame Shapley computation as a counting problem. This facilitates the development of much more efficient algorithms compared to directly using the original WKNN setup. The proposed techniques significantly widen the applicability of weighted KNN Shapley.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops efficient algorithms for computing and approximating the Shapley value of data points for weighted K-nearest neighbors classifiers, addressing an open problem from prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Making adjustments to the configuration of weighted KNN to make it more amenable for efficient computation of the Shapley value (termed WKNN-Shapley). Specifically, the paper focuses on hard-label weighted KNN classifiers with discretized weight values.

2. Developing a quadratic-time algorithm for exactly computing WKNN-Shapley, significantly improving upon the previous best known algorithm which had a complexity of O(N^K). 

3. Proposing a subquadratic-time deterministic approximation algorithm for WKNN-Shapley that preserves key fairness properties of the exact Shapley value.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrating the efficiency gains of the proposed exact and approximated algorithms for WKNN-Shapley, as well as showing that WKNN-Shapley outperforms unweighted KNN-Shapley in discerning data quality for tasks like mislabeled/noisy data detection and data selection.

In summary, the main contribution is developing efficient algorithms for computing/approximating WKNN-Shapley, a principled data valuation technique, to facilitate its adoption. Proper modifications to the weighted KNN setup are first made to enable these computational improvements.
