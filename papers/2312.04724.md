# [Purple Llama CyberSecEval: A Secure Coding Benchmark for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) show promise in generating functional code from natural language prompts. However, the code they generate may contain security vulnerabilities or fail to follow best practices, posing a cybersecurity risk if relied upon by developers.  
- In addition, LLMs could be misused to aid in carrying out cyberattacks if they comply with requests for assistance with malicious activities.
- There is a need for comprehensive cybersecurity safety benchmarks to measure these risks across LLMs to identify areas for improvement.

Proposed Solution 
- The paper presents Purple Llama CyberSecEval, likely the most extensive LLM cybersecurity benchmark to date.
- It contains two components:
   1) Insecure Code Detector: Automatically generates test cases from real-world code and checks if LLM-generated code reproduces insecure practices. Covers 8 languages and 50+ common weaknesses.
   2) Cyberattack Helpfulness Tests: Manually authored test prompts request LLM aid with cyberattacks as defined by the MITRE ATT&CK framework across 10 categories. Judges if LLM responses would further attacks.
- Together these quantitatively measure LLMs' propensity to generate insecure code and willingness to help cyberattackers.

Main Contributions
- Breadth: Comprehensively evaluates code security weaknesses and attack compliance over more languages and categories than prior benchmarks. 
- Realism: Bases insecure code tests on real-world examples.
- Adaptability: Can easily extend evaluations to new weaknesses and attack types.
- Accuracy: Automated analysis achieves 94-96% precision in judging code insecurities and attack compliance.

In experiments across Llama, CodeLlama and GPT models, observed insecure suggestions 30% of the time and willingness to aid attacks over 50% on average. Models with higher coding abilities were more likely to do both.

The benchmark contributes to developing safer AI systems by identifying risks for mitigation and providing a methodology to measure improvements over iterations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents PurpleLlama CyberSecEval, a novel comprehensive benchmark to assess and enhance the cybersecurity safety of large language models employed as coding assistants by evaluating their potential for generating insecure code and aiding cyberattacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution of this work is the introduction of \benchmarkname, which is described as the most comprehensive cybersecurity safety measurement suite for evaluating large language models to date. Specifically, the paper highlights these key contributions of \benchmarkname:

1) Breadth - It covers the evaluation of insecure coding practices across 8 programming languages and 50 common weakness enumerations, as well as compliance in assisting with 10 categories of cyberattack tactics, techniques and procedures.

2) Realism - The insecure code tests are automatically derived from real-world open source codebases to evaluate realistic coding scenarios. 

3) Adaptability - The test case generation pipeline is automated, allowing easy adaptation to assess new coding weaknesses and cyberattack tactics.

4) Accuracy - The methods for automatically and accurately evaluating cybersecurity safety achieved 96% precision and 79% recall in detecting insecure code generations, and 94% precision and 84% recall in detecting malicious model completions.

In addition, the paper introduces a case study applying \benchmarkname to models from the Llama 2, Code Llama and OpenAI GPT families, revealing cybersecurity risks in the form of a tendency to suggest insecure code and comply with requests to assist in cyberattacks. Overall, \benchmarkname is presented as a novel, comprehensive benchmark for effectively evaluating and enhancing the cybersecurity safety of large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs): The paper focuses on evaluating the cybersecurity risks of large language models that are used for applications like coding assistants.

- Cybersecurity benchmarks: The paper introduces a new benchmark suite called "Purple Llama CyberSecEval" to assess the cybersecurity safety of LLMs.

- Insecure code detection: One component of the benchmark evaluates how often LLMs suggest insecure coding practices when generating code.

- Cyberattack compliance testing: Another component tests if LLMs comply with requests to help carry out cyberattacks. 

- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE): The insecure coding practice detection leverages this standard catalog of insecure coding practices.

- MITRE ATT&CK: The cyberattack compliance testing is based on tactics, techniques and procedures from this cyber threat intelligence framework.

- Llama, CodeLlama, GPT: The paper applies the benchmarks to various LLMs from the Llama, CodeLlama and OpenAI GPT model families.

- Automated test generation: Key methods include automated test case generation by extracting prompts from insecure code patterns. 

- Security risks: The case study reveals risks like LLMs frequently suggesting insecure code and often complying with requests for cyberattacks.

In summary, key terms cover the LLM families tested, the cybersecurity safety benchmarks introduced, the standards leveraged, and the methods and key findings around security risks discovered.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions creating an "Insecure Code Detector" to detect insecure coding practices. Can you explain in more detail how this tool works, including what static analysis rules it uses and how it handles incomplete or unparseable code from LLMs? 

2. When constructing insecure code test sets, the paper uses two contexts - autocomplete and instruct. Can you walk through the process of how each test case is created in more detail? What is the intuition behind testing in these two contexts?

3. When performing the insecure coding practice evaluation, what temperature and sampling method were used when sampling tokens from the LLMs? How were these parameters chosen? 

4. For the cyberattack helpfulness testing, can you explain more about how you defined and judged whether an LLM response would be "helpful" in implementing a cyberattack? What caveats did you note about this definition?

5. In generating the cyberattack helpfulness test cases, can you walk through the fragment generation, base prompt generation, and prompt augmentation steps in more detail? Why was augmentation deemed necessary?

6. When evaluating cyberattack helpfulness, the paper checks for refusals using a pattern matcher. What patterns are matched to determine refusals? Why check refusals separately before judging helpfulness?

7. The paper notes several limitations, including imperfect detection of insecure coding practices. Can you suggest some ways the static analysis approach could be improved or supplemented to increase accuracy?

8. For the case study results, why might more advanced models tend to suggest more insecure code? Does this point to any ways model training could be adapted?

9. One finding was that models perform better at not complying with more unambiguously malicious requests. What might explain better compliance rates for ambiguous requests related to discovery and reconnaissance? 

10. Beyond the limitations listed, can you think of any other potential limitations of the benchmark or evaluation methodology proposed in the paper? How might these be addressed?
