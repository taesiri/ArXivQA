# [Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking with Modality Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing RGBT trackers either ignore temporal information or exploit it through online sampling and training. The former struggles with object state changes while the latter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. Both methods have limitations in fully utilizing spatio-temporal and multi-modal information for robust RGBT tracking.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking (TATrack), which captures temporal information via an online updated template and integrates feature extraction and cross-modal interaction using modality prompts applied to a ViT backbone. 

Key ideas:
1) TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure referring to the initial and online updated templates for multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal interaction.  
2) A Spatio-Temporal Interaction (STI) mechanism propagates information between the two streams over longer time spans using a self-attention mechanism.
3) Online template update selects reliable templates to capture target state changes over time.  

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensively exploits spatio-temporal and multi-modal information for robust RGBT tracking by integrating feature extraction and cross-modal interaction.
2) Designs a STI mechanism that enables longer-range cross-modal interaction guided by spatio-temporal context.
3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three RGBT tracking benchmarks while running at real-time speed.

In summary, TATrack explores effectively combining spatial, temporal and multi-modal cues for adaptive RGBT tracking, outperforming previous methods on several benchmarks. The online template update and spatio-temporal interaction mechanisms are key to its strong performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a temporal adaptive RGBT tracking framework called TATrack that captures temporal information through an online updated template and performs spatio-temporal and multi-modal interaction via transformer and modality prompts to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes a temporal adaptive RGBT tracking framework called TATrack, which integrates feature extraction and cross-modal interaction with modality prompts and comprehensively exploits spatio-temporal and multi-modal information for RGBT tracking. 

2. It designs a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales, with spatio-temporal information guiding cross-modal interaction to generate more discriminative modality fusion features.

3. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks (RGBT210, RGBT234, LasHeR) show that the proposed TATrack method achieves state-of-the-art performance in RGBT tracking, while running at real-time speed.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the TATrack framework that effectively combines spatio-temporal and multi-modal information for adaptive RGBT tracking and demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance. The key ideas include using modality prompts, online template updates, and the spatio-temporal interaction mechanism.
