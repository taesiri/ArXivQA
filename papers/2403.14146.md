# [Evolving Benchmark Functions to Compare Evolutionary Algorithms via   Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Benchmark functions are important for comparing and analyzing evolutionary algorithms. However, manually designing good benchmark functions is challenging as it requires expert knowledge. Existing benchmark suites also have some limitations such as not resembling real-world problems and algorithms being overfitted to them. 

- This paper explores automatically generating benchmark functions using Genetic Programming (GP) to highlight differences between algorithms. The goal is to generate functions that can effectively differentiate between two optimizers.

Method:
- The paper proposes using GP to evolve mathematical functions, using the distance between solution sets found by two optimizers as the fitness measure. Multidimensional Wasserstein distance is used to calculate this. 

- MAP-Elites is incorporated to maintain diversity and find functions with varying landscape features. The features used are fitness distance correlation (FDC), neutrality and whether the optimizers achieve the same best fitness.

- Two case studies are presented differentiating between:
   1) Two DE configurations 
   2) SHADE and CMA-ES

Results:
- The GP-generated functions could differentiate the algorithm pairs better than CEC 2005 suite, especially in the decision space.

- Heatmaps indicate the DE configurations differ more when FDC and neutrality are close to 0, while SHADE and CMA-ES differ more when FDC > -0.2.

- Analysis of generated functions shows they have characteristics that can highlight differences between the algorithms.

Contributions:
- Novel way to automatically generate benchmark functions based on differentiating optimizer behavior
- Demonstrates the capabilities on two algorithm pairs 
- Provides insights into landscape features affecting algorithm differences
- Can potentially be integrated into hyper-heuristics for algorithm analysis
