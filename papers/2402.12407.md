# [Accelerating local laplacian filters on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image processing techniques like detail enhancement can lead to edge degradation and artifacts like halos. Complex optimization methods have been proposed but are computationally expensive. 
- Local Laplacian Filtering is an effective technique but constructing the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids is very expensive. Prior works use multi-core CPUs and GPUs but FPGAs can provide better performance per watt.

Proposed Solution:
- An FPGA-based hardware accelerator that fully exploits the parallelism in the Local Laplacian Filtering algorithm while minimizing resource usage.

Key Contributions:
- Approximated the Gaussian filter to enable a high throughput convolution engine with pipeline and data parallelism without needing any DSP blocks. 
- Converted the complex remap function computations into a simple table lookup to save resources and latency.
- Designed a 3-stage pipeline with channel, level and pixel parallelism. Can sustain 783 3x3 convolutions per cycle.
- Achieved 7.5x speedup over a highly optimized multi-core CPU implementation with good accuracy (PSNR 30-50dB).
- Showed the architecture can scale further through replication of Level 1 unit while still meeting resource constraints. This improved latency drastically.

In summary, the paper presents a novel FPGA architecture for accelerating Local Laplacian Filtering that exploits all forms of parallelism in the algorithm and achieves much faster processing than CPU/GPU approaches with minimal impact on accuracy. The efficiency of the design leaves scope for further scaling on the hardware.
