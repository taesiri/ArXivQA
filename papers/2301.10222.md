# [RangeViT: Towards Vision Transformers for 3D Semantic Segmentation in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10222)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether vision transformer (ViT) architectures, which have shown great success on image tasks, can be effectively adapted and leveraged to improve 3D semantic segmentation performance on LiDAR point clouds. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) The strong representation learning capacity of ViTs can be exploited for LiDAR semantic segmentation by adapting them with minimal changes to process projected range images.

2) ViT architectures can be unified between modalities (images & LiDAR) so advances in one domain benefit the other. 

3) ViTs pre-trained on large image datasets can be transferred to improve LiDAR segmentation, despite the domain gap.

In summary, the paper questions if the latest advances with ViTs in computer vision can be leveraged to push state-of-the-art in projection-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation. It hypothesizes this is possible by adaptating ViTs with a tailored tokenization process and decoder while exploiting their pre-training on images.
