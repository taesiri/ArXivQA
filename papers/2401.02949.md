# [Graph2Tac: Learning Hierarchical Representations of Math Concepts in   Theorem proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02949)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interactive theorem provers like Coq assist users in writing formal proofs, but require significant manual effort. Machine learning guidance can help, but faces challenges in adapting to new concepts/definitions introduced in different projects.

- Most prior work trains on fixed sets of definitions, and cannot adapt well when proving theorems in new Coq projects with unfamiliar definitions.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop graph-based representations for Coq terms that capture dependencies between definitions. Use this to build a graph neural network model called Graph2Tac (G2T).

- G2T incorporates a novel "definition embedding" task specifically designed to learn representations of definitions, including ones not seen during training. This allows adapting to new projects.

- Integrate G2T into the Tactician framework to make it available to users proving theorems in Coq. Also facilitate comparison to a transformer baseline and Tactician's existing fast k-NN solver.

Key Contributions:

- Showcase a new definition training task and graph representations that substantially boost proving theorems in unfamiliar Coq projects (from 17.4% to 26.1% solved).

- Demonstrate usefulness of tracking dependencies between definitions and theorems as an interconnected graph to handle new concepts.

- First comprehensive comparison of many Coq solvers including neural models, k-NN, and CoqHammer. Surprisingly, simple k-NN rivals more complex methods.

- k-NN and G2T are complementary online solvers - together proving 33.2% of test theorems. G2T outperforms standalone on longer proofs.

- G2T is among the first practical neural Coq solvers conveniently usable by end users, adapting dynamically to users' code by computing representations of newly introduced definitions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a graph neural network model called Graph2Tac that learns representations of mathematical concepts in Coq by exploiting the hierarchical structure of definitions, enabling it to adapt in real time to new projects and effectively complement a nearest neighbor model that learns from proof scripts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper showcases a new definition training task and shows that it improves theorem proving performance in Coq from 17.4% to 26.1% on theorems from new Coq packages not seen during training. This task learns representations of mathematical concepts that can be used when encountering new definitions.

2) The paper demonstrates the usefulness of graph-based representations of Coq terms and definitions that capture the hierarchical dependencies between concepts. This representation is used to develop the Graph2Tac (G2T) graph neural network model.

3) The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of symbolic, machine learning, and neural guidance systems for Coq, including Graph2Tac, a transformer model, the k-Nearest Neighbor model from Tactician, and CoqHammer. It shows the k-NN model is surprisingly powerful despite its simplicity. 

4) The results demonstrate that Graph2Tac and k-NN are complementary online solvers, together proving 33.2% of test theorems. Graph2Tac adapts to new definitions while k-NN adapts to new tactics.

5) Graph2Tac is one of the first practical neural network-based solvers for Coq that is conveniently available for end users to assist with proof development.

In summary, the main contribution is using graph representations and a novel definition training task to develop an online learning system that can adapt to new concepts and assist with theorem proving in Coq.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The graph-based representation of Coq terms seems central to this approach. What are the key advantages of using a graph representation compared to more traditional textual representations? How does it enable the graph neural network architecture?

2. The definition embedding task is a novel aspect of this work. Why is learning representations of definitions that were not seen during training so important in this setting? What does this capability enable?

3. How does the graph neural network architecture incorporate information about the hierarchy of definitions when computing representations of new definitions or proof states? What is the flow of information?

4. This work compares Graph2Tac against several strong baselines like the k-NN model and CoqHammer. What are the key differences between these approaches and why might they complement each other? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The results show that the online learning approaches significantly outperform offline methods when there are 10+ new dependencies. Why does this gap emerge and how do online models address this challenge?

6. Combining Graph2Tac and k-NN leads to substantially better results. What unique capabilities does each method contribute? Why does this combination work so well?

7. The definition task helps even without using definition embeddings at inference time. Why might this be? What role does the definition task play during training?

8. How was the graph dataset constructed? What were some challenges in extracting this graph-based representation faithfully from Coq code? How was the dataset split into train/test?

9. Could this graph-based approach be applied to other interactive theorem provers besides Coq? What changes would need to be made? What unique aspects of Coq were leveraged?

10. The results show Graph2Tac rivaling state-of-the-art systems. What further improvements could push the capabilities even further? What are limitations of the current approach to address?
