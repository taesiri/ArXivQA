# [Fully Spiking Actor Network with Intra-layer Connections for   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient solutions for control tasks but have limitations in solving high-dimensional control problems. Combining SNNs with deep reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome this limitation.
- Existing spike-based RL methods convert the firing rate output of SNNs into continuous actions through a fully-connected (FC) layer. This brings floating-point operations that prevent direct deployment of the full SNN model on neuromorphic hardware.  

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel neural coding method using the membrane voltage of non-spiking neurons to represent continuous RL values (e.g. actions), enabling end-to-end spike-based RL.
- Introduce intra-layer connections in the output neuron populations to enhance action representation capacity. These include self-connections and lateral connections between neurons encoding the same action dimension.  
- Develop a spiking actor network called ILC-SAN with the above components. ILC-SAN can be trained jointly with a deep critic network using RL algorithms.

Main Contributions:
- First fully spiking neural network to achieve comparable performance as mainstream deep RL algorithms on continuous control tasks.
- Membrane voltage coding method solves deployment problem of current spike-based RL methods by avoiding any floating-point operations.
- Intra-layer connections improve representation capacity of output neuron populations.
- ILC-SAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 8 OpenAI Gym tasks and is highly energy-efficient.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel fully spiking neural network called ILC-SAN for continuous control tasks that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being deployable on neuromorphic hardware for energy-efficient inference. The key innovation is the membrane voltage coding method and intra-layer connections in the output populations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a fully spiking actor network with intra-layer connections (ILC-SAN) for reinforcement learning, which uses non-spiking neurons and membrane voltage coding to represent continuous values and adds intra-layer connections in output populations to enhance representation capacity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel coding method to decode spike trains into continuous values (e.g. actions, Q-values) for reinforcement learning using the membrane voltage of non-spiking neurons. This allows for fully spike-based end-to-end reinforcement learning that can be deployed on neuromorphic hardware. 

2. It introduces a novel intra-layer connection mechanism within the output neuron populations to enhance action representation. This includes self connections and lateral connections.

3. It proposes a fully spiking actor network called ILC-SAN that integrates the above two ideas. ILC-SAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym while being hardware friendly. It is the first fully spiking neural network to match the performance of mainstream deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

In summary, the main contributions are: a novel spike decoding method, a new intra-layer connection mechanism, and an end-to-end spiking actor network called ILC-SAN that advances state-of-the-art in terms of both performance and energy efficiency. The proposed ideas facilitate deployment of spike-based reinforcement learning on neuromorphic hardware.
