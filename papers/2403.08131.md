# [Cost-Effective Methodology for Complex Tuning Searches in HPC:   Navigating Interdependencies and Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Tuning searches involving a large number of parameters and routines are becoming common in high-performance computing (HPC). 
- Traditional optimization methods fall short due to the vast exploration spaces and intricate interdependencies among parameters and routines. 
- Analyzing these interdependencies is very costly and there are no guarantees it will succeed. 
- As a result, practitioners often face the dilemma of either conducting separate tuning searches for each routine, thereby overlooking interdependencies, or pursuing a more resource-intensive joint search for all routines.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a methodology to navigate complex tuning search spaces in HPC characterized by many parameters and different levels of interdependence.  
- It follows a bottom-up approach composed of two phases:
   1) Conduct an analysis to tag the influence of different tuning parameters on each routine. This is done through a sensitivity analysis based on runtime variability to individual parameter variations.
   2) Create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the obtained influence scores to represent interdependencies between routines. Solve its partition based on a defined interdependence cutoff to determine whether routines should be merged or not.
- The methodology constrains each search to maximum 10 dimensions and discards less crucial parameters if needed. This allows Bayesian Optimization to navigate the search space efficiently.

Main Contributions:
- Novel sensitivity analysis to capture interdependence between routines while significantly reducing required observations compared to traditional orthogonal analysis.
- Methodology to optimize the set of tuning searches, reducing evaluations needed while increasing solution quality. 
- Demonstrated effectiveness across synthetic functions and a real GPU-accelerated HPC application in chemistry.
- Addresses lack of dedicated Bayesian Optimization approach in HPC for large sets of tuning parameters.
- Reduces costs and bridges gap in state-of-the-art HPC autotuning capabilities.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient methodology to tackle the challenge of complex tuning searches in HPC applications, involving many parameters across different routines, through an optimized set of merged and independent searches.
