# [Cost-Effective Methodology for Complex Tuning Searches in HPC:   Navigating Interdependencies and Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Tuning searches involving a large number of parameters and routines are becoming common in high-performance computing (HPC). 
- Traditional optimization methods fall short due to the vast exploration spaces and intricate interdependencies among parameters and routines. 
- Analyzing these interdependencies is very costly and there are no guarantees it will succeed. 
- As a result, practitioners often face the dilemma of either conducting separate tuning searches for each routine, thereby overlooking interdependencies, or pursuing a more resource-intensive joint search for all routines.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a methodology to navigate complex tuning search spaces in HPC characterized by many parameters and different levels of interdependence.  
- It follows a bottom-up approach composed of two phases:
   1) Conduct an analysis to tag the influence of different tuning parameters on each routine. This is done through a sensitivity analysis based on runtime variability to individual parameter variations.
   2) Create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the obtained influence scores to represent interdependencies between routines. Solve its partition based on a defined interdependence cutoff to determine whether routines should be merged or not.
- The methodology constrains each search to maximum 10 dimensions and discards less crucial parameters if needed. This allows Bayesian Optimization to navigate the search space efficiently.

Main Contributions:
- Novel sensitivity analysis to capture interdependence between routines while significantly reducing required observations compared to traditional orthogonal analysis.
- Methodology to optimize the set of tuning searches, reducing evaluations needed while increasing solution quality. 
- Demonstrated effectiveness across synthetic functions and a real GPU-accelerated HPC application in chemistry.
- Addresses lack of dedicated Bayesian Optimization approach in HPC for large sets of tuning parameters.
- Reduces costs and bridges gap in state-of-the-art HPC autotuning capabilities.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient methodology to tackle the challenge of complex tuning searches in HPC applications, involving many parameters across different routines, through an optimized set of merged and independent searches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a methodology to efficiently navigate complex tuning searches across different routines within HPC applications by adapting high-dimensional decomposition techniques to ensure computational feasibility while maximizing performance gains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a methodology for tackling complex Bayesian optimization-based tuning searches across different routines within a high performance computing (HPC) application. The key aspects of the methodology include:

1) Using a sensitivity analysis to infer interdependencies between tuning parameters and identify routines that should be tuned together vs separately. This reduces the number of observations needed compared to traditional orthogonal analysis. 

2) Creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent the interdependencies and solve the partition problem to decide which routines should be merged into a joint tuning search vs kept separate. This avoids both extremes of fully independent or fully joint searches.

3) Restricting the dimensionality of each tuning search to 10 parameters to allow Bayesian Optimization to efficiently explore the space with a limited number of evaluations, as preferred in HPC due to computational expenses. 

4) Demonstrating the methodology on both synthetic functions and a real-world GPU-accelerated Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (RT-TDDFT) application, showing it can effectively handle complex tuning spaces and interdependencies that state-of-the-art HPC autotuners struggle with.

In summary, the paper introduces a practical methodology to navigate intricate tuning spaces in HPC applications, reducing tuning overhead while improving optimization quality over typical approaches. Its adaptability facilitates applicability to other scientific domains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the methodology consists of two distinct phases. What are these two phases and what is the purpose of each? 

2. Sensitivity analysis is used twice in the methodology. Explain where it is used, for what purpose, and how it helps to reduce the number of required observations.

3. The methodology treats the tuning problem as a partitioning problem on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Explain what the vertices and edges of this DAG represent and how they are used to determine which routines should be merged into a joint search. 

4. When deciding whether to merge interdependent routine searches into a joint higher-dimensional search, what factors influence the choice of cut-off value for the edge pruning mechanism?

5. The methodology limits each search to a maximum of 10 dimensions. Explain the rationale behind this restriction and why it allows Bayesian Optimization to navigate the search space more efficiently.  

6. One of the premises of the methodology is to "prioritize the kernel with highest impact" when the same kernel appears in different regions. Elaborate on what this means and why it is an important consideration.

7. On the synthetic functions, the methodology succeeded in finding configurations with quality improvements up to 8% compared to typical extremes. Analyze these results - why is this improvement significant and what does it demonstrate about the methodology?

8. For the RT-TDDFT application, the methodology resolved a constraint 20 parameter search space that could not be directly explored with existing HPC autotuners. Discuss the key aspects of the methodology that enabled addressing this challenge. 

9. Considering the RT-TDDFT application results, analyze the trade-off between cut-off value and performance gains from a joint higher dimensional search guided by Bayesian Optimization. 

10. The methodology contributes to bridging the gap in lack of BO-based tuning approaches for a large set of parameters in HPC. Elaborate on why this is an important contribution and how it can impact future work.
