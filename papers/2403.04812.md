# [TrafPS: A Shapley-based Visual Analytics Approach to Interpret Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Deep learning models for traffic flow prediction lack transparency and are considered "black boxes". This makes it difficult for analysts and decision makers to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the predictions. 
- Existing methods for interpreting traffic flow predictions have limitations in handling large-scale spatio-temporal data and discovering key spatial and temporal patterns that influence traffic flows.
- There is a need for approaches that can provide intuitive interpretations of model predictions to support traffic management and urban planning decisions. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a visual analytics approach called TrafPS that uses Shapley value based measurements to interpret traffic flow predictions. 
- Two key measurements are proposed:
  - Region SHAP: Quantifies impact of spatial flow patterns on traffic at the region level
  - Trajectory SHAP: Quantifies impact of individual trajectories on traffic in a region
- An interactive visual interface is designed to support multi-level exploration and analysis of interpretations:
  - Overview level shows traffic flow changes spatially
  - Exploration level shows prediction and interpretation for each region
  - Fine-grained level shows prediction details and trajectory impacts for a region

Main Contributions:
- Novel measurements based on Shapley values to quantify spatial and temporal impacts on predicted traffic flows at different scales
- Interactive visual analytics system TrafPS that combines predictions and interpretations to support understanding traffic forecasts 
- Demonstrated effectiveness via real-world case studies and expert interviews in tasks like identifying key congestion routes and supporting traffic management decisions

The paper addresses an important problem of interpreting complex traffic flow forecasting models to support analytical tasks. The solution provides a way to generate and visualize impactful spatial and temporal patterns from model predictions at multiple scales. Expert feedback highlights the usefulness of TrafPS for tasks like congestion analysis and infrastructure planning.
