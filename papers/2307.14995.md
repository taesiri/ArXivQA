# [Scaling TransNormer to 175 Billion Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14995)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we design an efficient linear attention-based transformer model that outperforms conventional softmax attention models in both accuracy and efficiency when scaled up to large language model sizes?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by making several architectural improvements to the TransNormer model, including modifications to the positional encoding, gating mechanisms, normalization, and attention modules, it is possible to create a linear attention-based transformer - called TransNormerLLM - that surpasses softmax attention models like BERT and GPT-3 in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. 

The researchers seem focused on demonstrating that linear attention can be practically superior to softmax attention for large language models, overcoming issues like attention dilution and slow training/inference that have previously hindered adoption of linear attention. By evolving the TransNormer architecture and showing strong results on a massive 2 trillion token dataset, the paper aims to prove the viability of linear attention for state-of-the-art natural language processing.

In summary, the core research question is whether architectural innovations to linear attention can make it excel over softmax attention for large language models, both in accuracy and efficiency. The paper hypothesizes this is achievable through techniques like LRPE, lightning attention, gating, and tensor normalization applied to create TransNormerLLM.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Introducing TransNormerLLM, an improved version of the TransNormer architecture tailored for large language models (LLMs). The key enhancements include:

1) Replacing TransNormer's DiagAttention with full Linear Attention to improve global interactions, while using LRPE with exponential decay to address attention dilution.

2) Adding a gating mechanism (GLA and SGLU) to smooth training. 

3) Using a new tensor normalization scheme called SRMSNorm to accelerate the model.

4) Developing Lightning Attention to accelerate linear attention during training by over 2x and reduce memory usage by 4x. 

5) Creating a robust inference algorithm to ensure numerical stability and consistent inference speed.

- Demonstrating that TransNormerLLM consistently outperforms Transformer models in terms of accuracy and efficiency when scaled up to 175 billion parameters.

- Presenting comprehensive ablation studies to validate the efficacy of the proposed architectural improvements and innovations.

- Introducing a self-collected corpus exceeding 6TB in size and containing over 2 trillion tokens for pretraining, along with a new self-cleaning strategy to ensure data quality.

- Plans to open-source the pre-trained TransNormerLLM models to promote research into efficient transformer structures for LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is developing TransNormerLLM as an efficient linear attention-based LLM architecture that surpasses conventional softmax attention models in both accuracy and efficiency when scaled up to 175B parameters. The paper provides extensive empirical validation through careful ablation studies and model scaling experiments.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper presents TransNormerLLM, a new efficient transformer architecture tailored for large language models (LLMs). Most prior work on efficient transformers focused on encoder-only models for tasks like classification, while this aims to build an efficient decoder-based LLM.

- Previous work on efficient transformers used methods like linear attention, low-rank approximations, kernel-based methods etc. This paper builds on a prior linear attention model called TransNormer, making several modifications like new positional encodings, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and optimized inference to make it suitable for LLMs.

- Most existing large language models use the standard transformer architecture with softmax attention, like GPT-3, PaLM, Chinchilla etc. This paper claims TransNormerLLM is the first linear attention-based LLM to outperform softmax attention in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

- The model is scaled up to 175 billion parameters, which is comparable to the largest existing LLMs like GPT-3 and Chinchilla. The largest linear attention models before this were much smaller in scale.

- They collect a very large self-supervised training corpus totaling over 6TB and 2 trillion tokens. Most other LLMs use generic web-crawled data, while this paper describes a multi-step cleaning process to extract high quality data.

- The paper includes extensive ablation studies and experiments to validate the improvements of TransNormerLLM over vanilla Transformers and the previous TransNormer model. The optimizations like lightning attention and robust inference are rigorously evaluated.

- Unlike many recent LLMs, the authors plan to open source their models to promote further research. Many other state-of-the-art LLMs are closed-source and not reproducible.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of efficient transformer design for LLMs, and is one of the first to demonstrate superior results compared to standard softmax attention at large scale. The open-sourced models and optimizations could have a significant impact on future work in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?
