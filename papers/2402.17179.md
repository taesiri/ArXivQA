# [Dual-Space Optimization: Improved Molecule Sequence Design by Latent   Prompt Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Designing molecules with desirable properties like drug-likeliness and binding affinity to targets is very challenging due to the vast search space. Existing methods either perform combinatorial search directly in the discrete molecular graph space or optimize in a continuous latent space, both having limitations. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Dual-Space Optimization (DSO) approach that integrates latent space sampling and data space selection. The key components are:

1) A novel Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT) generative model that captures the joint distribution of molecular sequences and properties. It consists of a prior model, a seq2seq Transformer for generation conditioned on a latent prompt, and a predictor model for the properties.

2) An optimization algorithm that alternates between (i) sampling candidate molecules from LPT in the latent space based on desired property values (ii) selecting the best molecules using oracle functions in data space and (iii) updating LPT based on selected real samples. This shifts both the model distribution and an elite set towards optimal property values.

Main Contributions:

- Propose the DSO framework combining strengths of latent space modeling and data space selection for molecule optimization.

- Introduce LPT, a new latent variable model for molecular sequences and properties, enabling conditional generation capabilities.

- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across tasks including constrained molecule generation, multi-objective optimization, maximizing binding affinity and solubility.

- Provide an excellent case study for targeting NAD binding site of PHGDH, an important anti-cancer target. Both match and outperform human-designed molecules.

- Achieve new benchmarks in biological sequence optimization tasks involving protein fluorescence and DNA-protein binding affinity.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and highly effective DSO strategy powered by the LPT model for advancing molecular design and optimization.
