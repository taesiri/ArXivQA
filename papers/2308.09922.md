# [MDCS: More Diverse Experts with Consistency Self-distillation for   Long-tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09922)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we improve multi-expert methods for long-tailed recognition by increasing the diversity of experts and reducing model variance?Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called MDCS (More Diverse experts with Consistency Self-distillation) to address two key limitations of prior multi-expert methods for long-tailed recognition:1. Lack of diversity among experts - Previous methods did not sufficiently promote diversity among the experts, resulting in reduced overall performance. 2. High model variance - Prior methods focused on ensembling to reduce final variance but did not address the variance within each expert model. High variance indicates overfitting.To address these issues, MDCS has two main components:1. Diversity Loss (DL) - Promotes diversity among experts by controlling their focus on different categories of data (many-shot, medium-shot, few-shot).2. Consistency Self-Distillation (CS) - Reduces model variance and prevents overfitting by distilling knowledge from weakly augmented data to provide richer supervision for strongly augmented data. Also uses Confident Instance Sampling to avoid biased/noisy knowledge.The paper shows through analysis and experiments that MDCS improves diversity and reduces variance compared to prior art. It also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on five benchmark long-tailed recognition datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.In summary, the main research contributions are in designing a multi-expert method that specifically targets increasing diversity and reducing variance to advance the state-of-the-art in long-tailed recognition. The core ideas are Diversity Loss and Consistency Self-Distillation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel method called MDCS (More Diverse experts with Consistency Self-distillation) for improving long-tailed recognition. MDCS contains two key components:1) Diversity Loss (DL): This promotes diversity among experts by controlling their focus on different categories. It uses an adjustable distribution weight to make each expert focus on different types of categories (e.g. many-shot, medium-shot, few-shot).2) Consistency Self-Distillation (CS): This distills richer knowledge from weakly augmented instances to provide more supervision for strongly augmented instances. It helps reduce model variance and prevent overfitting. A Confident Instance Sampling method is used to select correct samples for CS to avoid introducing biased/noisy knowledge.- Showing through analysis and experiments that MDCS can effectively increase diversity of experts, reduce model variance, and improve recognition accuracy compared to previous methods.- Achieving new state-of-the-art results on five benchmark long-tailed datasets, outperforming previous methods by 1-2% in terms of top-1 accuracy. For example, 56.1% on CIFAR100-LT and 61.8% on ImageNet-LT.- Demonstrating that the DL and CS components are mutually reinforcing - CS benefits from DL's increase in diversity, while DL alone is less effective without CS.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the MDCS method to improve long-tailed recognition through synergistically increasing expert diversity and reducing model variance. The strong experimental results validate the effectiveness of MDCS against prior state-of-the-art.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in long-tailed recognition:- It focuses on improving diversity and reducing variance of multi-expert methods. Previous multi-expert approaches like RIDE, ACE, and SADE tried to improve diversity but did not handle it as effectively. The authors propose a diversity loss and consistency self-distillation to better address these issues.- For diversity, the paper introduces an adjustable distribution weight to make each expert focus on different categories (many-shot, medium-shot, few-shot). This is a simple yet effective way to increase diversity that outperforms prior methods.- For variance reduction, the consistency self-distillation transfers knowledge from weakly augmented images to regularize strongly augmented images. The confident instance sampling helps avoid biased/noisy knowledge. This is a novel way to reduce variance that is shown to be more effective than just model ensembling or label smoothing alone.- The paper demonstrates through analysis and experiments that the proposed techniques increase diversity and reduce variance. The roles of the diversity loss and consistency self-distillation are shown to be mutually reinforcing.- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on five popular long-tailed benchmarks, outperforming prior art by 1-2% in accuracy. This includes gains on CIFAR, ImageNet, Places, and iNaturalist datasets.In summary, the key novelty and contributions are in effectively improving multi-expert diversity and reducing variance through the proposed diversity loss and consistency self-distillation techniques. The analyses and results demonstrate these advances over prior work in long-tailed recognition.
