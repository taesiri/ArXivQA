# [Parameter-Efficient Tuning of Large Convolutional Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Parameter-Efficient Tuning of Large Convolutional Models":

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained models like convolutional neural networks on downstream tasks can be computationally expensive and lead to overfitting due to limited target data. 
- Existing parameter-efficient methods do not carefully treat the convolutional layers which are fundamental building blocks in many models.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate convolutional neural networks over a "filter subspace" by decomposing each convolutional layer's filters into a small set of "filter atoms" that are linearly combined by "atom coefficients".
- Enable efficient fine-tuning by only adapting the filter atoms, which typically contain only a small number of parameters, while fixing the atom coefficients.
- Further expand the filter subspace into an overcomplete space to allow more parameters for tuning by recursively decomposing each filter atom over another set of atoms.

Main Contributions:
- Propose an efficient fine-tuning method for convolutional models that preserves their spatial representation by adjusting filter atoms.
- Demonstrate a simple way to expand the filter subspace for more tuning capacity by recursive decomposition of atoms.  
- Conduct extensive experiments showing the method outperforms baselines in accuracy while using orders of magnitude fewer fine-tuning parameters, for both discriminative (classification) and generative (image synthesis) tasks.
- Show the approach is complementary to existing fine-tuning techniques and can balance performance vs computational budgets.

In summary, the paper introduces a way to efficiently fine-tune large convolutional models by operating in a filter subspace that preserves spatial structure and can be easily expanded, outperforming other methods on downstream tasks.

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing an efficient fine-tuning method for convolutional models by formulating convolutional layers over a filter subspace. This allows efficient tuning while maintaining spatial information by adjusting a small number of filter atoms.

2. Demonstrating a simple yet effective way to achieve an overcomplete filter subspace by recursively decomposing filter atoms. This expands the parameter space available for fine-tuning when needed.
