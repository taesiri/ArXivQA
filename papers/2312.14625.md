# [Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Assessing False-Data   Injection Attacks on Transportation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reliance on navigation apps makes transportation networks vulnerable to data manipulation attacks. Adversaries could inject false traffic information to interfere with drivers' route selections.
- This can significantly increase traffic congestion, waste time/resources, and disrupt essential services relying on road networks. 
- Finding optimal attacks is computationally challenging and limits vulnerability assessments.

Proposed Solution:
- Devise an adversarial model with a threat actor that can manipulate drivers by increasing perceived travel times on certain roads. 
- Use hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL) to find an approximate optimal adversarial strategy for data manipulation.
- HMARL has a high-level agent that coordinates lower-level agents. The lower-level agents observe local information and collaborate to find the best local false data injection strategy.

Key Contributions:
- Adversarial model formalizing the optimization problem faced by attacker seeking to maximize total vehicle travel time.
- HMARL approach with high-level agent allocating attack budget and low-level agents finding local optimal manipulations.
- Demonstration of HMARL method on Sioux Falls network topology, increasing total travel time by 50% and outperforming baselines.
- Framework and analysis to assess vulnerability of transportation networks to data manipulation attacks.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel HMARL framework to model data manipulation attacks against drivers using navigation apps. Experiments show this computational approach can find high-impact attacks that significantly increase congestion. The methods enable more rigorous vulnerability assessments to be conducted.
