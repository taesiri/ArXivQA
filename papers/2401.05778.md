# [Risk Taxonomy, Mitigation, and Assessment Benchmarks of Large Language   Model Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05778)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively surveys the risks across input, model, toolchain, and output modules of large language model systems, and reviews mitigation strategies and evaluation benchmarks to facilitate the development of responsible and trustworthy language technologies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a comprehensive, module-oriented taxonomy that systematically categorizes the risks and mitigation strategies associated with each module of a large language model (LLM) system. Specifically, it analyzes risks related to the input module, language model module, toolchain module, and output module.

2) It reviews common benchmarks used for evaluating the safety and security of LLM systems, covering aspects like robustness, truthfulness, ethics, and bias. 

3) It provides a systematic perspective and guidance to help developers build more responsible LLM systems, by attributing potential risks to specific system modules and suggesting targeted mitigation strategies.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed taxonomy that takes a module-based view to organize LLM risks and defenses, aiming to facilitate the development of beneficial LLM systems.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but they also raise concerns about safety and security issues. However, existing work has mostly focused on analyzing risks in generated outputs, lacking a systematic perspective across the modules of an LLM system. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper conducts an extensive survey on the safety and security of LLM systems. The key contributions are:

1. Proposing a module-oriented taxonomy that categorizes risks and mitigations associated with each module of an LLM system, including the input module, language model module, toolchain module, and output module. 

2. Surveying potential risks related to each LLM module, such as adversarial prompts, privacy leakage, toxicity, hallucinations, and software vulnerabilities.

3. Reviewing mitigation strategies to address these risks, including defensive prompt design, data interventions, safety training methods, knowledge grounding, and watermarking.

4. Summarizing benchmarks and recent evaluations to assess the robustness, truthfulness, ethics, and biases of LLMs.

Main Highlights:  
- The taxonomy provides a systematic perspective for participants to comprehend risks specific to different LLM modules and choose appropriate defenses. 
- The paper investigates emerging threats like adversarial prompts, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities in deployment tools, covering safety and security issues more comprehensively compared to prior surveys.
- Mitigation strategies are extensively discussed according to the taxonomy, guiding developers to build more reliable LLM systems.
- Assessments of state-of-the-art LLMs using robustness and ethics benchmarks reveal existing limitations.

Overall, this survey serves as an essential guidance for the community to embrace a systematic view when developing beneficial LLM systems. The proposed taxonomy and extensive analysis lay the groundwork for reliable and responsible LLMs.
