# [The Surprising Effectiveness of Diffusion Models for Optical Flow and   Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01923)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can diffusion models be effective for optical flow and monocular depth estimation, despite not having specialized architectures or losses designed for these tasks?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Diffusion models can achieve competitive or state-of-the-art results on optical flow and monocular depth estimation benchmarks, using only a generic image-to-image translation framework.2) Diffusion models can capture uncertainty and multimodality in optical flow and depth estimation, unlike typical regression-based approaches. 3) Diffusion models enable useful applications like iterative 3D scene generation, by allowing sampling of conditional distributions and imputation of missing values.So in summary, the paper aims to demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of generic diffusion models on optical flow and monocular depth tasks, highlighting their ability to model uncertainty and enable new applications compared to specialized regression-based approaches. The experiments and results focus on validating these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper seem to be:- Formulating optical flow and monocular depth estimation as image-to-image translation using generic diffusion models, without specialized architectures or loss functions.- Identifying key challenges with training diffusion models on real-world data with noisy/incomplete labels, and proposing solutions like infilling missing values, step-unrolled training, and using an L1 loss.- Showing strong results on optical flow and depth benchmarks, including state-of-the-art performance on KITTI optical flow. The diffusion model gets an Fl-all outlier rate of 3.26% on KITTI, about 25% better than prior work.- Demonstrating additional benefits of the diffusion modeling approach, like capturing uncertainty and multi-modality in the predictions, and enabling zero-shot applications like coarse-to-fine refinement and imputation of missing values.Overall, the key contribution seems to be showing that with proper training techniques, generic diffusion models can achieve excellent performance on specialized vision tasks like optical flow and depth estimation, without task-specific model components. The results also highlight the benefits of probabilistic modeling and sampling for these tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes using generic denoising diffusion probabilistic models for monocular depth and optical flow estimation, achieving strong results without specialized model architectures or losses; the diffusion framework also enables representing uncertainty and multimodality.
