# [The Surprising Effectiveness of Diffusion Models for Optical Flow and   Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01923)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can diffusion models be effective for optical flow and monocular depth estimation, despite not having specialized architectures or losses designed for these tasks?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Diffusion models can achieve competitive or state-of-the-art results on optical flow and monocular depth estimation benchmarks, using only a generic image-to-image translation framework.2) Diffusion models can capture uncertainty and multimodality in optical flow and depth estimation, unlike typical regression-based approaches. 3) Diffusion models enable useful applications like iterative 3D scene generation, by allowing sampling of conditional distributions and imputation of missing values.So in summary, the paper aims to demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of generic diffusion models on optical flow and monocular depth tasks, highlighting their ability to model uncertainty and enable new applications compared to specialized regression-based approaches. The experiments and results focus on validating these hypotheses.
