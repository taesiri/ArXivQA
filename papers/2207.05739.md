# [A Data-Based Perspective on Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05739)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How does the composition of the source dataset impact transfer learning performance on downstream tasks?In particular, the paper develops a framework to quantify the influence of different parts of the source dataset (classes or individual examples) on the predictions of the transfer learning model on the target dataset. This allows them to understand what aspects of the source data are most utilized during transfer, identify detrimental data in the source dataset, extract subpopulations in the target dataset, and debug transfer mistakes. The overall goal is to shed light on the role of the source dataset in driving transfer learning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a framework for analyzing the impact of the source dataset's composition on transfer learning performance. The key contributions are:- It introduces a methodology to estimate the influence of source dataset classes (or individual datapoints) on the predictions of a model transferred to a downstream task. This allows pinpointing which parts of the source dataset are most impactful.- Using the proposed influence estimation, the paper demonstrates several capabilities enabled by this framework:1) Improving transfer learning performance by removing detrimental source data identified through negative influences. Experiments show this gives better accuracy than using the full source dataset.2) Automatically extracting granular subpopulations in the target dataset by projecting the fine-grained source labels. 3) Debugging mistakes made by the transferred model using influence values to identify detrimental source datapoints. 4) Detecting potential data leakage between source and target datasets.- The framework provides a novel data-driven perspective for understanding and improving transfer learning, as opposed to just analyzing properties of the pre-trained model.- Experiments demonstrate the utility of this methodology on image classification tasks transferring from ImageNet to various target datasets. The framework helps shed light on the role of the source dataset in the transfer learning process.In summary, the main contribution is a principled framework to measure the impact of the source dataset on transfer learning performance, enabling new capabilities for improving and interpreting transfer learning. The paper provides both methodology and empirical evidence demonstrating the utility of this perspective.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on transfer learning compares to other related work:- It takes a novel perspective by framing transfer learning as an interaction between datasets rather than just properties of the model or training procedure. This allows the authors to systematically study the impact of the composition of the source dataset on downstream performance.- The proposed framework of estimating "influence values" for source dataset classes/examples enables capabilities not seen in prior work, like removing detrimental source data to improve transfer or projecting source labels to extract target subpopulations.- Whereas most prior work studied coarse properties of the source dataset like size or number of classes, this paper can provide fine-grained analysis of which specific subsets impact transfer learning positively or negatively.- The counterfactual experiments removing influential source classes demonstrate larger gains on many datasets compared to prior heuristic transfer learning techniques like hand-picking relevant source classes.- The paper connects to and adapts ideas like influence functions and data Shapley values from the interpretability literature to provide insights into transfer learning.- Limitations compared to some other work include the computational cost of training many source models, and the restriction to studying image classification tasks.Overall, the data-centric perspective and framework introduced provide novel ways to understand and improve transfer learning that nicely complement the existing literature's focus on properties of the model and training process. The counterfactual analysis and projected labeling capabilities enabled are particularly unique contributions.
