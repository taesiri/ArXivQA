# [A Blockchain Solution for Collaborative Machine Learning over IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14136)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel architecture for collaborative machine learning across IoT devices that integrates federated learning using the XuILVQ algorithm with Ethereum blockchain technology. The decentralized system allows nodes to train models on local data and share only prototype updates to improve global model accuracy while preserving data privacy. A distributed ledger provides a tamper-proof platform to store and share prototypes securely. The architecture incorporates SwiftAgg+ protocol for secure data aggregation between sensors and nodes, enhancing system security. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to centralized learning, with accuracy moderately correlated to number of nodes. Secure aggregation testing also validates the system's resilience against potential attacks. By reducing communication overheads while prioritizing privacy, the proposed solution addresses key challenges in distributed machine learning for IoT environments, opening possibilities for advanced analytics in applications requiring secure collaborative intelligence across devices.
