# [AlphaFin: Benchmarking Financial Analysis with Retrieval-Augmented   Stock-Chain Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stock trend prediction and financial question answering are important for financial analysis. However, ML/DL models can only provide uncertain predictions without explainability. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and inability to provide real-time information.  

Proposed Solution - AlphaFin & Stock-Chain Framework
- Release AlphaFin benchmark datasets containing research data, real-time finance data, handwritten chain-of-thoughts data to enhance LLM abilities.  
- Propose a Stock-Chain framework:
    - Stage 1: Fine-tune StockGPT LLM for stock trend prediction, integrate real-time data through retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
    - Stage 2: Continue fine-tuning StockGPT for financial question answering, also integrated with RAG.

Main Contributions:
- Formalize financial analysis task, release AlphaFin datasets
- Propose Stock-Chain framework to fine-tune LLMs with AlphaFin data and integrate RAG
- Experiments show Stock-Chain achieves state-of-the-art 30.8% annualized return for prediction and high-quality outputs for question answering
- Provides interpretable predictions, enhances user confidence in investment decisions

In summary, the paper tackles limitations of existing models for financial analysis via released datasets and a novel Stock-Chain framework with integrated RAG. Extensive experiments validate state-of-the-art performance on prediction accuracy and financial question answering ability.
