# [H3DFact: Heterogeneous 3D Integrated CIM for Factorization with   Holographic Perceptual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Disentangling attributes of sensory signals (e.g. vision, hearing) is important for human-like perception and reasoning. A key approach is to represent the attributes as high-dimensional holographic vectors and then factorize the sensory input into these constituent vectors. However, this factorization process involves iterative computation of matrix-vector multiplications, which is expensive, suffers from non-convergence issues, and lacks scalability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes H3DFact, the first heterogeneous 3D (H3D) integrated accelerator that performs efficient and scalable factorization of high-dimensional holographic vectors. H3DFact consists of 3 vertically stacked tiers - an analog RRAM computation tier for matrix-vector multiplications, a digital peripheral circuits/SRAM tier, and a digital logic tier. 

Key Contributions:

1) H3DFact architecture that maps different computational kernels of the factorization workflow onto appropriate RRAM and digital SRAM tiers stacked vertically.

2) A hybrid memory design combining RRAM arrays in 40nm node for efficient analog computation-in-memory with peripheral circuits and SRAMs in advanced 16nm node.  

3) Leveraging the intrinsic stochasticity of RRAM devices to enhance factorization accuracy and break free of limit cycles.

Results:
Compared to 2D CMOS baselines, H3DFact improves factorization accuracy from 10.8% to 99.2% for large vector dimensions, reduces silicon footprint by 5.9x and increases compute density by 5.5x. It also demonstrates superior energy efficiency and matches the accuracy of deterministic designs by virtue of its inherent stochasticity.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of H3DFact, the first heterogeneous 3D (H3D) integrated compute-in-memory (CIM) factorizer for efficient and scalable factorization of high-dimensional holographic vector representations. Specifically, H3DFact features:

- A hybrid memory design that integrates analog RRAM computation components (in a 40nm node) with digital SRAM components (in a 16nm node) in a 3D stacked configuration. 

- Exploiting the computation-in-superposition capability of holographic vectors and the intrinsic stochasticity of memristive devices to enhance factorization accuracy and operational capacity.

- Demonstrated 5.5x higher compute density, 1.2x better energy efficiency, 5.9x smaller silicon footprint compared to 2D baseline designs with the same computing resources.

- Improved factorization accuracy (99.3%) and operational capacity by 5 orders of magnitude on large-scale problems compared to baseline resonator networks.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of H3DFact as the first H3D CIM factorizer for efficient high-dimensional holographic factorization leveraging emerging memristive technologies.
