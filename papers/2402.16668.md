# [Program-Based Strategy Induction for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classic reinforcement learning (RL) models assume agents incrementally estimate expected rewards. But humans and animals often use more discrete, idiosyncratic, and explicit heuristics or strategies. 
- Recent work using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for strategy discovery can generate complex strategies, but they are difficult to interpret and may not represent the most appropriate strategy space.

Proposed Solution:
- Use Bayesian program induction to discover interpretable program-structured strategies that trade off between simplicity and effectiveness. 
- Model strategies as programs with separate state update and policy functions. Search using a generative prior and likelihood based on strategy performance.
- Explore resulting strategies in bandit tasks to account for behavioral phenomena difficult for classic RL.

Key Contributions:
- Framework can identify asymmetric learning from only rewards, resembling animal behavior. A bias toward only positive feedback can be rational.
- Adaptive random exploration emerges from discovered stochastic accumulator strategy. Horizon-specific inverse temps balance representation cost and memory dynamics.  
- Switches between discrete decision states for exploration and exploitation resemble proposals based on animal neural data.

The paper introduces a novel Bayesian program induction approach for discovering interpretable and resource-rational strategies. It shows this framework can identify behavioral features in bandit tasks that are challenging for standard RL models, providing a new tool for gaining computational-level insights about learning and decision making strategies.
