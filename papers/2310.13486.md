# [Mind the instructions: a holistic evaluation of consistency and   interactions in prompt-based learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) for language models is gaining popularity over traditional task tuning, but ICL models are less stable and reliable on benchmarks. 
- Many factors like prompt order, label distribution, etc. influence ICL model predictions, but their interactions are not well understood.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a systematic evaluation across combinations of factors to analyze main effects and interactions in ICL setups.
- Use regression and ANOVA to quantitatively assess impact of factors like model scale, tuning, number of shots, etc. on accuracy and consistency.

Key Findings:
- ICL models are much less sensitive to spurious input-label correlations than task-tuned models. However other factors have more influence.
- Instruction phrasing has by far the most significant impact on predictions. It also interacts the most with other factors, making it the most pivotal factor.  
- Number of shots, label balancing have small, non-interactive effects. Model scale and instruction tuning improve robustness.
- Takeaway: Instructions are vital in ICL and warrant more research. Simple prompt factors like shots can be configured reliably.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of interactions between a wide range of factors in few-shot learning setups.
- Actionable guidelines on prompt factors - which ones can be used freely vs. which need more care.
- Demonstrates relative robustness of ICL models to spurious correlations, compared to task tuning.
- Shows instructions are most influential but also most volatile factor.

In summary, the paper significantly advances our understanding of reliability and interactions of different factors in prompt-based learning, using a principled experimental methodology.
