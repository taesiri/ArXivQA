# [FH-SSTNet: Forehead Creases based User Verification using Spatio-Spatial   Temporal Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16202)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional biometric traits like face, iris, etc. can be obscured by masks and other accessories, limiting their utility. Soft biometric traits like forehead creases offer alternatives.
- Prior work on using forehead creases is limited. Existing methods have constraints like complex capture setups or lack optimizations for mobile use cases.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using forehead creases as a biometric trait for user verification, especially when traditional traits are obscured.
- It introduces FH-SSTNet - a 3D CNN architecture to capture discriminative spatio-temporal features from forehead images.
- Input forehead images are divided into overlapping patches and stacked sequentially to introduce a temporal dimension. 
- The backbone network extracts features using 3D conv layers and triplet loss. The head network further processes features using FC layers and ArcFace loss.

Main Contributions:
- First study to learn spatio-temporal features from forehead creases for user verification.
- Proposes FH-SSTNet, a custom 3D CNN architecture to extract distinctive spatio-temporal features robust to variations.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on Forehead Creases V1 dataset, with 1.77% Equal Error Rate. Outperforms existing methods.

In summary, the paper pioneers forehead creases as a novel biometric trait and presents an optimized 3D CNN solution to effectively match them for user verification, especially in masked scenarios where traditional biometrics falter. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.
