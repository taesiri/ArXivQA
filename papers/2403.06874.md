# [COOD: Combined out-of-distribution detection using multiple measures for   anomaly &amp; novel class detection in large-scale hierarchical classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- High-performing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, including both anomaly and novel class detection, is important for real-world use of image classification models. 
- Prior OOD detection methods are typically benchmarked on small datasets with OOD data from entirely different domains. Different OOD measures can perform well on some OOD datasets but not others.
- This paper focuses on large-scale biodiversity datasets with challenges like hierarchical classes, severe class imbalance, varying image quality. Encountering novel species is common so OOD detection is critical.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a framework, Combined OOD (COOD), that combines multiple existing and several new OOD measures into one score using a supervised model (Random Forest classifier).
- New OOD measures exploit hierarchical class structure and discrepancy between linear and kNN predictions.
- Explicitly define in-distribution images incorrectly classified by the original model, split into high-confidence wrong predictions and others. Important for model training/evaluation.

Main Contributions:  
- COOD significantly outperforms individual OOD measures, improving detection of ImageNet images from 54.3% to 85.4% for an iNaturalist dataset.
- Different OOD measures are critical for different OOD detection tasks per SHAP analysis. Multiple measures needed to generalize.
- Show importance of explicitly handling in-distribution but incorrectly classified images for consistent analysis and real-world use.
- Framework is extensible with additional existing or new OOD measures to overcome limitations. Evaluated on large-scale biodiversity datasets focused on species recognition from images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework (COOD) for combining multiple out-of-distribution detection measures into one score to improve anomaly and novel class detection, and shows significantly improved performance over individual measures on three large-scale biodiversity image classification datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) COOD - a novel framework that combines existing and novel out-of-distribution (OOD) measures into one combined OOD score. Extensive evaluation shows this improves OOD detection performance on three biodiversity datasets compared to individual OOD measures.

2) Several novel OOD measures focused on exploiting hierarchical class labels and detecting novel classes. Specifically, measures based on the discrepancy between linear and kNN predictions are introduced.

3) Showing that explicitly defining how to deal with in-distribution but incorrectly classified images is important for consistent analysis and practical application of OOD detection methods. The paper categorizes these images and uses them in model training and evaluation.

So in summary, the main contribution is the COOD framework for combining multiple OOD measures, along with the introduction of new OOD measures and an analysis of how to handle incorrectly classified in-distribution images. The overall goal is to improve OOD detection, especially for challenging real-world application areas like biodiversity image classification.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework called COOD that combines multiple individual OOD measures into one score. What is the rationale behind combining multiple measures instead of developing a single best-performing measure? How does this enable the framework to work well across different datasets and tasks?

2. Several novel OOD measures are introduced, especially the ones exploiting hierarchical label structure and discrepancy between linear and kNN predictions. Explain these measures and the intuition behind why they help in OOD detection, especially for novel classes. 

3. The paper evaluates performance on both anomaly and novel class detection across 3 different biodiversity datasets. What are the key properties and challenges of these datasets? How do the results demonstrate the versatility of COOD?

4. Supervised learning is used to train the COOD classifier combining the individual measures. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this compared to unsupervised methods? How does access to external OOD datasets help?

5. The paper explicitly deals with images incorrectly classified by the original classifier. Why is this an important practical consideration for OOD detection systems? How are these images categorized and handled in COOD?

6. SHAP analysis is used to analyze feature importance of the combined COOD models. What key insights do the SHAP plots provide regarding the individual measures? How does this support the concept of combining multiple weak measures?

7. Several parameters could be optimized in the COOD framework like k for kNN, choice of classifier, adding more measures etc. Suggest ways these could be studied systematically to improve performance further.

8. The biodiversity datasets pose specific challenges like class hierarchy, label noise, domain overlap etc. How could the framework be adapted for OOD detection in other applications like autonomous vehicles, medicine etc?

9. The paper focuses on image data. Could the COOD framework work for other modalities like text, time-series data? What components would need to change?

10. How useful is COOD for interactive applications helping users take better pictures or finding novel classes reliably? Provide some examples of how the output categories could guide user interactions.
