# [QKFormer: Hierarchical Spiking Transformer using Q-K Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16552)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing spiking transformers suffer from two main issues: 1) The spike-form self-attention used in previous works has quadratic complexity to the number of tokens, making it difficult to explore hierarchical architectures. 2) Previous spiking transformers use straight-through structures without hierarchical representation. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel spiking transformer called QKFormer with the following innovations:

1. A spike-form Q-K attention mechanism that has linear complexity and models the importance of tokens/channels through binary vectors. It uses two components: Query (Q) and Key (K).

2. A Patch Embedding module with Deformed Shortcut (PEDS) that enhances information transmission in spiking transformers.

3. A hierarchical architecture that produces multi-scale spiking representations, starting from small patches and gradually merging neighboring patches in deeper layers. This is enabled by the efficient Q-K attention.

Main Contributions:

1. The Q-K attention mechanism that has much lower complexity than prior spike-form attentions, making hierarchical architectures feasible.

2. The design of the PEDS module that brings significant performance gains. 

3. QKFormer - the first hierarchical spiking transformer that produces multi-scale spiking representations through the proposed Q-K attention and PEDS.

4. State-of-the-art results on ImageNet, CIFAR, and neuromorphic datasets. Notably, QKFormer exceeds 85% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for the first time among directly trained SNNs.

In summary, this paper makes spiking transformers more powerful through novel spike-form attention and architectures, achieving new milestones for event-driven models on complex vision tasks. The innovations pave the way for deploying spiking neural networks to low-power hardware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer for direct training of spiking neural networks, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet image classification through a novel spike-based Q-K attention mechanism and a versatile patch embedding module with deformed shortcuts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism tailored for spiking neural networks (SNNs), which can efficiently model the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity.

2. Designing a versatile and powerful Patch Embedding module with a Deformed Shortcut (PEDS), which enhances spiking information transmission and improves the performance of spiking transformers. 

3. Developing a hierarchical spiking transformer based on the proposed Q-K attention and PEDS, named QKFormer, which marks the effective exploration of hierarchical spiking representation in Transformer-based SNNs. 

4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple static and neuromorphic datasets using the proposed QKFormer model. Notably, QKFormer surpassed 85% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 4 time steps using direct training, which is the first time for an SNN model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing innovations including the Q-K attention, the PEDS module, and the hierarchical QKFormer architecture to substantially improve the performance of Transformer-based SNNs. The proposed QKFormer model achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple mainstream vision datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism. How does this attention mechanism efficiently model the importance of token or channel dimensions? What is the time and space complexity compared to previous attention mechanisms like vanilla self-attention and spiking self-attention?

2. The paper introduces a hierarchical architecture for the spiking transformer, named QKFormer, to obtain multi-scale spiking representations. Why is a hierarchical architecture beneficial for SNNs and transformer models? How does QKFormer specifically implement the hierarchical architecture with its token downsampling strategy? 

3. The paper designs a Patch Embedding module with Deformed Shortcut (PEDS) for the spiking transformer. What is the intuition behind this module? How does PEDS enhance information transmission in the spiking transformer models? What variations of PEDS are possible?

4. The paper shows state-of-the-art performance of QKFormer on ImageNet, surpassing 85% top-1 accuracy which is a first for directly trained SNNs. What contributes to this significant performance improvement - is it mostly attributed to the Q-K attention, the hierarchical architecture, the training techniques or a combination? 

5. How does the spike firing rate pattern across QKFormer blocks evolve through the hierarchical architecture? What differences can be observed between early and late QKFormer blocks and how can we interpret those?

6. The paper adopts a Leaky-Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model. How sensitive is QKFormer performance to the choice of spiking neuron model? Have the authors experimented with other spiking neuron options like IF neurons, PLIF neurons etc?

7. The paper demonstrates robust performance of QKFormer down to just 1 simulation timestep. However, performance generally improves with more timesteps. What is the tradeoff between accuracy and latency by varying timesteps? What range of timesteps is practical?  

8. What are the limitations of the current QKFormer model? What improvements can be incorporated - possibilities like incorporating learned priors as in prior works, using different training objectives like task-agnostic prediction loss etc.

9. The paper focuses on demonstrate QKFormer for image recognition. What would be interesting directions to scale QKFormer - like adapting it speech or language domains? What modifications maybe needed?

10. The paper proposes direct training of the spiking transformer model. How do the techniques compare against alternating training-conversion pipelines for SNNs? What are the relative pros and cons and what future work would help bridge the gap?
