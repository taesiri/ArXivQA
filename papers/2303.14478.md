# [DBARF: Deep Bundle-Adjusting Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14478)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we jointly optimize camera poses along with generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs) in an end-to-end manner, without requiring known camera poses like previous methods?

The key points are:

- Existing methods like BARF can jointly optimize camera poses with per-scene optimized NeRFs, but cannot work with GeNeRFs which are generalizable across scenes. 

- The authors analyze the difficulties of bundle adjusting (optimizing camera poses via bundle adjustment) with GeNeRFs. Issues like feature outliers and non-smooth cost functions make this challenging.

- They propose a method called DBARF that can jointly optimize camera poses and GeNeRF in an end-to-end manner, without requiring known poses. It uses a deep pose optimizer based on cost feature maps.

- Experiments show DBARF can generalize across scenes and outperform BARF/GARF without per-scene finetuning. It also produces better results than IBRNet on some scenes, even though IBRNet uses known poses.

So in summary, the key research question is how to jointly optimize poses and GeNeRFs in an end-to-end generalizable manner, which their proposed DBARF method aims to address. The hypothesis is that their approach can outperform prior pose optimization methods that work only with per-scene NeRFs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It analyzes the difficulties of bundle adjusting generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs), where existing methods like BARF and its variants cannot work well. 

2. It proposes a new method called DBARF that can jointly optimize the camera poses with GeNeRFs in an end-to-end manner without requiring known absolute camera poses. 

3. DBARF constructs a cost feature map by warping features from nearby views to the target view. This cost map serves as an implicit objective for a neural pose optimizer to recurrently refine the relative camera poses.

4. Experiments show DBARF can generalize across scenes for novel view synthesis and does not need good initialization of camera poses, unlike previous methods like BARF/GARF that require per-scene optimization and accurate initialization.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a deep neural approach DBARF to jointly optimize and generalize camera poses across scenes for GeNeRFs, circumventing limitations of prior pose optimization methods. The end-to-end training framework without ground truth poses is also novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes DBARF, a method to jointly optimize camera poses and a generalizable neural radiance field (GeNeRF) in a self-supervised manner without requiring known camera poses, in contrast to prior work like BARF that can only optimize per-scene NeRFs and relies on good pose initialization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on generalizable neural radiance fields (NeRFs):

- Most prior work on making NeRFs generalizable across scenes relies on known camera poses. In contrast, this paper proposes a method (DBARF) to jointly optimize camera poses together with a generalizable NeRF in a self-supervised manner without ground truth poses.

- Methods like BARF and GARF can optimize NeRFs jointly with camera poses, but require per-scene optimization and good pose initialization. The proposed DBARF approach is trained in a generalizable manner and does not need pose initialization.

- While concurrent work like G-NeRF also tackles generalizable pose optimization with NeRFs, it focuses on single view rendering. This paper tackles the more challenging multi-view case.

- Many recent generalizable NeRF works aggregate features across views using transformers or CNNs. The proposed approach uses an implicit residual feature map and deep pose optimizer, allowing joint optimization with such complex NeRF architectures.

- Experiments demonstrate DBARF's generalization ability and that it outperforms BARF/GARF without per-scene fine-tuning. It also achieves better rendering than a strong generalizable NeRF baseline with inaccurate poses.

Overall, this paper presents an innovative approach to jointly optimizing generalizable NeRFs and poses in a self-supervised manner, removing key limitations of prior works. The experiments demonstrate promising performance and generalization capabilities on challenging real-world datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the generalizability and robustness of the method to handle more complex scenes with less constraint on camera motions and lighting conditions. The current method focuses on forward-facing scenes with relatively simple lighting.

- Extending the approach to jointly optimize both intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. The method currently only estimates extrinsic camera poses. 

- Applying the framework to other generalizable neural radiance field methods besides IBRNet to demonstrate broader applicability.

- Incorporating explicit geometry reasoning, e.g. through differentiable rendering, to potentially improve accuracy and reduce artifacts. 

- Exploring the use of transformer networks as an alternative architecture choice to CNNs for both the radiance field and pose optimization components.

- Leveraging additional self-supervision signals like view synthesis from videos to improve depth prediction and handling of moving objects/dynamic scenes.

- Developing theoretical analysis to provide better insight into properties of the cost function landscape and optimization process.

- Testing on large-scale real-world datasets to evaluate robustness and scalability.

In summary, the main future directions aim to expand the applicability, accuracy and robustness of the deep bundle adjustment approach, integrate more advanced network architectures, improve generalization, and perform more extensive experimental validation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a method called DBARF for jointly optimizing camera poses and generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs). GeNeRFs require extracting image features, often using 3D CNNs or transformers, rather than just coordinate-based MLPs like the original NeRF. The authors first analyze why it is difficult to directly optimize camera poses with GeNeRFs via gradient descent, identifying two main issues - aggregated outlier features due to occlusions, and non-smooth cost functions. 

To address these issues, the authors propose the DBARF framework. It uses a recurrent neural network to take an implicit cost map as input and iteratively predict relative camera pose corrections from a target view to nearby views. The cost map is constructed by warping features from the target view to nearby views using the current predicted poses. DBARF is jointly trained end-to-end with a GeNeRF using view reconstruction loss, without requiring known camera poses. Experiments demonstrate DBARF's effectiveness for novel view synthesis and pose accuracy. Unlike previous pose optimization methods, DBARF generalizes across scenes without per-scene fine-tuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a deep bundle-adjusting neural radiance field (DBARF) method that can jointly optimize camera poses and generalizable neural radiance fields without requiring known absolute camera poses. The key points are:

- Generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs) rely on accurate camera poses. Jointly optimizing poses with gradient descent fails even with good initializations. The paper analyzes two potential reasons: aggregated feature outliers due to occlusions and non-smooth cost maps from ResNet features.

- DBARF implicitly minimizes the feature consistency loss using a deep pose optimizer. It samples image patches to construct a cost map measuring feature differences between a target view and nearby views. A recurrent GRU predicts relative pose corrections by taking the cost map as input. 

- DBARF is trained end-to-end without ground truth poses. The pose optimizer and GeNeRF are jointly trained with losses for pose optimization (warped photometric loss) and novel view synthesis (RGB loss). Experiments show it outperforms existing pose optimization methods for NeRFs.

In summary, DBARF proposes a deep implicit optimization approach to jointly optimize poses and generalizable radiance fields in a self-supervised manner, achieving better generalization than prior pose refinement methods. The key novelty is the deep pose optimizer that minimizes feature consistency loss using cost maps.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of jointly optimizing camera poses with generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs). Specifically:

- Recent works like BARF and GARF can bundle adjust camera poses with coordinate MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRFs). However, these methods cannot be applied to GeNeRFs, which typically use more complex 3D CNN or transformer architectures rather than simple coordinate MLPs. 

- Jointly optimizing camera poses with GeNeRFs is non-trivial. The paper analyzes two potential issues - aggregated outlier features due to occlusions, and high non-convexity of the cost function from ResNet features. 

- Existing pose optimization methods like BARF require accurate initial poses and per-scene optimization. The goal is to develop a pose optimization method that works with GeNeRFs, does not need good initialization, and can generalize across scenes.

To address this, the paper proposes DBARF - a method to jointly optimize camera poses and GeNeRFs without requiring ground truth poses. Key ideas include:

- Using a cost feature map between target and nearby views as an implicit optimization objective.

- Adopting a recurrent pose optimizer network to predict relative pose corrections based on the cost map.

- Jointly training the pose optimizer and GeNeRF in a self-supervised manner on real datasets.

In summary, the key problem is enabling joint optimization of GeNeRFs and camera poses without needing accurate initialization or per-scene training, which existing methods cannot address. The proposed DBARF method aims to solve this problem.
