# [DBARF: Deep Bundle-Adjusting Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14478)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we jointly optimize camera poses along with generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs) in an end-to-end manner, without requiring known camera poses like previous methods?

The key points are:

- Existing methods like BARF can jointly optimize camera poses with per-scene optimized NeRFs, but cannot work with GeNeRFs which are generalizable across scenes. 

- The authors analyze the difficulties of bundle adjusting (optimizing camera poses via bundle adjustment) with GeNeRFs. Issues like feature outliers and non-smooth cost functions make this challenging.

- They propose a method called DBARF that can jointly optimize camera poses and GeNeRF in an end-to-end manner, without requiring known poses. It uses a deep pose optimizer based on cost feature maps.

- Experiments show DBARF can generalize across scenes and outperform BARF/GARF without per-scene finetuning. It also produces better results than IBRNet on some scenes, even though IBRNet uses known poses.

So in summary, the key research question is how to jointly optimize poses and GeNeRFs in an end-to-end generalizable manner, which their proposed DBARF method aims to address. The hypothesis is that their approach can outperform prior pose optimization methods that work only with per-scene NeRFs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It analyzes the difficulties of bundle adjusting generalizable neural radiance fields (GeNeRFs), where existing methods like BARF and its variants cannot work well. 

2. It proposes a new method called DBARF that can jointly optimize the camera poses with GeNeRFs in an end-to-end manner without requiring known absolute camera poses. 

3. DBARF constructs a cost feature map by warping features from nearby views to the target view. This cost map serves as an implicit objective for a neural pose optimizer to recurrently refine the relative camera poses.

4. Experiments show DBARF can generalize across scenes for novel view synthesis and does not need good initialization of camera poses, unlike previous methods like BARF/GARF that require per-scene optimization and accurate initialization.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a deep neural approach DBARF to jointly optimize and generalize camera poses across scenes for GeNeRFs, circumventing limitations of prior pose optimization methods. The end-to-end training framework without ground truth poses is also novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes DBARF, a method to jointly optimize camera poses and a generalizable neural radiance field (GeNeRF) in a self-supervised manner without requiring known camera poses, in contrast to prior work like BARF that can only optimize per-scene NeRFs and relies on good pose initialization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on generalizable neural radiance fields (NeRFs):

- Most prior work on making NeRFs generalizable across scenes relies on known camera poses. In contrast, this paper proposes a method (DBARF) to jointly optimize camera poses together with a generalizable NeRF in a self-supervised manner without ground truth poses.

- Methods like BARF and GARF can optimize NeRFs jointly with camera poses, but require per-scene optimization and good pose initialization. The proposed DBARF approach is trained in a generalizable manner and does not need pose initialization.

- While concurrent work like G-NeRF also tackles generalizable pose optimization with NeRFs, it focuses on single view rendering. This paper tackles the more challenging multi-view case.

- Many recent generalizable NeRF works aggregate features across views using transformers or CNNs. The proposed approach uses an implicit residual feature map and deep pose optimizer, allowing joint optimization with such complex NeRF architectures.

- Experiments demonstrate DBARF's generalization ability and that it outperforms BARF/GARF without per-scene fine-tuning. It also achieves better rendering than a strong generalizable NeRF baseline with inaccurate poses.

Overall, this paper presents an innovative approach to jointly optimizing generalizable NeRFs and poses in a self-supervised manner, removing key limitations of prior works. The experiments demonstrate promising performance and generalization capabilities on challenging real-world datasets.
