# [Enhancing Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models through   Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) trained on multilingual data still lag behind in most languages compared to resource-rich languages like English due to imbalanced data distribution. 
- Existing methods like translate-then-fine-tune have limitations in improving multilingual performance while retaining capabilities in resource-rich languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a method called Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages (SDRRL) to enhance LLM multilingual capabilities.
- Leverage LLM's strong capabilities in resource-rich languages by having it generate high-quality responses as extra supervision signal.
- Translate resource-rich responses into other languages to construct transfer set for sentence-level knowledge distillation.
- Incorporate small external parallel corpus to align representations and improve multilingual generation.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel distillation method SDRRL that uses LLM's own responses in resource-rich languages as extra supervision signal.
- Conduct comprehensive experiments on LLaMA and SeaLLM covering 16 languages on comprehension and generation tasks.
- Show SDRRL significantly improves target language performance while maintaining capabilities in resource-rich languages.  
- Demonstrate generalizability to multiple LLM models and source languages (English and French).
- Provide analysis showing SDRRL helps align multilingual representations and alleviate issues like off-target responses.

In summary, the key innovation is leveraging resource-rich language capabilities within an LLM itself to enhance its multilingual performance through self-distillation, instead of solely relying on external translation. Experiments and analysis demonstrate clear improvements in LLM multilingual abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages (SDRRL) that enhances the multilingual capabilities of large language models by leveraging their strong performance in high-resource languages like English to align and improve other target languages through knowledge distillation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method called "Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages (SDRRL)" to enhance the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- SDRRL leverages the strong capabilities of LLMs in resource-rich languages like English to improve performance in other target languages. It uses the LLM's own responses in English as additional supervision signals to distill knowledge into other languages.

- The key idea is to collect English responses from the LLM on a dataset, translate them (and the original questions) into the target languages using machine translation, and use these "question-answer" pairs to continue training the LLM on the target languages. 

- This allows aligning the representation spaces of target languages with that of English, thereby transferring capabilities from the resource-rich language. It is shown to significantly enhance performance on comprehension and generation tasks across 14 languages.

- Compared to prior work on translate-then-fine-tune or cross-lingual transfer learning, SDRRL is more effective in improving multilingual performance while preserving capabilities in high-resource source languages like English.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of the SDRRL method to transfer knowledge from resource-rich languages for enhancing multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

The paper proposes a method called "Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages" (SDRRL) to improve the multilingual capabilities of large language models. The key ideas involve using the models' own high-quality responses in resource-rich languages like English as extra supervision signals, translating them to align other languages, addressing off-target generation issues, and evaluating the approach comprehensively on tasks like comprehension, translation, summarization and question answering. So those would be some of the central concepts associated with this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does SDRRL leverage the internal capabilities of LLMs on resource-rich languages to enhance multilingual performance? What are the key ideas behind using self-distillation for this purpose?

2. Why is directly using translated training data not always effective for enhancing multilingual capabilities? What are some of the challenges with the translate-then-SFT approach that SDRRL aims to address?  

3. What are the different components of the transfer set constructed in SDRRL and what is the purpose of each? How does the diversity in language combinations aid cross-linguistic learning?

4. How does SDRRL align representation spaces of different languages? What visualizations or analyses demonstrate improved multilingual representations after applying SDRRL?

5. What is the purpose of using code-switching in SDRRL? How does it provide additional alignment at the token level? What parameters were used for code-switching?

6. Why does SDRRL incorporate additional external parallel corpus through machine translation and sentence completion instructions? How does this regularization mechanism mitigate issues caused by noisy machine translations?

7. What ablation studies were performed to validate the necessity of different components of SDRRL? Which aspects contribute most significantly to performance gains from SDRRL?

8. How effective is SDRRL in preserving capabilities in the original resource-rich languages? Does effectiveness vary across language families and writing systems?

9. Can SDRRL leverage non-English resource-rich source languages? What experiments validate its applicability beyond English as the source language? How do gains compare to English?

10. What case studies and visualizations provide insights into how SDRRL enhances multilingual generation capabilities? How does it alleviate issues like off-target responses, grammatical errors and hallucinations?
