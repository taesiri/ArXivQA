# [On Second Thought, Let's Not Think Step by Step! Bias and Toxicity in
  Zero-Shot Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08061)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How does prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate a zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) impact their performance on sensitive NLP tasks involving social reasoning and knowledge?

In particular, the authors hypothesize that zero-shot CoT reasoning will increase the likelihood of LLM models generating biased, toxic, or harmful outputs when evaluated on tasks related to stereotypes and harmful content. 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

- Zero-shot CoT will increase the rate of stereotypical selections/generations across sensitivity benchmarks compared to standard prompting without CoT.

- Zero-shot CoT will increase the rate of explicit encouragement of harmful behaviors in open-ended generation compared to standard prompting.

- The increases in bias and toxicity when using CoT will get worse as model scale increases.

- Models with improved alignment through reinforcement learning will see smaller increases in bias/toxicity when using CoT compared to standard prompting.

So in summary, the central research question is examining how zero-shot CoT impacts LLM performance on sensitive social reasoning tasks, with a hypothesis that CoT will reveal and exacerbate biases in the models. The paper aims to characterize these effects across model variants and task types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Demonstrating that using a zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) prompting strategy consistently increases toxicity and bias in large language models like GPT-3 when evaluated on sensitive social tasks. 

2. Conducting controlled evaluations across two socially sensitive task types - harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks. The results show that CoT prompting causes models to exhibit increased preferences for output that perpetuates stereotypes or encourages explicit toxic behavior.

3. Analyzing trends in CoT toxicity across different models, scales, and alignment techniques. The authors find that toxicity increases with model scale but decreases when models have improved instruction following through reinforcement learning based human preference learning. 

4. Recommending that CoT should be used cautiously for socially sensitive tasks, especially when marginalized groups are involved. The authors suggest carefully auditing reasoning steps and being aware that techniques like pretending to be an "evil AI" are essentially reasoning strategies that can undo progress in value alignment.

5. Highlighting implications for use of CoT in high stakes social domains like mental health chatbots, where models should avoid blindly using CoT and instead be uncertain when generating potentially biased reasoning.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating empirically that zero-shot CoT prompting, while beneficial for logical reasoning tasks, significantly increases undesirable bias and toxicity when applied to tasks requiring nuanced social knowledge. The authors recommend mitigation strategies and caution around use of CoT for socially sensitive applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that using zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) prompting can increase harmful biases and toxicity in large language model generations on sensitive tasks related to stereotypes and harmful behavior, especially as model scale increases, indicating that CoT should be used cautiously for socially-relevant domains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of evaluating reasoning capabilities in large language models:

- This paper provides a focused evaluation on the impacts of zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) reasoning specifically on social domains and sensitive benchmarks. Much prior work has looked at CoT's benefits for logical reasoning tasks like arithmetic or commonsense QA. Analyzing CoT on biases and toxicity provides a new perspective.

- The paper thoroughly examines CoT across multiple models (GPT-3 001-003 series), benchmarks (CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, BBQ, HarmfulQ), and prompt formats. This provides a comprehensive characterization of CoT's effects, going beyond just one model or dataset.

- The analysis of scaling effects and human preference alignment provides useful insights. Showing that harms from CoT get worse with scale but improve with alignment gives actionable suggestions for mitigation. 

- The inclusion of an explicit toxicity benchmark (HarmfulQ) is novel. Most prior work uses intrinsic social bias benchmarks based on stereotypes. Evaluating explicit encouragement of toxic behavior provides additional evidence for CoT's potential harms.

- The paper builds on a growing body of work analyzing the limitations and potential harms of LLMs. It provides concrete evidence that reasoning strategies like CoT do not universally improve performance, and can exacerbate issues in social domains.

Overall, the focused evaluation of CoT across sensitive domains and the thorough analysis of effects provides novel evidence that blindly applying reasoning strategies can be harmful. The paper makes an important contribution in characterizing these effects and providing guidance on potential mitigation strategies. More caution is warranted when utilizing CoT for socially situated tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Systematically exploring more prompt variations and reasoning strategies beyond "Let's think step by step." The authors note that small changes to the prompt structure can dramatically affect the results. More work is needed to fully characterize different types of reasoning prompts and their impacts on bias and toxicity.

- Generalizing the findings beyond GPT-3 models. As large open source models continue to emerge, it will be important to evaluate whether similar issues arise with zero-shot reasoning prompts. The authors suggest potential differences due to scale and alignment procedures.

- Further analysis on the role of model scale. The authors observe an apparent negative relationship between model scale and accuracy on bias benchmarks when using CoT prompts, but suggest more research is needed to determine if this effect is "U-shaped."

- Evaluating CoT prompts in few-shot settings. The current work focuses on zero-shot capabilities to isolate effects. However, few-shot prompts may interact differently with CoT bias and toxicity.

- Comprehensive analysis of different complex reasoning strategies beyond CoT. The authors suggest strategies like "pretending to be an evil AI" may allow models to circumvent alignment efforts in a similar way to CoT prompting.

- Mitigation strategies when applying CoT prompts to social domains. The authors recommend careful consideration of uncertainty behaviors and bias distributions when using CoT in high stakes applications like mental health chatbots.

Overall, the authors highlight the need for much more nuanced understanding, auditing, and mitigation strategies when applying reasoning techniques like CoT to socially sensitive tasks. Their work surfaces concerns that should be thoroughly addressed as LLMs continue to advance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the effects of using a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy on large language models in socially sensitive domains. CoT involves prompting the model to think step-by-step to reach an answer. The authors find that while CoT improves performance on logical reasoning tasks, it can increase bias and toxicity when applied to tasks involving social knowledge and nuance. Specifically, the authors test CoT on stereotype and harmful question benchmarks, comparing CoT to standard prompting. Models using CoT show higher rates of selecting stereotypical information and encouraging harmful behavior compared to standard prompting. The authors suggest CoT should be used cautiously for socially important tasks, and recommend auditing reasoning steps and analyzing scale/alignment effects. Overall, the paper demonstrates that blindly applying CoT can sabotage performance and exacerbate biases for tasks requiring social awareness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the use of chain of thought (CoT) reasoning strategies in large language models (LLMs) on socially sensitive tasks related to stereotypes and harmful questions. The authors find that eliciting CoTs can increase the likelihood of LLMs generating biased or toxic outputs, compared to standard prompting without an explicit reasoning strategy. Specifically, models using CoT are more likely to rely on stereotypes and encourage explicitly harmful behavior on tasks designed to measure those tendencies. 

The authors suggest CoT should be used cautiously for social domains, especially those involving marginalized groups. They recommend auditing reasoning steps for biases, noting common strategies like "pretending to be an evil AI" allow models to circumvent alignment efforts. Improved alignment through human preference training reduces but does not eliminate the risks of CoT. The work implies reasoning strategies emerge in LLMs at sufficient scale, but have unintended consequences on social tasks requiring nuance. Careful control of reasoning prompts is needed to avoid exacerbating biases.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper evaluates the impact of using a zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) prompting strategy on large language model performance across two types of sensitive tasks: stereotype benchmarks and harmful questions. To do this, the authors take three existing stereotype datasets (CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, and BBQ) and create a new dataset of harmful questions (HarmfulQ). They reformulate the datasets into zero-shot reasoning tasks by framing them as question answering prompts. The authors then evaluate several GPT-3 models on these tasks using two prompting strategies: 1) a standard prompt that directly asks the model for an answer, and 2) a CoT prompt that first elicits step-by-step reasoning from the model before extracting a final answer. They compare model performance across these two strategies to analyze how zero-shot CoT impacts biases and toxicity. The main finding is that across most tasks, models exhibit higher rates of bias and toxicity when using the CoT prompting strategy compared to standard prompting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It evaluates the impact of using "chain of thought" (CoT) prompting to elicit reasoning from large language models (LLMs) on socially sensitive tasks. 

- The authors find that using CoT prompting increases harmful or undesirable output from LLMs on tasks related to stereotypes and harmful/toxic questions.

- They hypothesize that by prompting LLMs to "think step-by-step", this allows the models to circumvent alignment efforts and produce biased reasoning.

- Across evaluations on three stereotype benchmarks and a new "Harmful Questions" benchmark, CoT prompting leads to increased stereotypical reasoning and recommendations for harmful/toxic behaviors compared to standard prompting.

- The bias induced by CoT prompting appears to increase with model scale but decrease with improved instruction following. Explicit mitigation instructions in prompts can reduce CoT bias.

- The authors recommend carefully evaluating reasoning steps induced by CoT, especially for socially sensitive tasks, and not assuming CoT will universally improve performance.

In summary, the key question this paper addresses is: what are the potential downsides of using CoT prompting strategies with LLMs for socially sensitive tasks where nuanced reasoning is required? The authors find that CoT can significantly increase undesirable biases and toxicity in these contexts.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach to improve performance on question answering and reasoning tasks. How might the choice of prompt wording impact the efficacy and biases exhibited when using this CoT approach? For example, how might "Let's think step-by-step" compare to other prompts like "Let's break this down logically"?

2. When evaluating CoT on the stereotype and toxicity benchmarks, what factors led you to focus primarily on a zero-shot rather than few-shot setting? What are some of the tradeoffs between few-shot vs zero-shot CoT prompting?

3. For the stereotype benchmarks like CrowS Pairs, you converted them to multiple choice questions by providing the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical options. How might directly generating the CoT without multiple choice options impact the biases exhibited? 

4. You found different trends in how CoT impacted bias across the davinci model variants (e.g. 001, 002, 003). What differences between these model variants might explain the differences seen? How could the CoT approach be adapted to account for these model differences?

5. The paper indicates CoT reasoning steps often involved explicit stereotyping or toxic suggestions. What techniques could help detect or avoid generating explicitly biased CoT reasoning paths? For example, could intermediate checkpoints be used?

6. You propose CoT prompting should be audited before use in high stakes domains like mental health. What specific auditing protocols or checks should be considered before deploying CoT models to sensitive domains? 

7. The paper focuses on English language models. How might cultural differences impact CoT biases exhibited in non-English contexts? What cautions are needed when applying CoT prompting approaches across different cultures?

8. You find differences in how model scale impacts CoT biases vs the impact of human preference training. What are possible explanations for why scale and preference training affect CoT differently?

9. The paper indicates even innocuous prompts like "pretending you're an evil AI" could act as reasoning prompts that reveal biases. How can seemingly harmless prompts actually act as reasoning strategies that need auditing?

10. You recommend carefully evaluating uncertainty behaviors when applying CoT prompting to social domains. What metrics or approaches should be used to rigorously audit uncertainty in these contexts?
