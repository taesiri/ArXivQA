# [Exploiting Semantic Reconstruction to Mitigate Hallucinations in   Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16167)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem where they generate captions that are incorrect or inconsistent with the given image. Hallucinations undermine the reliability of VLMs, especially when generating long captions. Current methods for mitigating hallucinations rely on additional datasets and annotations, which are expensive. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes ESREAL, a novel unsupervised learning framework to mitigate hallucinations in VLMs by exploiting semantic reconstruction from captions.  

Key ideas:
- Reconstruct image from caption using text-to-image model 
- Align regions between original and reconstructed images 
- Identify hallucinated tokens by comparing aligned regions 
- Calculate token-level hallucination scores based on type
- Use scores to penalize hallucinated tokens via proximal policy optimization

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes ESREAL - a fully unsupervised hallucination mitigation framework that identifies and penalizes hallucinated tokens without extra annotated data
2) Crafts a reference-free hallucination detection pipeline utilizing semantic reconstruction to enable token-level identification of hallucinations
3) Demonstrates ESREAL's effectiveness in reducing hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP and mPLUG-Owl2 on CHAIR metric and FaithScore

The key novelty is the use of semantic reconstruction to enable detailed and unsupervised hallucination detection integrated into a policy learning framework to mitigate hallucinations in a wide range of VLMs. Experiments validate ESREAL's ability to reduce hallucinations while maintaining caption quality.
