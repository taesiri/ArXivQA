# [OceanPlan: Hierarchical Planning and Replanning for Natural Language AUV   Piloting in Large-scale Unexplored Ocean Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper aims to tackle the problem of efficiently grounding natural language commands into executable robotic plans to pilot autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for long-duration missions in large-scale, unexplored ocean environments. Key challenges include lack of localization systems underwater, limited prior knowledge of complex ocean terrain, and the need for energy-efficient planning over vast areas.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a hierarchical planning and replanning framework called OceanPlan that bridges abstract human commands to low-level AUV control actions. It has four main components:

1) An LLM planner that interprets commands and generates high-level plan heuristics to guide search 

2) An HTN symbolic task planner that creates feasible, executable plans to achieve goals

3) A Deep Q Network (DQN) motion planner that maps sensor observations to low-level controls 

4) A holistic replanner that evaluates execution and triggers re-planning at different levels to handle uncertainties

The framework decomposes complex missions hierarchically for efficiency while allowing replanning at multiple levels for robustness. Representations are grounded in physical observations.

Contributions:

The main contributions are:

1) An end-to-end framework for natural language AUV piloting using hierarchical LLM-task-motion planning and replanning 

2) Instantiation in a realistic marine simulator using detailed environment and robot models

3) Demonstrated efficiency from hierarchical decomposition and robust operation through multi-level replanning

4) Generalization over diverse ocean terrain by learning control policies from visual observations 

The experiments validate that the approach can effectively accomplish complex, long-horizon AUV missions on abstract commands.
