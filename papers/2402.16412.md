## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents TOTEM, a Tokenized Time Series Embedding Method for general time series analysis. The key idea is to learn a discrete, tokenized representation of time series data in a self-supervised manner using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE). This tokenized representation can then be used for various time series tasks like imputation, anomaly detection and forecasting with minimal tuning.

The paper highlights that most prior work in time series analysis uses specialist training, where models are trained on a single time series domain. In contrast, TOTEM explores generalist training where a single model is trained on multiple time series domains simultaneously. TOTEM's tokenizer architecture operates directly on the time steps with no data engineering and can handle varying dimensionality across examples, sensors and time steps. The VQVAE encodes a time series into discrete tokens through an encoder and quantizer, and decodes via a transposed convolutional decoder to reconstruct the original series. The codebook tokens are optimized via a commitment loss to enable end-to-end training.

For evaluation, TOTEM is tested on 17 real-world time series datasets across imputation, anomaly detection and forecasting tasks. Both specialist and generalist training regimes are explored and compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The results demonstrate that TOTEM matches or exceeds prior methods in several cases. Some key findings:

- In specialist imputation, TOTEM gets 52.1% best results across metrics and datasets. In generalist imputation, a single TOTEM model trained on multiple domains outperforms GPT-2 both in-domain and zero-shot.

- In anomaly detection, TOTEM gets 33.3% best specialist results and outperforms GPT-2 in generalist in-domain (80% vs 20%) and zero-shot (73.3% vs 26.7%).

- In forecasting, TOTEM gets 28.6% best specialist results across metrics, horizons and datasets. The generalist TOTEM also beats GPT-2 in-domain (67.9% vs 33.9%) and zero-shot (90% vs 12.5%).

In summary, the paper demonstrates that discrete, learnt representations enable effective generalist time series modeling across tasks. The tokenization approach matches or exceeds prior state-of-the-art with minimal tuning. Key future work includes dynamic token lengths and further analysis on model scale.
