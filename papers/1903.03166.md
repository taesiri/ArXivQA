# [CLEVR-Dialog: A Diagnostic Dataset for Multi-Round Reasoning in Visual   Dialog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03166)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seems to address is:

How can we construct a large-scale, fully annotated, diagnostic dataset for studying multi-round reasoning and visual coreference resolution in visually-grounded dialog?

The key aspects related to this research question are:

- Existing large-scale visual dialog datasets (like VisDial) are collected on real images, making it hard to extensively annotate the state of images/dialogs and study sub-tasks like coreference resolution in isolation.

- The authors develop a new dataset called CLEVR-Dialog by combining:

(a) CLEVR rendered images which have full scene graph annotations by construction. 

(b) A dialog grammar grounded in these scene graphs to generate multi-round dialogs.

- This combination results in exhaustively annotated dialogs where the dialog state is fully known. This enables targeted analysis like evaluating visual coreference resolution as a function of coreference distance.

- The authors benchmark existing models on CLEVR-Dialog and perform novel analysis like assessing textual/visual grounding of the best model. Such analysis is only possible on their fully annotated diagnostic dataset.

In summary, the key research contribution is the construction of CLEVR-Dialog to enable in-depth analysis and diagnosis of visuo-linguistic reasoning in visual dialog, which is not possible on large real datasets due to lack of annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The development of CLEVR-Dialog, a new diagnostic dataset for studying multi-round reasoning in visually-grounded dialog. The key features of CLEVR-Dialog are:

- It is built by combining CLEVR images with exhaustive scene graph annotations with a dialog grammar grounded in those scene graphs. 

- It contains over 4 million fully-annotated question-answer pairs in 425K dialogs on 85K images.

- The dialogs are designed to require temporal/multi-round reasoning over the conversation history. 

2. Using CLEVR-Dialog to analyze visual dialog models, especially on the challenging task of visual coreference resolution. The authors show a breakdown of model performance based on coreference distance and question type. 

3. Providing strong baselines on CLEVR-Dialog by benchmarking several existing visual dialog models. The best performing model (CorefNMN) gets 68% accuracy.

4. Demonstrating diagnostic analyses enabled by the full annotations in CLEVR-Dialog, including both qualitative visualization and quantitative evaluation of textual/visual grounding for the CorefNMN model.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the new diagnostic CLEVR-Dialog dataset that allows in-depth analysis of reasoning and grounding in visual dialog models. The benchmarking of models and case studies demonstrate its utility.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new synthetic visual dialog dataset called CLEVR-Dialog that is generated from scene graphs and is fully annotated, allowing detailed analysis of multi-round reasoning and coreference resolution by dialog agents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visual dialog:

- The focus on creating a diagnostic dataset (CLEVR-Dialog) sets it apart from much prior work that utilized large-scale real image datasets like VisDial. By using synthetic images with full scene graph annotations, the authors can deeply analyze model performance on specific challenges like multi-round reasoning and visual coreference resolution. This kind of detailed analysis is not possible with messy, real-world datasets.

- The idea of viewing dialog as communication between an Answerer and Questioner agents is similar to some prior work like Das et al. 2017. However, the dialog grammar defined here with caption templates and question templates composed of intuitive primitives is novel and allows modular, expressive dialog generation.

- Benchmarking the performance of standard visual dialog models like Late Fusion, HRE, and Memory Networks provides useful baselines for future work. Evaluating neural module networks like NMN and CorefNMN is particularly relevant given their modeling of visual reasoning.

- Analyzing model accuracy as a function of question type and history dependency provides insights into model strengths/weaknesses that prior VisDial work did not. For instance, identifying that CorefNMN performs much worse on questions requiring multi-round reasoning versus standalone questions highlights opportunities for future improvement.

Overall, I would say this paper pushes forward visual dialog research through its rigorous diagnostic evaluation capabilities. The analysis insights uniquely enabled by CLEVR-Dialog will inform continued progress on the challenges inherent to this multimodal dialog task. The paper differs from prior work in its emphasis on diagnosis versus real-world viability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated visual dialog models that can better handle challenges like visual coreference resolution. The authors show that current state-of-the-art models still struggle with coreference, especially over longer distances in the dialog history. New models are needed that can track entities and references more effectively throughout a multi-turn dialog.

- Expanding the dialog grammar used to generate the CLEVR-Dialog dataset. The authors propose their grammar and dataset generation process as a "recipe" for creating increasingly complex dialogs by expanding the space of templates and primitives. This could allow creation of new datasets to drive further research.

- Studying additional challenges related to multi-modal reasoning and grounding. Beyond visual coreference, there may be other aspects of reasoning over vision and language that could be isolated and studied through extensions of the synthetic dialog approach.

- Applying insights gained from diagnostic datasets to improve performance on real-world visual dialog tasks. The authors motivate the need for controlled datasets like CLEVR-Dialog to deeply analyze models. But ultimately the goal is to transfer knowledge to improve results on complex, real visual dialog scenarios.

- Developing better evaluation metrics and benchmarks. The paper demonstrates new analyses enabled by the synthetic dataset, like the quantitative measurement of textual and visual grounding. But developing more comprehensive metrics remains an open challenge.

Overall, the main directions involve developing more capable models using new datasets as diagnostic tools, expanding the scope of visual reasoning studied, and applying insights from synthetic dialogs to real-world tasks. Diagnostic evaluation is a key theme that could enable a lot of future progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces CLEVR-Dialog, a new diagnostic dataset for studying multi-round reasoning and visual coreference resolution in visually-grounded dialog. The dataset consists of human-like dialogs grounded in images from the CLEVR dataset, which provides full scene graph annotations. A key aspect is the use of a dialog grammar to generate caption and question templates, resulting in conversational data with rich annotations. Experiments are performed with several baseline models, with analysis showing deteriorating performance as dialog history dependencies increase. The work enables detailed analysis of model capabilities on resolving visual coreferences, highlighting limitations of current methods. The authors argue CLEVR-Dialog can inform development of future models to address the challenges of visual reasoning in dialog.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents CLEVR-Dialog, a new synthetic dataset for studying visual dialog. The dataset is built by generating dialogs grounded in images from the CLEVR dataset. The images in CLEVR are synthetically generated and contain objects like cubes, spheres, and cylinders in plain backgrounds. Each image has an exhaustive scene graph annotation describing the objects, attributes, and relationships. The authors construct a dialog grammar grounded in these scene graphs to generate multi-round dialogs mimicking conversations between a Questioner and an Answerer. 

In total, CLEVR-Dialog contains over 4 million question-answer pairs over 85,000 images. The key advantage of this synthetic dataset is that it enables studying specific challenges in isolation, like visual coreference resolution. The paper shows the first analysis of how different visual dialog models perform on coreference resolution as a function of distance between mentions. The findings indicate significantly lower performance for questions requiring coreference resolution compared to simpler questions, highlighting room for improvement. Overall, CLEVR-Dialog enables detailed diagnostic evaluation of visual dialog models to inform future progress. The code and dataset are publicly released.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper develops a large diagnostic dataset called CLEVR-Dialog for studying multi-round reasoning in visually-grounded dialog. The dataset is generated by creating a dialog grammar grounded in the scene graphs of images from the CLEVR dataset. Specifically, dialog is viewed as communication between an Answerer (A-er), who can see the full image and scene graph, and a Questioner (Q-er), who cannot see the image and tries to reconstruct the scene graph over rounds of dialog. The A-er initiates the dialog with a grounded caption providing partial information about the scene graph. The Q-er assimilates this information into a partial scene graph and asks follow-up questions grounded in it, which the A-er answers to progress the dialog. Templates consisting of intuitive primitives like filter, count, exist, etc. are defined to generate captions and questions in a modular and efficient manner according to the dialog grammar. Using beam search with carefully designed objectives, the grammar is used to produce a diverse set of 10-round dialogs on CLEVR images. The combination of CLEVR's exhaustive annotation and the dialog grammar results in a dataset where all aspects including coreferences are annotated, enabling diagnostic evaluation of visual dialog models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key points about the problem/question addressed in this paper are:

- The paper focuses on studying intelligent systems that can see (through computer vision), talk (via dialog), and reason (by tracking entities, coreferences etc). Specifically, it addresses the problem of multi-round visually-grounded dialog, where an agent must answer a sequence of questions about an image, using dialog history as context. 

- Visual dialog entails challenges in vision, language, reasoning and grounding. But studying these sub-tasks in isolation requires full annotation of images and dialogs, which is infeasible for large real datasets like VisDial. 

- So the key question is - how to create a large-scale diagnostic dataset to study the different challenges in visual dialog, especially multi-round reasoning, in isolation?

- The paper introduces CLEVR-Dialog, a new synthetic dataset built on CLEVR images, which uses a dialog grammar grounded in scene graphs to generate fully annotated dialogs. This allows focused analysis of skills like coreference resolution.

- The dataset enables analyzing model performance on specific challenges (like coreference) as a function of history length/complexity. This kind of analysis was not possible on previous datasets due to lack of annotations.

In summary, the paper introduces a synthetic diagnostic dataset for multi-round reasoning in visual dialog, especially to benchmark coreference resolution and other skills as a function of history dependency. The key novelty is the fully annotated nature of the dataset which enables focused analysis not possible on previous real datasets.
