# [V2X-Real: a Largs-Scale Dataset for Vehicle-to-Everything Cooperative   Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing datasets for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) cooperative perception are limited to either vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) collaboration within a small area. There is no dataset to enable research on the full potential of V2X with all collaboration modes (V2V, V2I, infrastructure-to-infrastructure) in large, complex urban environments.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose V2X-Real, the first large-scale real-world dataset for comprehensive V2X cooperative perception research. 

- Data is collected via 2 connected automated vehicles and 2 smart infrastructures equipped with sensors like LiDARs and cameras in busy urban areas.

- In total the dataset contains 33K LiDAR frames, 171K camera images and over 1.2M 3D bounding box annotations across 10 categories.

- 4 specialized sub-datasets are provided: Vehicle-Centric (VC), Infrastructure-Centric (IC), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure (I2I).

Main Contributions:

- V2X-Real enables research on full range of V2X collaboration modes with much larger scale and complexity than prior datasets.

- It is the first open dataset to provide both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric benchmarks for cooperative perception.

- Comprehensive benchmarks are presented for multiple fusion strategies on all 4 sub-datasets, including both LiDAR and camera perception.

- V2X-Real pushes state-of-the-art by providing new challenging urban test cases with high object density (average 36 per scene).

- It is also the first cooperative perception benchmark on multiple object categories, beyond just vehicles.

In summary, through its scale, diversity and novelty, the V2X-Real dataset promises to greatly advance research in the pivotal space of V2X cooperative perception.
