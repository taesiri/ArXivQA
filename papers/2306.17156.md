## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using generative AI/large language models for programming education:

- This paper provides a more comprehensive benchmarking study than prior work. Many previous papers have focused on evaluating models for only 1-2 specific scenarios relevant to programming education (e.g. program repair, hint generation). In contrast, this paper systematically evaluates two state-of-the-art models across six diverse scenarios that capture different potential applications.

- The paper uses a more rigorous evaluation methodology. The study design involves expert-based quantitative and qualitative assessments on real-world buggy programs from an online platform. Many prior works relied more on anecdotal examples or small case studies. The comparative evaluation with human tutors also provides useful insights.

- The paper helps benchmark the latest models like GPT-4. Most prior works evaluated older or proprietary models like GPT-3, Codex, which are not publicly available anymore. This study provides up-to-date results on the capabilities of models like GPT-4.

- The paper highlights limitations of current models. By evaluating on a diverse set of scenarios, the paper identifies settings where even powerful models like GPT-4 struggle in comparison to human tutors. This points out promising directions for future work.

- The paper focuses specifically on introductory programming education. Some prior works have explored applications of LLMs more broadly in education. The specialized focus here provides more concrete insights for the programming education community.

Overall, this paper advances the field by providing a systematic, rigorous study benchmarking the latest state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. The insights on current capabilities and limitations will be useful for researchers and educators exploring the use of AI in introductory programming courses and tools.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using generative AI/large language models for programming education:

- The paper provides a systematic benchmarking study evaluating multiple state-of-the-art models (ChatGPT, GPT-4) across a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. Many prior works have focused on evaluating models for only 1-2 scenarios. So this paper takes a broader view of different roles AI agents could play.

- The paper compares the models not just to each other but also to human tutors. Many prior works only compared models to each other or to ground truth data. Comparing to human tutors provides a more meaningful benchmark.

- The evaluation methodology relies on expert annotations and assessments. Some prior works used automated metrics or metrics based on student surveys/experiences which can be limited. Expert assessments allow evaluating subtle aspects of quality.

- The models considered are very recent and state-of-the-art (ChatGPT, GPT-4). Many prior works evaluated older or proprietary models like Codex. Focusing on publicly available models allows easier reproducibility.

- The programming language considered is Python which is very popular for introductory CS education. Some prior works looked at less common languages.

- The paper identifies scenarios and problems where even GPT-4 struggles compared to human tutors. This points out exciting future directions for the community to develop techniques to improve these models further.

Overall, the comprehensive benchmarking, focus on recent publicly available models, and comparison to human tutors make this paper a significant contribution compared to prior work in this field. The paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art for using AI in programming education.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the lack of systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for various programming education scenarios. Specifically, it identifies the following limitations of prior work:

- Many prior works evaluated outdated models like OpenAI's Codex which is no longer publicly available. 

- Most prior works focused on only specific scenario(s) relevant to programming education, like generating explanations. There is a lack of study evaluating LLMs comprehensively for diverse scenarios.

To address this gap, the paper conducts a systematic evaluation to benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs - ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 - across six programming education scenarios: program repair, hint generation, grading feedback, pair programming, contextualized explanation, and task synthesis. It compares the performance of these LLMs to human tutors. 

The scenarios are designed to capture different potential roles of AI agents as digital tutors, assistants, and peers. The evaluation uses expert annotations on outputs generated by the methods for five introductory Python programming problems and associated real-world buggy programs.

In summary, the key question addressed is: How do current state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 perform compared to human experts across diverse programming education scenarios? The study aims to provide a comprehensive benchmark and highlight areas where these LLMs still struggle to guide future research.
