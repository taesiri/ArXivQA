# [Generating Potent Poisons and Backdoors from Scratch with Guided   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generating Potent Poisons and Backdoors from Scratch with Guided Diffusion":

Problem:
Modern neural networks are often trained on massive datasets scraped from the web. An adversary can exploit this by uploading malicious data to poison the victim's dataset. Existing poisoning attacks start with random clean images and modify them to create poisons. However, some clean images make better starting points for crafting more potent poisons. The paper investigates synthesizing optimal "base samples" from scratch to boost poisoning attack success.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP), which uses diffusion models to synthesize base samples tailored to enable more effective downstream poisoning. GDP guides the diffusion model using a poisoning objective function to bias it to generate samples near optimal poisons. But a weak guidance strength is used to ensure the base samples remain properly labeled and high quality. The base samples are then fed into existing poisoning algorithms to further optimize them into poisons. Only the most potent poisons are selected to include in the victim's dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Devises GDP, which synthesizes clean-label poisoned data from scratch using guided diffusion to enable more successful downstream poisoning attacks 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks, including in low poison budget regimes with very few poisons
- Demonstrates GDP can significantly boost existing poisoning methods by providing better starting base samples
- Generated poisons bypass 7 tested defenses while preserving image quality and labels based on human evaluation

In summary, the paper shows how guided diffusion can be adapted to generate synthetic base samples that lead to significantly more potent data poisoning and backdoor attacks compared to previous approaches. The proposed GDP method sets a new high bar for poisoning success rates.
