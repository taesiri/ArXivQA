# [Generating Potent Poisons and Backdoors from Scratch with Guided   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generating Potent Poisons and Backdoors from Scratch with Guided Diffusion":

Problem:
Modern neural networks are often trained on massive datasets scraped from the web. An adversary can exploit this by uploading malicious data to poison the victim's dataset. Existing poisoning attacks start with random clean images and modify them to create poisons. However, some clean images make better starting points for crafting more potent poisons. The paper investigates synthesizing optimal "base samples" from scratch to boost poisoning attack success.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP), which uses diffusion models to synthesize base samples tailored to enable more effective downstream poisoning. GDP guides the diffusion model using a poisoning objective function to bias it to generate samples near optimal poisons. But a weak guidance strength is used to ensure the base samples remain properly labeled and high quality. The base samples are then fed into existing poisoning algorithms to further optimize them into poisons. Only the most potent poisons are selected to include in the victim's dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Devises GDP, which synthesizes clean-label poisoned data from scratch using guided diffusion to enable more successful downstream poisoning attacks 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks, including in low poison budget regimes with very few poisons
- Demonstrates GDP can significantly boost existing poisoning methods by providing better starting base samples
- Generated poisons bypass 7 tested defenses while preserving image quality and labels based on human evaluation

In summary, the paper shows how guided diffusion can be adapted to generate synthetic base samples that lead to significantly more potent data poisoning and backdoor attacks compared to previous approaches. The proposed GDP method sets a new high bar for poisoning success rates.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to synthesize clean-label poisoned training data from scratch using guided diffusion models to generate base samples that enable more potent targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, even with small poisoning budgets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP) to generate clean-label poisoned training data from scratch using guided diffusion models. Specifically:

- GDP uses a diffusion model weakly guided by a poisoning objective to synthesize base samples that are very close to being potent poisons, while still looking like natural images. 

- These base samples can then be used to initialize downstream targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks, significantly boosting their effectiveness.

- Experiments show GDP enables much higher attack success rates than prior state-of-the-art, even with very small poisoning budgets (e.g. only 25-50 images poisoned out of 50,000 for CIFAR-10).

- The resulting attacks are stealthy, transferring to different model architectures, and can bypass several defenses. 

So in summary, the key innovation is using guided diffusion to generate high-quality base samples which serve as a powerful initialization for data poisoning attacks, enabling more potent poisons that fool models even when the attacker can only modify a tiny fraction of the training data.

The paper introduces a new method called "Guided Diffusion Poisoning" (GDP) to generate clean-label poisoned training data using diffusion models weakly guided by a poisoning objective function. This allows creating more potent poisons and backdoors for attacking image classifiers compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches. Key aspects examined include attack success rates with small poison budgets, transferability in black-box settings, robustness against defenses, and preservation of image quality/clean labels. Overall, the core focus is on pushing the limits of targeted and backdoor attacks in the low budget regime by synthesizing tailored poisons.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using guided diffusion to generate clean-label poisoned training data from scratch. How does the use of guided diffusion allow more effective poisons to be crafted compared to previous approaches that start with random clean images?

2. The paper claims GDP base samples are clean-label according to human evaluation. What was the evaluation procedure and what were the results that supported this claim? How does this validate the use of GDP base samples in downstream attacks?

3. The paper shows GDP boosts effectiveness of targeted data poisoning attacks even with very small poisoning budgets. What adaptations were made to existing attacks like Witches' Brew to allow them to succeed with fewer poisons? Why are these adaptations more successful? 

4. How exactly is the diffusion model guidance implemented using the universal guidance algorithm? What objectives and losses are incorporated to maintain image quality while optimizing for poisoning objectives?

5. The paper shows black-box transferability of GDP poisons across different model architectures. What properties of the GDP base samples facilitate greater transferability compared to prior attacks like Witches' Brew?

6. Several defenses are tested against GDP, but most fail to mitigate the attack. Which defenses are partially successful and how much do they degrade attack performance? What trade-offs exist?

7. The paper claims GDP base samples influence downstream attack optimization due to lying close to optimal poisons. What evidence supports this claim? And what explanations are provided?

8. What modifications could be made to the GDP pipeline to further enhance attack effectiveness? For example, changes to guidance objectives, the diffusion model, or the downstream attack algorithm.

9. What limitations exist in the GDP framework? For example, reliance on dataset-specific diffusion models. How can these limitations be addressed in future work?

10. The paper focuses on clean-label targeted poisoning and backdoor attacks. Could the GDP approach be extended to other threat models like availability attacks? What changes would need to be made?
