# [The Ink Splotch Effect: A Case Study on ChatGPT as a Co-Creative Game   Designer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is fear and skepticism in creative industries about AI threatening jobs and the role of human creativity. It is important to delineate what AI tools can provide versus what still requires human refinement in creative processes like game design. 

- This paper tests if a general AI assistant (ChatGPT) could make coherent creative choices for game design compared to a human designer, and if collaboration between the two can be beneficial.

Methodology: 
- 3 minimalist 2D games across genres (shooter, platformer, roguelike) were made: a base version, a human-designed version, a ChatGPT-guided version.

- Humans designed games based on initial intent and playtesting. ChatGPT was prompted for suggestions on features and feel. Its code was directly implemented.

- 45 participants blindly ranked 3 anonymized games in each genre on quality metrics in a user study.

Results:
- Human-designed games almost always ranked the highest, while ChatGPT games outranked base games.

- ChatGPT struggled with Unity engine context, but provided some compelling, genre-relevant suggestions.

- Humans displayed creative vision and understanding of feel, but sometimes had limited ideation.

Conclusion:
- AI cannot replace human creative intent and refinement. But LLMs like ChatGPT can provide inspiration, like an "ink splotch", for human designers.

- Clear differentiation found between AI-assisted tools versus human design. Collaboration can combine benefits of both.
