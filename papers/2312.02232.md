# [HumanNeRF-SE: A Simple yet Effective Approach to Animate HumanNeRF with   Diverse Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02232)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Previous methods for synthesizing novel views of humans from monocular videos require large neural networks and diverse training data. They struggle to generalize to poses significantly different from the training data and take a long time to train. The key challenges are avoiding overfitting to the limited training poses and efficiently combining explicit (e.g. SMPL model) and implicit (neural radiance field) human representations.

Method:
The paper proposes HumanNeRF-SE, a simple yet effective approach that combines explicit and implicit human representations with general and specific mapping processes. 

Key ideas:
- Construct voxel volume from SMPL vertices to obtain spatial features and filter non-body points
- General rigid mapping using nearest SMPL weights for coarse canonical coordinates 
- Specific refinement network with point features to correct unnatural deformations
- Avoid overfitting by not using frame features 

Benefits:
- Greatly reduces number of parameters and training time
- Achieves state-of-the-art metrics, especially LPIPS which measures human perception
- Generalizes significantly better to novel poses with few-shot data
- Increases rendering speed 15x without acceleration methods

Contributions:  
1) Adaptive space convolution to obtain features and filter points
2) Frozen general mapping and specific point refine network
3) Extremely effective combination of explicit and implicit representations
4) State-of-the-art pose generalization with 1000x fewer parameters and 20x less training time

The method represents humans simply yet effectively by filtering sampling points, coarse and refined mapping to a canonical space, and appearance/density prediction. This avoids overfitting and efficiently combines the SMPL model with a neural radiance field. Experiments validate state-of-the-art performance in terms of efficiency, few-shot generalization, and perceptual quality.
