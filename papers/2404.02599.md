# [Determining the Tactical Challenge of Scenarios to Efficiently Test   Automated Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Selecting relevant test scenarios to efficiently validate automated driving systems (ADS) is challenging. 
- Existing methods to determine the challenge of a scenario have limitations:
   - Rely on manual selection and calibration of metrics
   - Require predicting behavior of ADS
   - Only provide metric values not human-interpretable information
   - Cannot analyze test scenarios where only initial conditions of ADS are known

Proposed Solution:
- Present a "Challenge Description Method" to objectively describe tactical challenge of highway scenarios
- Uses reachability analysis to compute drivable area for normal ADS operation 
   - Defines normal operation by min/max velocity and acceleration
- Constructs "lane-aware reachability graph" to determine required lane changes
- Provides challenge description with number and timing of minimum required lane changes

Main Contributions:  
- Automatic analysis of combined information of all scenes, no scene-level aggregation needed
- Only 8 intuitive parameters, no complicated calibration
- Human-interpretable challenge descriptions useful for test scenario selection
- Applicable for multiple similar ADSs, does not depend on one specific implementation
- Showcased on 4 highway scenarios: handles static and moving vehicles, provides number and timing of required lane changes

In summary, the paper presents a novel method to objectively describe the tactical challenge of highway scenarios by analyzing the minimum required lane changes. The human-interpretable descriptions can help select efficient test scenarios for validating automated driving systems.
