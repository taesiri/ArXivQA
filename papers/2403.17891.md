# [Image-based Novel Fault Detection with Deep Learning Classifiers using   Hierarchical Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning fault classifiers typically assume a fixed set of fault types. This closed-set assumption prevents them from detecting novel fault types not seen during training. 
- Many real-world fault taxonomies have an inherent hierarchical structure that is often neglected. How to leverage hierarchical fault labels to improve detection of novel fault types in deep learning classifiers?

Proposed Solution:
- Inject hierarchical label information into deep fault classifiers via soft label regularization during training. This forces predictions to be hierarchically consistent with the known taxonomy.
- At test time, compute a hierarchically consistent OOD score along with standard OOD scores. This score detects samples inconsistent with the hierarchical taxonomy.
- Apply approach to enhance existing OOD scores - Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), Out-of-Distribution detector (ODIN) and Deep Mahalanobis Detector (DMD)

Main Contributions:  
- Novel methodology to incorporate hierarchical fault label structure into deep learning classifiers for improved novel fault detection
- Hierarchical regularization via soft labels during training to learn hierarchically consistent feature representations
- Hierarchically consistent OOD score for detecting taxonomy inconsistent samples at test time  
- Enhancements validated on real-world steel defect classification showing improved detection of unseen defect types with all baseline methods
- Analysis and intuition provided on why hierarchical treatment benefits OOD detection in deep classifiers

The key insight is that hierarchical consistency during training and testing helps expose novel faults as they violate the consistency with known labels. This approach is shown to be effective at improving state-of-the-art anomaly detectors that lack hierarchical awareness.
