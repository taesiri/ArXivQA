# [Signed Distance Field based Segmentation and Statistical Shape Modelling   of the Left Atrial Appendage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Patients with atrial fibrillation have increased risk of ischemic stroke due to blood clots forming in the left atrial appendage (LAA). 
- The shape and morphology of the LAA is thought to correlate with stroke risk but past studies show contradicting conclusions.  
- This may be because current methods rely on manual measurement and qualitative assessment which leads to poor reproducibility.  
- Quantitative shape analysis is needed but most segmentation methods don't produce smooth surface models suitable for this.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a pipeline for LAA segmentation, statistical shape modelling and quantitative analysis.  
- Use a 3D U-Net to predict a signed distance field (SDF) directly from CT images. The 0-level set of SDF gives a smooth surface mesh.
- Register all LAA shapes to a common template using volumetric SDF registration.  
- Build a statistical shape model (SSM) from corresponding shapes.
- Use SSM to analyze shape variation with PCA and cluster LAAs.

Main Contributions:
- Novel method to predict SDFs directly from medical images and extract smooth surface meshes.
- Achieves 95.24% Dice score for LA segmentation and 93.26% for LAA.
- Meshes are within 0.8mm of ground truth and suitable for computational analysis.  
- First SSM built for highly variable LAA anatomy using automatic pipeline.
- SSM reveals LAA shape can be described with 5 PCA modes. 
- Finds two clusters of shapes related to clinical chicken-wing and non-chicken-wing types.

In summary, the paper presents a fully automated pipeline using deep learning and SDFs to segment the LAA from CT scans and perform statistical shape analysis, revealing quantitative insights into LAA morphological variations.
