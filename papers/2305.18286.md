# [Photoswap: Personalized Subject Swapping in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18286)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we achieve personalized subject swapping in images, replacing a subject in a source image with a user-specified subject while maintaining the original pose and composition?The key hypothesis is that by learning to represent the visual concept of a subject from reference images, and transferring representative attention maps/outputs from the source image generation process, they can inject the new subject into the target image generation while keeping non-subject pixels unchanged. This allows seamlessly swapping subjects in images while preserving pose and overall coherence.In summary, the core research question is around developing a technique for automated, personalized subject swapping in images, and the hypothesis is that this can be achieved through learning subject concepts from references and attention manipulation in diffusion models. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed method, called Photoswap, for this challenging task.
