# [Bangla AI: A Framework for Machine Translation Utilizing Large Language   Models for Ethnic Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ethnic media serves immigrant communities by providing news in their native languages. However, ethnic media journalists face challenges accessing and translating mainstream English news into languages like Bangla.  
- Traditional machine translation tools often fail to provide contextually accurate translations for large volumes of text and low-resource languages like Bangla.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an algorithm called "Bangla AI" to empower ethnic media by leveraging emerging large language models (LLMs) and multi-lingual machine translation (MMT) capabilities.

- It outlines a framework to:
   1) Collect English news articles and extract themes using NLP
   2) Represent the data in matrix format with rows as news and columns as topics
   3) Train a classifier to categorize news types based on content  
   4) Translate specific categorized news from English to Bangla using LLM

Main Contributions:
- First study outlining potential of using LLMs and MMT to improve ethnic media translation and access to information
- Comprehensive algorithm and framework addressing the entire pipeline - from news selection, classification to translation
- Empowers marginalized communities by overcoming language barriers in accessing authentic news
- Opens door for analysis of LLMs and MMT for ethnic media before widespread adoption
- Can be extended to aid other ethnic media groups in the USA

In summary, the paper proposes "Bangla AI" - an innovative integration of LLMs and MMT to transform ethnic media practices by enabling superior news classification, selection and translation capabilities. The algorithm provides a blueprint for the breakthrough potential of advanced language technologies to connect mainstream and ethnic media across language divides.
