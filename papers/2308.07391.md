# [PARIS: Part-level Reconstruction and Motion Analysis for Articulated   Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07391)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we jointly perform part-level reconstruction and motion analysis for articulated objects from only multi-view RGB images observing the object in two different articulation states?In particular, the paper aims to address the coupled tasks of:1) Reconstructing the shape and appearance of the articulated parts of an object.2) Estimating the articulation motion parameters (joint type, axis, state) between the two observed states. The key ideas are to:- Learn separate implicit neural fields for the static and movable parts of the object.- Transform points sampled along camera rays between the two states using the estimated motion parameters in order to establish correspondence and extract the movable component. - Supervise the reconstruction and motion estimation in a self-supervised manner using only the input multi-view RGB images, without any 3D labels or motion supervision.The goal is to develop a method that can generalize to novel object categories in a category-agnostic manner, using only easily obtainable multi-view observations of the object in two states as input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing PARIS, an end-to-end neural architecture for joint part-level reconstruction and motion analysis of articulated objects from multi-view RGB images. - A self-supervised approach that learns implicit shape and appearance models for the static and movable parts of an articulated object, while also estimating the motion parameters, without requiring any 3D supervision or motion/semantic annotation.- Demonstrating that the proposed method generalizes well across object categories, outperforming baselines and prior work that take 3D point clouds as input. PARIS achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality and motion estimation accuracy.Specifically, the key aspects that differentiate PARIS seem to be:- Using only multi-view RGB images of an object in two static articulation states as input.- Learning separate neural fields for static and movable parts, compositing them using estimated motion parameters for self-supervision.- Being category-agnostic and not relying on any 3D data, motion parameters, or semantic supervision signals.- Reconstructing both shape and appearance at the part-level, while also estimating articulation motion parameters in an end-to-end manner.- Significantly outperforming baselines in quantitative evaluation on shape reconstruction and motion analysis, demonstrating good generalization across object categories.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and demonstrating a self-supervised neural approach for jointly tackling the intertwined tasks of reconstruction and motion analysis for articulated objects from only RGB images.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes PARIS, a self-supervised end-to-end architecture that learns part-level implicit shape and appearance models and jointly optimizes motion parameters for articulated objects from multi-view images in two static states, without requiring any 3D supervision, motion, or semantic annotation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper tackles the problem of simultaneous part-level reconstruction and motion analysis for articulated objects from only multi-view RGB images. This is a novel task formulation not addressed before. Prior work either focuses only on reconstruction or motion analysis, or requires other input modalities like 3D point clouds or depth images.- The proposed method PARIS is self-supervised and does not require any 3D or motion supervision. It jointly optimizes implicit neural fields for part-level shape and appearance along with motion parameters in an end-to-end manner. In contrast, most prior learning-based methods require full 3D and motion supervision.- PARIS is category-agnostic and does not rely on category-specific priors or models. This allows it to generalize to novel object categories not seen during training. In comparison, many prior methods train separate models for each object category.- Experimental evaluation shows PARIS significantly outperforms prior works like Ditto and baselines in terms of reconstruction quality and motion estimation across diverse articulated object categories. The ablation studies also provide useful insights into the method design.- Some limitations still remain in handling objects with severe occlusion or symmetric parts. Future work can aim to address these issues and extend the framework to handle multi-part articulation. Overall, this paper presents a novel problem formulation and promising solution that helps advance research on articulated object perception.In summary, this paper makes significant contributions over prior work by formulating and solving the joint reconstruction-motion analysis task for articulated objects in a category-agnostic, self-supervised manner using only RGB images as input. The proposed method and evaluations advance the state-of-the-art in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:- Extending their method to handle objects with multiple movable parts. The current method focuses on objects with a single movable part. Handling multiple parts would increase the complexity and introduce new challenges like dealing with part-part occlusion. - Developing techniques to automatically align the input views of the object in different states. Currently their method requires the input views to be pre-aligned, but aligning articulated 3D objects is a non-trivial problem itself. Automating this alignment would make their approach more practical.- Adapting their approach to work with fewer input views. They show a significant performance drop when using less than 16 input views per state. Developing techniques to reconstruct articulated objects from fewer images would be an important direction.- Applying their self-supervised framework to other tasks like articulated object tracking in video, or interactive articulation where a robot manipulates an object. Their approach could potentially enable new applications.- Exploring intermediate supervisions between pure self-supervision and full 3D supervision. For example, using 2D keypoints or coarse 3D points as weak supervision signals. This could help improve accuracy and robustness.- Generalizing to real-world capture conditions with complex backgrounds, occlusion and lighting changes. Showing their method works on real articulated objects "in the wild" would be impactful.So in summary, extending their approach to more complex objects, using less supervision, enabling new applications, and proving robustness to real capture conditions seem like promising future directions based on this paper.
