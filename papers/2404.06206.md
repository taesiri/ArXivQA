# [Deep Learning Method for Computing Committor Functions with Adaptive   Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Computing high-dimensional committor functions is important for understanding transition mechanisms between metastable states in complex systems like biomolecules. 
- However, sampling adequate data that covers the entire transition tube at low temperatures is challenging. Existing methods either require prior knowledge about the transition or do not fully explore the transition tube.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a deep learning method with two novel adaptive sampling schemes (I and II) that can generate uniform data along the transition tube by utilizing the learned committor function.

- Sampling Scheme I: Performs metadynamics using a variable $r_\theta$ that depends on the learned committor $q_\theta$. This spreads data from transition state region to the entire tube.

- Sampling Scheme II: Samples data from an equilibrium distribution based on the free energy $F_{q_\theta}$ associated with $q_\theta$. This produces uniform data along the transition tube.

Main Contributions:

- Provides theoretical analysis to show sampling scheme II generates uniform data along the transition tube, which is ideal for sampling the tube.

- Adaptive sampling schemes enable exploration of the entire transition tube without needing extensive prior knowledge about the transition states.

- Demonstrates high accuracy of the computed committor functions on test cases including alanine dipeptide and solvated dimer system.

- Shows superior performance over umbrella sampling method for computing committor, indicating promise for studying complex system transitions.

In summary, the paper develops an efficient deep learning approach integrated with adaptive sampling to compute committor functions by fully exploring the transition tube to generate adequate samples.
