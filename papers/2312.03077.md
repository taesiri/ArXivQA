# [Clinical Notes Reveal Physician Fatigue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physician fatigue can negatively impact patient care, but it is difficult to measure fatigue at an individual patient level. Prior studies rely on coarse measures of drivers of fatigue like workload, which are imperfectly correlated with actual fatigue.

- There are also open questions around whether physician fatigue correlates with patient demographics like race, as well as implications for use of AI like large language models (LLMs) in clinical documentation.

Method:
- The authors develop a model to estimate physician fatigue at the time of writing a clinical note, by predicting whether the note was written after a high vs low workload week.

- The model uses interpretable features related to note length, predictability, readability, pronouns, emotions, etc. It is trained and evaluated on 129,228 notes across 60 physicians.

Results:
- The model can estimate fatigue levels, validated by correlation with overnight shifts, circadian disruption, and intra-shift workload. 

- Higher predicted fatigue is associated with 18% lower testing yield for heart attacks, suggesting an impact on clinical decision quality.

- Notes for Black and Hispanic patients have 12-21% higher predicted fatigue compared to White patients.

- LLM-generated notes have 17% higher predicted fatigue compared to real notes.

Implications:
- Fine-grained estimation of fatigue from notes enables studying impacts on outcomes and disparities.

- Biases in predicted fatigue could reflect differential engagement with patients.

- Biases could also manifest in LLM-generated notes, necessitating new quality assurance methods before deployment.

In summary, the paper presents a novel method to estimate physician fatigue for studying its effects on care quality and equity, with implications for appropriate use of AI.
