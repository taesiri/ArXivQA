# [SPARF: Neural Radiance Fields from Sparse and Noisy Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11738)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we enable high-quality novel view synthesis from neural radiance fields when only a sparse set of input views (as few as 3) with noisy camera poses are available?

The authors aim to address the limitations of existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods, which rely on dense input views and highly accurate camera poses. In real-world settings, only sparse wide-baseline images may be available and camera pose estimation can be noisy, making novel view synthesis challenging. 

To tackle this, the paper proposes a new approach called SPARF (Sparse Pose Adjusting Radiance Fields) with two main contributions:

1) A multi-view correspondence objective that exploits matches between input views to jointly optimize the radiance field and refine the noisy camera poses towards a globally geometrically consistent solution. 

2) A depth consistency loss that encourages the optimized scene geometry to be consistent across all viewpoints, including novel views.

Overall, the key research focus is on enabling high-quality novel view synthesis from neural radiance fields even with sparse, wide-baseline input views and uncertain camera poses, which is more reflective of real-world conditions. The proposed SPARF method aims to address the limitations of prior NeRF techniques in this challenging setting.
