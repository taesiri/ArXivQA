# [Continual Learning with Pre-Trained Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16386)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Definition:
- Continual learning (CL) focuses on the scenario where data comes in a stream of tasks. The goal is to continually acquire knowledge about all seen tasks without catastrophically forgetting previous ones. 
- Traditional CL methods start training from scratch, whereas recently pre-trained models (PTMs) have shown strong capabilities for CL due to their innate generalization ability.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive survey on recent advancements in PTM-based continual learning.
- Systematic categorization of existing methods into prompt-based, representation-based and model mixture-based. 
- In-depth analysis of pros/cons of each category and experimental comparison on 7 benchmark datasets.
- Identification of an unfair advantage in a state-of-the-art method, raising concerns for fair evaluation.
- Highlights limitations of current approaches and provides promising future directions.  

Proposed Solutions:
- Prompt-based methods introduce lightweight prompts to tune the PTM for new tasks while retaining generalizability. Various prompt selection/generation strategies are explored.
- Representation-based methods directly utilize the frozen features of PTMs, e.g. building class prototypes or concatenating features from the PTM and adapted model.
- Mixture-based methods maintain a set of models and merge/ensemble them for robust predictions, balancing between generalizability and adaptivity.

Outcomes of Experiments:
- Simple baselines demonstrate surprisingly strong performance, indicating inherent capability of PTMs. 
- Need for more challenging benchmarks with distribution shifts to evaluate continual learning.
- Concerns raised regarding fair comparison practices in existing state-of-the-art.

Future Directions Highlighted:
- Continual learning for large language models
- Multi-modal continual learning 
- Computationally efficient continual learning
- New benchmarks with distribution gaps
- Theoretical analysis of advantages of PTMs for continual learning

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes PTM-based continual learning methods into prompt-based, representation-based, and model mixture-based. Can you elaborate on the key ideas and differences between these categories? What are the pros and cons of each?

2. The paper highlights prototype-based methods like SimpleCIL as a strong PTM-based CL baseline. Why do you think directly utilizing PTM representations works well for continual learning? What theories or analyses support this?

3. The paper points out an issue with the DAP method - that it uses batch information during testing. Why is this problematic? How could the method be adapted to avoid this issue? 

4. Model mixture methods like ESN and HiDe-Prompt utilize model merging or ensembling. What are the key challenges in designing the mixture/merging strategy? How could these methods be improved?

5. The paper suggests new CL benchmarks are needed that exhibit a greater domain gap from ImageNet. What properties would an effective out-of-distribution benchmark have for evaluating continual learning with PTMs?

6. Prompt-based methods optimize prompts to encode task-specific information into the PTM. However, the paper notes performance limitations compared to prototype methods. Why might adding prompts fail to improve performance - is it an optimization issue?

7. The paper notes prototype methods can suffer from redundancy by concatenating features from different backbones. How could this issue be addressed? Are there other potential problems with the prototype calculation?

8. Model mixture methods require saving historical models or frequent weight merging. How could these high memory/computation costs be reduced to make these methods more efficient?

9. The paper suggests PTMs help alleviate catastrophic forgetting in CL. What theories could explain why PTMs better retain prior knowledge compared to training from scratch? 

10. What types of theoretical analysis would be useful to better understand the advantages of PTMs for continual learning? What questions remain unanswered?
