# [Solution-oriented Agent-based Models Generation with Verifier-assisted   Iterative In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Solution-oriented Agent-based Models Generation with Verifier-assisted Iterative In-context Learning":

Problem: 
Agent-based models (ABMs) are useful for proposing and validating solutions for complex systems, but developing them requires labor-intensive effort and multidisciplinary expertise. Large language models (LLMs) have knowledge and programming capabilities to potentially automate this, but they struggle with the nonlinear dynamics and intricate agent interactions in ABMs. They also lack self-evaluation abilities to ensure solution quality.  

Solution:
The paper presents SAGE, an automatic framework to generate executable and verifiable ABM-based solutions using LLMs. SAGE has two stages - Modeling to generate an executable ABM replicating a problem scenario, and Solving to iteratively generate solutions for that ABM using a two-level verifier and chain-of-thought prompting.  

In the Modeling stage, a semi-structured conceptual representation helps users describe scenarios which the LLM converts into executable ABM code. Verifier-level1 identifies compilation errors and lacking details to ensure code integrity and executability. In the Solving stage, users provide an objective representation of the problem and desired solution effects. Verifier-level2 assesses if simulation results meet objectives, driving iterative optimization of solutions. Chain-of-thought prompts decompose solution generation into relations extraction, cause analysis and solution proposal steps to mitigate LLM limitations.

Main Contributions:
1) SAGE framework enabling automatic generation of executable and verifiable ABM solutions using LLMs
2) Conceptual and objective representations balancing natural language expressivity and program accuracy
3) Two-level verifier and chain-of-thought prompting guiding LLMs to effectively model complex systems and formulate solutions
4) Solution-oriented ABM evaluation dataset spanning diverse domains to assess modeling and problem-solving abilities
