# [Fair Classification with Partial Feedback: An Exploration-Based   Data-Collection Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of data collection for accurate classification in settings with partial feedback, where true outcome labels are only observed for samples that were positively classified in the past. For example, in lending, loan default outcomes are only observed for applicants who were given a loan. Past observations then form training datasets for classifiers that make future predictions. However, such training data lacks information about outcomes of samples that were negatively classified in the past, which can lead to biased datasets and erroneous classifiers. This problem is further compounded when there are disparities in the predictions across different demographic groups (e.g. gender or race) due to historical biases.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an iterative framework that simultaneously collects additional outcome data and makes predictions at each iteration. It employs both exploitation and exploration strategies - using available data to make predictions in "exploit" regions where outcome information is sufficient, while also positively classifying certain samples from "explore" regions to gather their outcome information. The framework allows incorporating fairness mechanisms in both exploit and explore components to reduce disparate impact. It also constrains the fraction of false positives per iteration.  

Main Contributions:
- Framework for simultaneous data collection and prediction that provides high utility per iteration while gathering outcomes for unobserved groups
- Flexibility to incorporate different exploration strategies, including strategies that encode fairness notions  
- Theoretical guarantees on feasibility, group-wise utility improvement, and convergence to optimal classifier
- Empirical evaluation showing improved data collection and prediction accuracy with small loss in utility due to exploration

The key insight is that explicit exploration along with exploitation is crucial for reducing biases, especially in contexts where certain groups have been historically marginalized. The paper provides a principled approach to achieve this.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework for fair classification that uses both exploitation (to ensure high utility) and exploration (to gather outcome data for under-represented groups) at each iteration, provides theoretical guarantees on feasibility, fairness, and convergence, and demonstrates empirically that the approach improves data quality and classifier performance while ensuring fairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an exploration-based data collection approach for fair classification in the partial feedback setting. Specifically, the paper:

- Proposes an iterative framework that simultaneously performs exploitation (makes predictions using available training data) and exploration (gathers additional outcome data, especially for underrepresented groups) at each iteration. This allows the framework to ensure high utility at every iteration while still collecting useful data over time.

- Provides a family of exploration strategies that can encode different notions of fairness and priorities for data collection across groups. The choice of exploration strategy is flexible based on the application context.

- Shows theoretically that the proposed approach (1) satisfies a bound on false discoveries/false positives, (2) improves utility for all groups over iterations, and (3) converges to an optimal fair classifier that has access to complete population data.

- Demonstrates empirically that the framework gathers high-quality data over time, leading to improved classifier utility and lower disparity across groups, with minimal loss in short-term per-iteration performance compared to baselines.

In summary, the key contribution is a practical and robust framework for addressing challenges in fair classification that arise due to biases encoded in the partial and selective data available in many real-world applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Partial feedback setting - A setting where true outcome labels are only observed for positively classified samples. This leads to biased training data.

- False discovery rate (FDR) - A metric that captures the fraction of false positives among positively classified samples. The paper uses FDR constraints to limit false positives.

- Exploration strategies - Strategies used by the proposed framework to select samples from the "explore" region to gather additional label information. Different exploration strategies can incorporate fairness. 

- Exploitation - Using available labeled data to train a classifier that maximizes utility over a defined "exploit" region of samples.

- Utility metric - Formalizes the optimization goal, e.g. accuracy or revenue. Used to train classifiers over exploit regions.

- Fairness constraints - Constraints imposed while training classifiers to ensure similar performance across groups defined by protected attributes like gender or race. 

- Convergence guarantees - Theoretical results showing the predictive performance of learned classifiers converges to that of the optimal classifier, proving effectiveness of exploration.

So in summary, key ideas include using exploitation and exploration simultaneously, FDR constraints, utility maximization, fairness mechanisms, and convergence guarantees in the partial feedback setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative framework for data collection and prediction. What are the key steps in each iteration? How do the exploitation and exploration steps work? 

2. One core component is the reweighting used when training classifier $f_t$. What is the intuition behind this reweighting and how does it help ensure an unbiased estimate of the underlying distribution?

3. The paper theoretically shows that the predictions satisfy a bounded false discovery rate. Walk through the key steps in the proof of Theorem 1. What assumptions are made and why are they important?

4. How exactly does the paper incorporate fairness into the proposed framework, both during exploitation and exploration? Explain the intuition behind some of the fair exploration strategies discussed. 

5. The sample complexity results have a linear dependence on the domain size which can be problematic in practice. What approaches could be used to improve the sample complexity under additional assumptions on the underlying distribution?

6. The empirical evaluations are done under the assumption that the test samples in each iteration are i.i.d. draws from the dataset distribution. Critically analyze whether this experimentally simulates a realistic setting and how could the evaluations be improved.  

7. The paper claims convergence of the learned classifiers to the optimal offline classifier that has access to the true underlying distribution. Walk through the proof of convergence and explain if and why this is significant.

8. How suitable is the proposed framework for handling distribution shifts over iterations? What modifications could make it more robust to shifts?

9. The choice of exploration function $g$ plays an important role in balancing exploration and exploitation. Critically analyze the various choices discussed in the paper and suggest other potential options. 

10. The paper makes minimal assumptions about the underlying data distribution which helps ensure wide applicability. But this generality comes at the cost of certain limitations. Discuss some of the major limitations of the framework and how they could possibly be addressed.
