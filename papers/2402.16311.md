# [Cross-domain Chinese Sentence Pattern Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sentence Pattern Structure (SPS) parsing is a syntactic analysis method used in language teaching to annotate components like subject, predicate, object etc. 
- Existing SPS parsers rely heavily on textbook corpora for training, lacking cross-domain capability.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an innovative approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) within a self-training framework to enhance adaptability and flexibility.
- Partial syntactic rules from source domain combined with target domain sentences to dynamically generate specialized training data.
- Address LLM instability and hallucination issues by incorporating rule-based methods in data generation and pseudo-tree selection.

Main Contributions:
- Present the novel task of cross-domain SPS parsing to effectively expand its applicability.  
- Propose an innovative LLM-enhanced self-training method to facilitate transfer of an SPS parser from source to target domain.
- Experimental findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing significant improvements in accuracy across domains.

The key ideas are using LLMs to generate target domain training data based on source domain rules, and filtering the generated data with rule-based criteria. This allows adapting an SPS parser trained on textbook data to the news domain, addressing the lack of cross-domain capability in existing parsers. The method is shown to improve performance over rule-based baselines.
