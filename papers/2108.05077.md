# [Mining the Benefits of Two-stage and One-stage HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05077)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel one-stage framework with cascade disentangling architecture for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The key idea is to combine the advantages of conventional two-stage methods and one-stage methods. Specifically, the proposed Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN) consists of a human-object pair decoder (HO-PD) to accurately locate interactive human-object pairs, followed by an isolated interaction decoder to focus solely on classifying actions for each detected pair. This disentangled cascade design allows concentrating on human-object detection and interaction classification separately. CDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, achieving 32.07 mAP on HICO-Det dataset, with relative gains of 55.71% and 9.32% over the best two-stage and one-stage methods. In particular, CDN promotes rare classes performance by 25.35%, indicating it is effective at alleviating the long-tail problem. Further ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed disentangling paradigm and the contributions of additional strategies like decoupling dynamic re-weighting and pair-wise NMS. The key innovation is effectively combining the essence of two-stage methods on isolating detection and classification with the accuracy and efficiency merits of one-stage methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel one-stage human-object interaction detection framework with cascade disentangling decoders to combine the advantages of accurately locating interactive human-object pairs from one-stage methods and isolating human-object detection and interaction classification from two-stage methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel one-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction classification in a cascade manner. Specifically, the paper:

1) Conducts a detailed analysis of pros and cons of conventional two-stage and one-stage HOI detection paradigms. 

2) Proposes a cascade disentangling network (CDN) that keeps the advantages of one-stage methods to directly and accurately locate interactive human-object pairs, and brings in the benefits of two-stage methods to disentangle detection and interaction classification.

3) Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets. The proposed CDN outperforms previous methods by a large margin, with a relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel one-stage cascade disentangling framework that combines strengths of both two-stage and one-stage HOI detection paradigms.
