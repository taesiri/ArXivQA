# [Can LLM find the green circle? Investigation and Human-guided tool   manipulation for compositional generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Compositional generalization evaluates models' ability to understand novel combinations of known components in language. Prior specialized models exhibit poor generalization. Though large language models (LLMs) show impressive generalization via in-context learning (ICL), their potential for compositional generalization is unexplored.

Methods Studied:  
- The authors empirically evaluate prevailing ICL methods on compositional generalization using GPT-3.5, including zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT).

Key Findings:
- Existing ICL methods perform poorly, struggling with long reasoning chains and complex syntactic structures. Though CoT and PoT mitigate some issues, CoT suffers cumulative errors and PoT struggles to generalize across syntactic variations.

Proposed Solution:  
- A human-guided tool manipulation framework (HTM) that decomposes questions into sub-problems, generates simple tools to solve sub-problems, and integrates tools to address the full question, with minimal human guidance.  

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis showing limitations of prevailing ICL methods on compositional generalization.
- Novel HTM framework that simplifies tool complexity through decomposition and integration, guided lightly by humans.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on two benchmarks, improving over 70% on the most challenging test set.

The proposed HTM framework effectively utilizes human guidance during planning and making tools to overcome limitations of fully automated approaches, while integrating tools to simplify reasoning burden on LLMs. By decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-problems solved by tailored tools, the approach enhances compositional generalization.
