# [Finding the Missing Data: A BERT-inspired Approach Against Package Loss   in Wireless Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- WiFi-based sensing uses Channel State Information (CSI) which often suffers from uneven data distribution due to packet loss, which negatively impacts machine learning models that require consistent input dimensions. 
- Traditional interpolation methods for recovering lost CSI packets fail to consider relationships between transmitters, receivers, and subcarriers.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose CSI-BERT, a novel deep learning model based on BERT architecture from natural language processing, for recovering lost CSI packets.
- Introduce new embedding layer to directly process continuous CSI data along with time information, eliminating need to discretize into tokens.
- Present self-supervised pre-training method to train on incomplete CSI sequences from target dataset. 
- Employ adversarial learning for more realistic recovered CSI.

Key Contributions:
- First deep learning model designed specifically for CSI recovery that leverages BERT's powerful contextual comprehension capabilities.
- Achieves lower recovery error and faster recovery speed than traditional interpolation methods, even with high packet loss rates.
- Recovered CSI from CSI-BERT improves other models' (like ResNet, RNN) accuracy on WiFi sensing tasks by ~15% on average.
- CSI-BERT itself shows excellent performance on CSI sensing tasks like human action classification and people identification.
- Proposes techniques like processing continuous data with time embeddings and self-supervised pre-training that provide direction for using NLP models on CSI data.

In summary, the paper presents CSI-BERT that successfully applies BERT architecture to address the key issue of packet loss in WiFi sensing by accurately recovering lost CSI for improved performance of sensing models.
