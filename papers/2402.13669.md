# [Self-Distillation Bridges Distribution Gap in Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13669)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores how to enhance the capabilities of large language models through distillation, adapting them for improved performance on specialized datasets while retaining broad capabilities. 

Methods:
- Fine-tuning is applied to the Llama-2 7B parameter model using the LoRA method on subsets of several datasets: Alpaca, Dolly, MagiCoder, LIMA, GSM8K and OpenFunction. 
- Training occurs for 2-5 epochs depending on dataset. 
- Performance is evaluated using the AlpacaEval framework with GPT-4 as evaluator.

Templates:
- The standard Alpaca template is used for most experiments during training and evaluation. 
- For mathematical reasoning datasets GSM8K and MultiArith, modified templates are used to provide more scaffolding and specification of final integer answer format.

Results:
- Examples of distilled responses for each dataset are provided, showing more detailed and step-by-step explanations for mathematical and programming problems compared to original one-line answers.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates a methodology for specializing large language models to enhance performance on niche datasets through distillation while retaining broad capabilities.
- Provides optimized templates tailored for different tasks to enable better scaffolding during training.
- Shows examples of improved reasoning exhibited in distilled responses to programming, mathematical and language understanding problems.
