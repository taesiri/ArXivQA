# [waveSLAM: Empowering Accurate Indoor Mapping Using Off-the-Shelf   Millimeter-wave Self-sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07192)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents waveSLAM, a novel indoor mapping system that leverages off-the-shelf 60 GHz millimeter-wave radios to complement existing LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solutions. The key idea is to reuse the sensing capabilities already available in commercial mmWave devices equipped on mobile robots to improve mapping accuracy in environments with reduced visibility (e.g. fog, smoke) or transparent surfaces where optical sensors fail. Specifically, waveSLAM extracts time-of-flight distance and angle-of-arrival estimates from the mmWave radios through self-sensing, then combines this information with lidar and odometry to generate more robust point cloud estimations. The system is validated through a custom-built prototype using COTS hardware, showing centimeter-level precision below 22 cm error across different real-world scenarios. A unique capability is enabling visibility through glass walls. By empowering optical SLAM with additional mmWave sensing, waveSLAM provides a practical approach to improving mapping accuracy without requiring specialized radar or modifications to existing robots. Key results show compatibility with lidar performance in terms of precision. The work represents an important step towards leveraging communication capabilities for accurate environment sensing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents waveSLAM, a system that uses self-sensing between off-the-shelf 60GHz radios on a mobile robot to complement LiDAR-based SLAM in low visibility environments by providing additional distance and angle estimations to improve mapping accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and evaluation of waveSLAM, a low-cost mobile robot system that uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) millimeter wave (mmWave) communication devices to enhance indoor mapping in environments with reduced visibility or glass/mirror walls where optical sensors like LiDARs struggle. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) The design of waveSLAM, which leverages mmWave self-sensing between devices on the robot to get accurate distance and angle estimations that complement the LiDAR point cloud. This allows creating accurate maps even with translucent materials.

2) The implementation of a real waveSLAM prototype using COTS 60 GHz mmWave devices and experiments in a real indoor environment. 

3) Experimental results that validate the cm-level accuracy of waveSLAM, with distance errors below 22 cm and angle errors below 20 degrees across different settings. This is compatible with LiDAR for building indoor maps.

So in summary, the main contribution is the novel concept and practical implementation of a mmWave-enhanced SLAM system that can overcome limitations of standard optical sensor based approaches.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Building accurate indoor maps using mobile robots and optical sensors like LiDAR can be challenging in environments with low visibility conditions (e.g. dust, fog, smoke) or transparent materials like glass walls. These limitations motivate exploring alternative sensing solutions.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes "waveSLAM", a system that leverages self-sensing capabilities of off-the-shelf 60GHz mmWave radios to complement LiDAR for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The key idea is to mount mmWave radios on the robot facing each other. As the robot navigates, these radios use fine timing measurement (FTM) and channel state information (CSI) to periodically estimate distance and angle to obstacles. This mmWave sensing data is combined with LiDAR and odometry to build the map.

Key Contributions:
- Design of waveSLAM system architecture that integrates COTS mmWave self-sensing with LiDAR-based SLAM
- Prototype implementation using off-the-shelf mmWave radios and ROS-based robot with LiDAR 
- Experimental evaluation in indoor environment with different materials 
- Demonstrated cm-level accuracy in distance and 20 degree angle error using mmWave sensing
- Improved mapping accuracy compared to LiDAR-only solution in challenged environments

The key novelty is using 60GHz communication radios for sensing to assist SLAM instead of treated as independent data sources. This reduces complexity and cost compared to radar or other custom sensing solutions. The results showcase the feasibility and value of joint communication and sensing with COTS hardware.
