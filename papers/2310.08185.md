# [EIPE-text: Evaluation-Guided Iterative Plan Extraction for Long-Form   Narrative Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08185)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop an effective framework for long-form narrative text generation that can produce coherent and logically structured narratives that remain faithful to an initial premise over an extended length?

The key aspects of this research question are:

- Focusing on long-form narrative text generation, as opposed to short texts or dialogue. This requires maintaining coherence and logical progression over a much longer span.

- Seeking to develop an effective framework or methodology for this task, rather than just evaluating existing models.

- Aiming to generate narratives that align with an initial premise or prompt, ensuring relevance rather than rambling or tangential content. 

- Emphasizing coherence of the narrative, with a logical flow and structure, rather than disjointed or confusing text.

The paper seems to address this research question by proposing the EIPE-text framework, which utilizes iterative plan extraction, learning of an improved planner, and hierarchical text generation based on the plan. The goal is to produce coherent, logically structured, and relevant long-form narratives through this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new framework called EIPE-text for long-form narrative text generation. The key ideas are:

- Extracting plans iteratively from a corpus of narratives and using them to build a better planner through fine-tuning or in-context learning. This enhances the model's ability to generate high-quality plans.

- Leveraging a QA-based evaluation method to assess the quality of extracted plans and their alignment with source narratives. Based on QA results, the framework generates detailed instructions to iteratively refine the plans.

- Using the learned planner to first generate a plan, then generate the full narrative conditioned on the plan in a hierarchical process. 

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of EIPE-text on generating coherent and relevant narratives in the domains of novels and storytelling.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing this EIPE-text framework to extract and leverage plans for improving long-form text generation through an iterative QA-based extraction process and a hierarchical generation approach. The key novelty lies in the iterative plan extraction and QA-based evaluation methodology.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Evaluation-Guided Iterative Plan Extraction for long-form narrative text generation (EIPE-text), which extracts high-quality plans from a narrative corpus through iterative refinement guided by QA-based evaluation, and uses the extracted plans to learn an improved narrative planner for generating more coherent and relevant long-form narratives.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in long-form narrative text generation:

- It proposes a new framework (EIPE-text) for extracting high-quality plans from narrative corpora and using those plans to train better planners. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like Re3, DOC, and recurrentGPT that rely more on prompting large LMs to generate plans.  

- The QA-based evaluation mechanism for automatically assessing and refining plans is also an innovative technique not seen in previous methods. This allows for more targeted improvement of plans versus just scoring/comparing outputs.

- Applying the framework to novels and storytelling demonstrates effectiveness in producing coherent, relevant narratives versus baselines. Most prior work focused solely on one genre, often story writing.

- Leveraging both finetuning and in-context learning to adapt the planner is more flexible than just finetuning an LM on plan data. This better enables domain/style adaptation.

- The overall hierarchical generation approach aligns with recent trends in long-form text generation. But the emphasis on learning an improved planner, plus the QA-based refinement, distinguishes this work and addresses limitations in existing hierarchical methods.

In summary, the EIPE-text framework introduces novel techniques for plan extraction, evaluation, and planner learning that advance the state-of-the-art in long-form narrative generation. The experiments in multiple domains also demonstrate broader applicability versus prior genre-specific systems. The proposed ideas could be built upon and extended in future research to further enhance coherence and relevance in generated narratives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring applications and extensions of EIPE-text in other domains beyond novels and storytelling, such as business reports, journalism, video game narratives, etc. The framework could be adapted to enhance coherence and structure for different long-form narrative writing tasks.

- Combining EIPE-text with other hierarchical text generation methods like Re3, DOC, and recurrentGPT. The authors mention their planning approach is complementary and could be integrated with downstream narrative generation. 

- Investigating alternatives to the QA-based evaluation mechanism for plan quality, to reduce reliance on reasoning skills of the base LLM.

- Improving out-of-distribution performance through techniques like few-shot prompting. The plan corpus currently makes EIPE-text more data-driven.

- Exploring human-AI collaborative applications of EIPE-text, where the plan provides an outline for human authors to review and modify.

- Enhancing the narrative generation stage, as the current work focused more on planning - this could involve long-range modeling, continuity metrics, etc.

- Evaluating EIPE-text on a broader range of LLMs beyond GPT-3, to analyze scalability and generalization ability.

- Open-sourcing the model implementation and releasing datasets to facilitate further research building on EIPE-text.

In summary, the main future directions are applying EIPE-text to new domains and narrative generation tasks, integrating it with other models, improving out-of-distribution robustness, leveraging human-AI collaboration, and releasing code and data for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Evaluation-Guided Iterative Plan Extraction for Long-Form Narrative Text Generation (EIPE-text). The key idea is to automatically extract high-quality plans from a corpus of narratives and use these plans to train a better "planner" model for generating coherent, relevant long-form narratives. EIPE-text has three main stages - plan extraction, learning, and inference. In the extraction stage, it iteratively extracts plans from narratives using a QA-based evaluation mechanism to refine the plans. These extracted plans are compiled into a plan corpus to train the planner. In the learning stage, the planner is trained using the plan corpus via fine-tuning or in-context learning. During inference, the planner generates a plan given a premise, and the narrative is generated conditioned on the plan. Experiments in novel generation and TED talk storytelling show EIPE-text can produce more coherent and relevant narratives than baselines. Key contributions are the iterative QA-based plan extraction method and demonstrating improved narrative generation by learning from extracted plans.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Evaluation-guided Iterative Plan Extraction for long-form narrative text generation (EIPE-text). The framework consists of three main stages: plan extraction, learning, and inference. 

In the plan extraction stage, plans are iteratively extracted from a corpus of narratives and improved through a QA-based self-evaluation mechanism. This involves generating QA pairs to evaluate the plans, identifying issues through QA, and refining the plans based on detailed instructions. The refined plans are compiled into a plan corpus. In the learning stage, the plan corpus is used to train a better planner, either by fine-tuning or using the plans as in-context examples. Finally, in the inference stage, the planner generates a high-quality plan which guides the narrative generation. Experiments in the domains of novels and TED talks show EIPE-text can produce more coherent narratives than state-of-the-art baselines.

Key innovations include the iterative plan extraction process with QA-based evaluation and plan refinement, as well as the use of extracted plans to learn an improved planner. The framework is shown to enhance coherence and relevance in long-form narratives. Overall, EIPE-text represents a novel technique leveraging plans and self-evaluation to achieve stronger narrative generation capabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Evaluation-Guided Iterative Plan Extraction for Long-Form Narrative Text Generation (EIPE-text). The framework has three main stages - plan extraction, learning, and inference. In the plan extraction stage, plans are iteratively extracted from a corpus of narratives and refined using a QA-based evaluation mechanism. Specifically, QA pairs are generated to evaluate the extracted plans. Based on the QA evaluation results, detailed instructions are provided to refine the plans iteratively until they pass the evaluation. The extracted plans are compiled into a plan corpus. In the learning stage, the plan corpus is used to train a planner model either by fine-tuning or in-context learning. Finally, in the inference stage, the learned planner generates a high-quality plan based on a premise, and the narrative text is generated conditioned on the plan. The key novelty is the iterative plan extraction using QA-based evaluation and plan refinement, which allows creating a high-quality plan corpus to train an improved planner. Experiments in novel and storytelling domains demonstrate the effectiveness of EIPE-text in generating coherent and relevant long narratives.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem/question it is addressing is:

How to generate more coherent and relevant long-form narratives using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper proposes a new framework called Evaluation-Guided Iterative Plan Extraction for long-form narrative text generation (EIPE-text). The key goals and research questions appear to be:

1) How to extract high-quality plans from a corpus of narratives that can help guide the generation of coherent long-form narratives. The paper proposes an iterative extraction and refinement process using QA-based evaluation.

2) How to learn an improved "planner" module specialized for narrative planning, by leveraging the extracted plan corpus. The paper explores both fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. 

3) Evaluating whether the proposed EIPE-text framework can generate more coherent and relevant narratives compared to baseline models, through both automatic and human evaluations.

In summary, the main focus is on developing methods to create better plans to guide long-form text generation, as well as evaluating the proposed framework on metrics like coherence and relevance. The overarching problem is improving LLM-based generation for long narratives.
