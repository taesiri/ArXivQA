# [Effective Adapter for Face Recognition in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01734)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces an effective adapter framework to enhance face recognition performance in real-world conditions involving low-quality probe images. A dual input branch structure with a frozen backbone for low-quality images and trainable adapter for restored high-quality images captures varied feature perspectives while minimizing domain discrepancy. The adapter design leverages fine-tuning, allowing rapid adaptation without losing original model knowledge. A novel fusion module with nested cross- and self-attention integrates the dual features comprehensively. Extensive zero-shot experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate significant boosts of 3-7% in face verification accuracy over competitive baselines, validating the framework's effectiveness and superiority in bridging domain gaps for reliable face recognition, with wide applicability. Key innovations include the dual-branch adapter structure to align image domains, feature fusion technique to enrich representations, and overall plug-and-play design to augment existing recognition models.
