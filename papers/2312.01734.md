## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces an effective adapter framework to enhance face recognition performance in real-world conditions involving low-quality probe images. A dual input branch structure with a frozen backbone for low-quality images and trainable adapter for restored high-quality images captures varied feature perspectives while minimizing domain discrepancy. The adapter design leverages fine-tuning, allowing rapid adaptation without losing original model knowledge. A novel fusion module with nested cross- and self-attention integrates the dual features comprehensively. Extensive zero-shot experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate significant boosts of 3-7% in face verification accuracy over competitive baselines, validating the framework's effectiveness and superiority in bridging domain gaps for reliable face recognition, with wide applicability. Key innovations include the dual-branch adapter structure to align image domains, feature fusion technique to enrich representations, and overall plug-and-play design to augment existing recognition models.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of a novel adapter framework to enhance face recognition in real-world scenarios with low-quality images. The key aspects of this contribution are:

1) The framework leverages a frozen pre-trained model and a trainable adapter to bridge the gap between original low-quality images and enhanced high-quality images restored by face restoration models. 

2) It employs a dual-branch structure to process both low-quality and high-quality images simultaneously.

3) It designs a Fusion Structure with nested Cross-Attention and Self-Attention mechanisms to effectively integrate the features from the two branches.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Face recognition in real-world scenarios, termed "recognition in the wild", poses significant challenges due to the gap between high-quality images used for training and the lower-quality images typically encountered. Real-world images often suffer from distortions and degradations like blurring, negatively impacting the effectiveness of face recognition systems.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an adapter framework integrated with a pre-trained face recognition model to enhance performance on low-quality images. The key is a dual-branch structure:

1) LQ Branch: A frozen, pre-trained model handles the original low-quality images, providing a stable feature extraction baseline.

2) HQ Branch: A trainable adapter processes enhanced high-quality images from a face restoration model, able to adapt and extract distinct features.

A novel fusion module combines features from both branches using nested Cross-Attention and Self-Attention to create an enriched representation.

Main Contributions:

- A novel adapter framework simultaneously processing low-quality and enhanced high-quality images to bridge the gap across image domains.

- An adapter design initializing pre-trained models on high-quality data without losing information. This allows adapting low-quality images quickly without training from scratch.

- Extensive experiments show considerable gains in accuracy and reliability for face recognition in the wild using Cross-Attention and Self-Attention fusion.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective adapter framework to tackle the challenges of face recognition on low-quality images typically encountered in real-world settings. By jointly processing restored and original images in a dual-stream structure, fusing features with attention mechanisms, it enhances recognition performance.
