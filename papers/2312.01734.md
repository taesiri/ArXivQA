# [Effective Adapter for Face Recognition in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01734)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces an effective adapter framework to enhance face recognition performance in real-world conditions involving low-quality probe images. A dual input branch structure with a frozen backbone for low-quality images and trainable adapter for restored high-quality images captures varied feature perspectives while minimizing domain discrepancy. The adapter design leverages fine-tuning, allowing rapid adaptation without losing original model knowledge. A novel fusion module with nested cross- and self-attention integrates the dual features comprehensively. Extensive zero-shot experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate significant boosts of 3-7% in face verification accuracy over competitive baselines, validating the framework's effectiveness and superiority in bridging domain gaps for reliable face recognition, with wide applicability. Key innovations include the dual-branch adapter structure to align image domains, feature fusion technique to enrich representations, and overall plug-and-play design to augment existing recognition models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel face recognition framework with an adapter design that bridges the gap between high-quality gallery images and low-quality probe images in real-world conditions by fusing features from both the original and enhanced images through a structure with nested cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of a novel adapter framework to enhance face recognition in real-world scenarios with low-quality images. The key aspects of this contribution are:

1) The framework leverages a frozen pre-trained model and a trainable adapter to bridge the gap between original low-quality images and enhanced high-quality images restored by face restoration models. 

2) It employs a dual-branch structure to process both low-quality and high-quality images simultaneously.

3) It designs a Fusion Structure with nested Cross-Attention and Self-Attention mechanisms to effectively integrate the features from the two branches.

4) Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve accuracy and reliability in face recognition compared to conventional techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is an adapter-based framework tailored to handle low-quality images in real-world face recognition by fusing features from both original and enhanced images using advanced attention mechanisms. This allows existing recognition models to better adapt to challenging wild environments.
