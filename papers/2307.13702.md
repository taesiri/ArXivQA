# [Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13702)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How faithful is the chain-of-thought reasoning produced by large language models? 

In particular, the authors are investigating whether the step-by-step reasoning generated by LLMs before answering a question accurately represents the model's actual reasoning process for arriving at the answer. They explore several hypotheses for how the chain-of-thought could be unfaithful, such as:

- The reasoning is post-hoc and does not actually influence the model's predictions
- The performance boost comes from increased test-time computation, not the reasoning content 
- The reasoning encodes information in subtle linguistic choices rather than explainable reasoning steps

To test these hypotheses, the authors propose several experiments that intervene on the chain-of-thought, like truncating it or adding mistakes, to see if that changes the model's final answer. They also test the role of model size, evaluating if smaller models produce more faithful reasoning.

Overall, the central research question seems to be assessing the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning across different conditions, to determine if and when LLMs provide accurate explanations through this method of prompting for step-by-step reasoning before answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing and applying tests for measuring the faithfulness of chain of thought reasoning produced by large language models. The key tests proposed are:

- Early answering - Truncating the chain of thought at different points and seeing if the predicted answer changes. If truncating the chain of thought frequently changes the predicted answer, this suggests the full chain of thought causally influences the answer.

- Adding mistakes - Introducing a mistake into the chain of thought and seeing if the predicted answer changes. As above, if the answer changes then the chain of thought seems to causally influence the answer. 

- Filler tokens - Replacing the chain of thought with uninformative filler text to test if additional compute alone accounts for the performance boost.

- Paraphrasing - Rewording the chain of thought to test if particular phrasing choices encode important information. 

These tests are applied across tasks and model sizes to shed light on when and why chain of thought reasoning tends to be more or less faithful. The main findings are:

- There is wide variation in faithfulness across tasks. Logical reasoning tasks tend to show more faithful reasoning.

- Smaller models often produce more faithful reasoning than larger models on the same task.

- The performance boost from chain of thought does not seem attributable to added compute alone or information encoded in precise phrasing.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing concrete tests to measure chain of thought faithfulness, applying these tests to investigate what drives faithfulness, and showing that faithful reasoning is attainable on certain tasks with appropriate model selection.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper: 

The paper investigates the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning generated by large language models on a variety of question answering tasks, finding that reasoning faithfulness varies widely across tasks and decreases with model size, but smaller models can produce more faithful reasoning on some tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several important contributions to research on measuring the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning from large language models:

- It proposes several novel methods for perturbing the chain of thought to test how much the model relies on it, including early answering, adding mistakes, paraphrasing, and filler tokens. These provide defense-in-depth style evidence about different potential ways the reasoning could be unfaithful. 

- It applies these faithfulness measurement methods across a diverse set of question answering tasks and models. This allows the first broad characterization of how reasoning faithfulness varies across settings. The paper finds that faithfulness depends greatly on the task and model capabilities.

- It investigates how model size affects reasoning faithfulness, finding that smaller models often produce more faithful reasoning. This provides guidance on how to choose models more likely to provide faithful explanations.

- The paper comprehensively investigates and provides evidence against several hypotheses for how chain of thought could be unfaithful, like providing extra test-time compute or encoding information in the phrasing.

Other related works have focused more narrowly on analyzing faithfulness in specific contexts. For example:

- Turpin et al. (2023) showed cases of unfaithful reasoning but did not systematically measure faithfulness across tasks.

- Wei et al. (2022) investigated the test-time compute hypothesis but did not propose other faithfulness tests. 

- Gao et al. (2023) and Madaan et al. (2022) analyzed importance of CoT tokens but did not intervene on the CoT like this work does.

Overall, this paper provides the most extensive investigation of reasoning faithfulness under a variety of conditions. The proposed techniques could be widely adopted for analyzing explanations in other contexts beyond chain of thought as well. The findings also point the way forward to designing systems that provide more verifiable explanatory reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions based on the findings and limitations of their work:

- Designing methods to elicit more faithful reasoning from LLMs, such as exploring training schemes other than RLHF that incentivize faithfulness. The metrics proposed in this paper could be used to evaluate faithfulness.

- Additional experiments to investigate other potential causes of unfaithful reasoning beyond those tested here. The "defense-in-depth" approach could be expanded to rule out more possible failure modes. 

- Ground-truth analysis of reasoning process, e.g. by designing simplified reasoning tasks where ground truth is known. This could validate and refine the proposed faithfulness metrics.

- Applying the faithfulness tests to other LLM reasoning methods beyond chain of thought, such as subquestion decomposition. The tests may generalize.

- Exploring whether different models, datasets, or task formats could elicit more reliable reasoning, as they find reasoning faithfulness depends on these factors.

- Developing methods to detect when LLM reasoning is likely to be untrustworthy and should not be relied upon. The faithfulness tests could help train such detectors.

- Analysis of how training approaches beyond RLHF, such as pretrained LLMs, impact reasoning faithfulness. This could reveal architectures or training techniques that improve faithfulness.

Overall, the authors lay groundwork for improving and validating the faithfulness of LLM reasoning through further analysis, model development, new training techniques, and faithfulness detection systems. Their work opens promising avenues for progress towards verifiable and trustworthy reasoning from LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the faithfulness of the reasoning generated by large language models when prompted to provide a "chain of thought" before answering a question. The authors propose several tests to measure faithfulness, such as truncating the chain of thought, adding mistakes to it, and paraphrasing it. They apply these tests across different tasks and model sizes. The results show high variation in faithfulness across tasks - for some tasks the model relies heavily on the chain of thought, while for others it mostly ignores it. The results also indicate that larger models generate less faithful reasoning. Overall, the paper demonstrates that while chain of thought reasoning is not always faithful, it can be under certain conditions like smaller model size and task type. The work opens up future research into designing methods to elicit more faithful reasoning from language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the faithfulness of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning produced by large language models. The authors propose several tests to measure CoT faithfulness, including truncating the CoT early and adding mistakes into the CoT to see if it changes the model's final answer. These tests aim to determine if the stated CoT reasoning is post-hoc justification after the model has already decided on an answer internally. The paper applies these faithfulness tests to CoT from LLMs fine-tuned as helpful assistants, evaluating them on 8 QA datasets. 

The results show large variation in CoT faithfulness across tasks. For some tasks like arithmetic problems, the CoT has very little influence on the final answer, while for others like AQuA algebra problems, adding mistakes to the CoT often changes the final answer. Smaller models tended to have more faithful CoT, suggesting that models should be appropriately sized for a task to produce useful explanations. Overall, the findings indicate that CoT can be faithful in the right circumstances, although models do not always rely on CoT when predicting answers. The proposed metrics offer ways to evaluate and improve reasoning faithfulness in LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes several tests to evaluate the faithfulness of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning generated by large language models. The main tests involve intervening on the CoT in different ways and evaluating whether and how much the model's final predicted answer changes in response. One test truncates the CoT at different points to see if the model still comes to the same conclusion without the full reasoning statement. Another test introduces mistakes into the CoT and evaluates if the model's answer changes. Additional tests replace the CoT with filler text to isolate the effects of increased context length, and paraphrasing the CoT to determine if specific phrasing choices influence the answer. These tests for faithfulness are applied across multiple question answering datasets and model sizes. By analyzing how perturbing the CoT changes model predictions, the tests aim to determine if the stated CoT reasoning provides a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is investigating whether the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning generated by large language models before answering questions is a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process for arriving at the answer. The authors note that CoT reasoning has been claimed to enhance model interpretability, but its faithfulness has been questioned. Thus, the key question is: When large language models generate step-by-step reasoning before answering, is this stated reasoning actually faithful to the true reasoning process the model uses to get the answer?

The paper aims to investigate hypotheses for how the CoT reasoning could be unfaithful, and to measure the faithfulness of CoT reasoning across different tasks and model sizes.
