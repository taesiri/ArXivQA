# [Typographic Attacks in Large Multimodal Models Can be Alleviated by More   Informative Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19150)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) utilize pre-trained vision-language models and leverage large language models as their core. However, they inherit vulnerabilities to "typographic attacks" from the vision-language models, where introducing typos into images can mislead models.  

- This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of typographic attacks on LMMs across various subtasks (object recognition, attribute detection, counting, arithmetic, reasoning) and typographic factors (font size, color, opacity, position).

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

- The authors introduce a "Typographic Dataset" to systematically evaluate LMM distractibility across different subtasks and typographic factors. Experiments show typos significantly reduce model performance. More visible typos are more distracting, but even subtle typos impact accuracy.

- Analysis shows both the vision encoder and LMMs focus more on text than image contents when analyzing typographic images. Further experiments suggest LMMs can partially distinguish between visual content and typos. 

- A key finding is that the reason LMMs struggle is not the vision encoder, but the limited information content of the text prompts. Providing more detailed prompt options allows the vision encoder to better distinguish content vs typos.  

- Finally, the authors propose "more informative prompt guiding" methods to alleviate effects of typographic attacks. Specifically, instructing models to ignore text or eliciting step-by-step rationales improves robustness to typos.

In summary, this is the first paper analyzing typographic attack impacts across modalities/factors in LMMs. Analysis shows issues stem from prompt limitations rather than vision encoders. More informative prompts can mitigate these attacks.
