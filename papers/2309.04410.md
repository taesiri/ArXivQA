# [DeformToon3D: Deformable 3D Toonification from Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04410)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a new method called DeformToon3D for 3D toonification, which is the process of transferring artistic styles onto 3D faces. - The goal is to achieve stylized geometry and texture while preserving the original GAN latent space. This allows compatibility with existing semantic editing tools.- It decomposes the problem into geometry stylization and texture stylization. - For geometry, it introduces a novel StyleField module that predicts a 3D deformation to map points from the stylized space to the real space. This avoids modifying the pre-trained 3D generator.- For texture, it uses adaptive style mixing to inject artistic style information into the 2D decoder module.- It can be trained efficiently using only synthetic paired data without real 2D-3D pairs.- Compared to fine-tuning the full GAN, it better preserves the latent space and is much more storage efficient since only a small StyleField is needed per style.- It enables flexible style control like degree adjustment and shape/texture swapping.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that decomposing 3D toonification into separate geometry and texture stylization sub-problems, along with using a StyleField and adaptive mixing, can achieve high quality results while preserving compatibility with existing GAN tools. This is validated through comparisons to various baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a novel 3D toonification framework called DeformToon3D that can transfer the style of artistic/cartoon domains onto target 3D faces. 2. Decomposing the 3D toonification task into separate subproblems of geometry and texture stylization. This is done to better preserve the original latent space of the pre-trained 3D GAN used.3. Introducing a new "StyleField" module that handles geometry stylization by predicting 3D deformations to transform points from the real to style space. This avoids having to fine-tune the 3D generator.4. Achieving texture stylization via adaptive style mixing that injects artistic domain information into the decoder module of the 3D GAN.5. Enabling flexible control over degree of stylization for both geometry and texture through the proposed framework.6. Allowing training using only synthetic paired data from an off-the-shelf 2D toonification model, avoiding the need for real 2D-3D training pairs.7. Demonstrating that their method preserves the original latent space, enabling downstream tasks like editing and animation that rely on the original GAN space.In summary, the key ideas appear to be decomposing 3D toonification into geometry and texture subproblems, using a StyleField and adaptive style mixing to avoid extensive fine-tuning, and preserving the latent space for downstream tasks. The method seems flexible and efficient while producing high quality stylized 3D faces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes DeformToon3D, a new method for 3D toonification of faces that deforms a neural radiance field from the real image domain to a target artistic style domain using a learned conditional 3D deformation field and adaptive style mixing, avoiding expensive fine-tuning of the full generative model for each new style.
