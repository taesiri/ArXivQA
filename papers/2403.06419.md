# [Causal Multi-Label Feature Selection in Federated Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for multi-label feature selection require centralizing data from multiple sources, which risks privacy leaks. This paper studies the challenging problem of causal multi-label feature selection under a federated learning setting where data remains decentralized across clients.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FedCMFS, a Federated Causal Multi-label Feature Selection algorithm, comprised of three novel components:

1. FedCFL: Considers correlations among labels, features and labels-features to learn candidate parent and child features of each label at each client. Results are aggregated at the server to obtain causally relevant features while preserving privacy.

2. FedCFR: Selectively recovers potential true causally relevant features missed by FedCFL due to correlations between labels. 

3. FedCFC: Removes false causally relevant features from the result of FedCFR using the symmetry property between a variable and its parents/children.


Main Contributions:

- Proposes first algorithm for privacy-preserving causal multi-label feature selection in federated setting.

- Introduces three novel federated learning components tailored for causal discovery - FedCFL, FedCFR and FedCFC.

- Evaluation on 8 datasets shows FedCMFS effectively identifies causal features. Outperforms compared methods on most metrics and datasets.

- Provides interpretability by discovering direct causal relationships between features and labels.

- Preserves privacy by only exchanging conditional independence test statistics between server and clients.

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution in enabling causal feature selection for multi-label data in cross-silo federated learning scenarios while protecting data privacy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated causal multi-label feature selection algorithm called FedCMFS that comprises three novel subroutines to learn relevant features for each label, retrieve missed true relevant features, and remove false relevant features in a privacy-preserving manner across decentralized data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called FedCMFS (Federated Causal Multi-label Feature Selection) for performing causal multi-label feature selection in a federated learning setting. Specifically:

1) FedCMFS proposes a new approach to causal multi-label feature selection that works in a federated learning environment across multiple clients while preserving data privacy. This allows causal feature selection from decentralized datasets without needing to centralize the data.

2) FedCMFS introduces three new subroutines as part of the algorithm: FedCFL for initial causal feature learning, FedCFR for retrieving potentially missed causal features, and FedCFC for correcting likely false causal associations. These provide robust causal feature selection.

3) Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that FedCMFS outperforms existing multi-label feature selection methods adapted to the federated setting. Statistical tests further validate the superiority of FedCMFS.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling privacy-preserving causal multi-label feature selection in a federated environment, through a new algorithm composed of three tailored subroutines for distributed causal discovery and feature selection.
