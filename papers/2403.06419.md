# [Causal Multi-Label Feature Selection in Federated Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for multi-label feature selection require centralizing data from multiple sources, which risks privacy leaks. This paper studies the challenging problem of causal multi-label feature selection under a federated learning setting where data remains decentralized across clients.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FedCMFS, a Federated Causal Multi-label Feature Selection algorithm, comprised of three novel components:

1. FedCFL: Considers correlations among labels, features and labels-features to learn candidate parent and child features of each label at each client. Results are aggregated at the server to obtain causally relevant features while preserving privacy.

2. FedCFR: Selectively recovers potential true causally relevant features missed by FedCFL due to correlations between labels. 

3. FedCFC: Removes false causally relevant features from the result of FedCFR using the symmetry property between a variable and its parents/children.


Main Contributions:

- Proposes first algorithm for privacy-preserving causal multi-label feature selection in federated setting.

- Introduces three novel federated learning components tailored for causal discovery - FedCFL, FedCFR and FedCFC.

- Evaluation on 8 datasets shows FedCMFS effectively identifies causal features. Outperforms compared methods on most metrics and datasets.

- Provides interpretability by discovering direct causal relationships between features and labels.

- Preserves privacy by only exchanging conditional independence test statistics between server and clients.

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution in enabling causal feature selection for multi-label data in cross-silo federated learning scenarios while protecting data privacy.
