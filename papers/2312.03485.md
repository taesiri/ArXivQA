# [Precision of Individual Shapley Value Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03485)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on evaluating the precision of Shapley value explanations on an individual basis for predicting tabular data. Shapley values are commonly used in explainable AI to explain individual predictions made by complex machine learning models by attributing importance scores to input features. The paper demonstrates that across various estimation methods, the Shapley value explanations tend to be less precise for test observations that are further away from the center of the training data distribution. This is expected since the methods have less training data in those regions to learn the feature dependencies. However, the methods still manage to uncover the most influential features. The paper argues that Shapley value practitioners should be more careful in directly applying the estimated attribution values for outliers and instead use them mainly for feature ranking. Overall, the choice of estimation method does impact precision, with parametric methods leveraging distributional assumptions performing the best in the authors' simulation study. The paper provides useful practical insights for applying Shapley values explanations.
