# [The Case for Globalizing Fairness: A Mixed Methods Study on Colonialism,   AI, and Health in Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03357)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models have the potential to propagate biases and unfairness, which is especially concerning for global health applications in Africa.  
- Most algorithmic fairness research has been contextualized to Western notions of discrimination and does not account for unique challenges in Africa related to colonial history, power imbalances between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), etc.
- There is a need to explore fairness attributes and axes of disparities specific to the African context across the ML pipeline from problem formulation to model development and deployment.

Methods:
- The authors conduct a scoping literature review to propose axes of disparities between Africa and the West and within Africa that should be considered for fairness. These include colonial history, national income level, country of origin, race, ethnicity, religion, language, skin tone, gender, literacy/education level, rural/urban location, etc.
- They categorize different types of biases that could result from these axes of disparities.
- 672 general population participants and 28 experts across African countries are surveyed on whether the proposed attributes would cause bias and the impact of colonialism on AI for health in Africa.

Key Findings:
- Most experts indicated the proposed attributes are likely to cause bias in ML models' performance for Africans. General population respondents did not think there would be differential performance.
- 57% of experts saw a link between colonialism and AI in Africa, but only 9% of the general population did. Concerns were around economic dependency, lack of local ownership of AI applications, and mistrust.
- Recommendations include contextualizing fairness criteria; inclusive problem selection; awareness of mistrust; caution in using pretrained models; focus on model generalization and transferability.

Contributions:
- Identification of African-contextualized axes of disparities and connections to potential biases in ML applications for health
- Qualitative study providing evidence on relevance of attributes and impact of colonialism
- Practical recommendations for developing fair ML solutions for health in Africa


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores fairness attributes for machine learning in global health, focusing on Africa as a case study, by proposing axes of disparity, conducting a qualitative study on colonialism's impact on AI for health in Africa, and providing recommendations for developing fair ML solutions for health in Africa.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing axes of disparities between Africa and the West, and global axes of disparities in the context of Africa, identifying fairness attributes that should be considered with respect to Africa, and delineating real world ML for health applications where these should be considered.

2. Conducting a qualitative study on the relevance of these attributes and on the impact of colonialism on the development and deployment of ML systems in health in Africa. 

3. Discussing contextual challenges to the application of ML in health in Africa and providing recommendations for fairness-aware ML solutions for health in Africa.

So in summary, the paper contextualizes fairness for machine learning in global health, using Africa as a case study. It identifies relevant fairness attributes, gathers evidence on their importance through qualitative studies, and provides recommendations for building fair ML solutions for health in the African context.

The paper also provides recommendations for developing fairer ML solutions for health in Africa.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes axes of disparities between Africa and the West. Can you elaborate on why these axes were chosen and how they were identified through the literature review? What other axes could be relevant that were not covered?

2. The paper conducts a qualitative study with experts and general population participants. Can you explain the rationale behind this mixed methods approach? What are the strengths and weaknesses of using both expert interviews and population surveys?  

3. The sample sizes for the expert interviews (n=28) and population surveys (n=672) seem quite different. Can you comment on whether these sample sizes are adequate and what considerations went into determining the target sample size for each study?

4. The paper focuses specifically on colonialism as an attribute of interest. Why was colonialism chosen as the focal point and how does examining this attribute in particular allow the authors to explore the interplay between AI, health, and fairness in Africa?  

5. What types of biases could the self-reported survey methods introduce into the results on perceptions of AI biases and colonialism? How did the authors attempt to mitigate these potential biases?

6. The population survey was conducted exclusively in English. What impact could this have had on the representation of the sample and the generalizability of the results? How could the authors have accounted for linguistic diversity?

7. Participants were financially compensated for the expert interviews. Could this compensation have impacted the results or introduced response biases? How so?

8. The paper categorizes the challenges to developing ML solutions in Africa by health modality (EHRs, medical imaging, etc.). What informed this structure and why is it an effective way to characterize the challenges?

9. The authors provide recommendations for developing fair ML solutions in Africa. Can you explain the rationale and evidence base behind 1-2 of the recommendations? How feasible are they to implement in practice?  

10. What additional analyses could the authors have conducted to further validate the proposed axes of disparities? For example, how could the qualitative results have been triangulated with other data sources?
