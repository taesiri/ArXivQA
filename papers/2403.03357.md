# [The Case for Globalizing Fairness: A Mixed Methods Study on Colonialism,   AI, and Health in Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03357)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models have the potential to propagate biases and unfairness, which is especially concerning for global health applications in Africa.  
- Most algorithmic fairness research has been contextualized to Western notions of discrimination and does not account for unique challenges in Africa related to colonial history, power imbalances between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), etc.
- There is a need to explore fairness attributes and axes of disparities specific to the African context across the ML pipeline from problem formulation to model development and deployment.

Methods:
- The authors conduct a scoping literature review to propose axes of disparities between Africa and the West and within Africa that should be considered for fairness. These include colonial history, national income level, country of origin, race, ethnicity, religion, language, skin tone, gender, literacy/education level, rural/urban location, etc.
- They categorize different types of biases that could result from these axes of disparities.
- 672 general population participants and 28 experts across African countries are surveyed on whether the proposed attributes would cause bias and the impact of colonialism on AI for health in Africa.

Key Findings:
- Most experts indicated the proposed attributes are likely to cause bias in ML models' performance for Africans. General population respondents did not think there would be differential performance.
- 57% of experts saw a link between colonialism and AI in Africa, but only 9% of the general population did. Concerns were around economic dependency, lack of local ownership of AI applications, and mistrust.
- Recommendations include contextualizing fairness criteria; inclusive problem selection; awareness of mistrust; caution in using pretrained models; focus on model generalization and transferability.

Contributions:
- Identification of African-contextualized axes of disparities and connections to potential biases in ML applications for health
- Qualitative study providing evidence on relevance of attributes and impact of colonialism
- Practical recommendations for developing fair ML solutions for health in Africa
