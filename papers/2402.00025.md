# [Accelerating a Triton Fused Kernel for W4A16 Quantized Inference with   SplitK work decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Matrix multiplication for inference workloads tends to be memory bandwidth bound rather than compute bound due to the small batch sizes and matrix dimensions typical of these workloads. 
- Traditional data parallel GPU implementations of GEMM do not fully utilize GPU resources for these "skinny" matrix multiplies.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement a fused dequantization and GEMM kernel using a SplitK decomposition strategy rather than traditional data parallel tiling. 
- SplitK allows for finer-grained decomposition of the workload into smaller tiles, improving load balancing across SMs.
- Implements this using atomic adds for the reductions to synchronize output results across thread blocks.
- Integrates INT4 weight matrix dequantization into the kernel rather than as a separate pre-processing step.

Key Contributions:
- Average 65% speedup on A100 and 124% on H100 compared to data parallel baseline.
- Analysis shows speedups are due to 2x better SM utilization and occupancy, leading to higher memory bandwidth utilization.
- Performs well across a range of matrix sizes representative of transformer models, especially for batch size 1-16.
- Provides optimized implementation in Triton for easy adoption and portability across hardware platforms.
- Analysis provides intuition for SplitK benefits increasing further on future GPUs with more SMs.

In summary, the key innovation is a GPU kernel better optimized for the memory bandwidth bound regime of inference matrix multiplies by using atomic SplitK decomposition to improve resource utilization and memory throughput.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient fused matrix multiplication kernel for quantized inference that performs dequantization and GEMM using a SplitK work decomposition, showing significant speedups for skinny matrix multiplies typical of foundation model inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors propose an implementation of an efficient fused matrix multiplication kernel for W4A16 quantized inference, where they perform dequantization and GEMM in a fused kernel using a SplitK work decomposition. Their implementation shows improvement for the type of skinny matrix-matrix multiplications found in foundation model inference workloads. Specifically, they survey the matrix multiplication between a skinny activation matrix and a square weight matrix, and demonstrate an average of 65% speed improvement on A100 GPUs and an average of 124% speed improvement on H100 GPUs (with a peak of 295%) compared to traditional data parallel decomposition strategies.

In summary, the key contribution is an optimized fused dequantization and GEMM kernel using SplitK decomposition that achieves significant performance gains over traditional approaches for quantized inference workloads involving skinny matrix multiplications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions implementing the kernel in Triton due to its easy-to-use interface and cross-hardware compatibility. What are some of the key benefits and challenges of using Triton compared to other frameworks like CUDA or oneAPI?

2. The SplitK algorithm is inspired by the CUTLASS library. What are some of the key innovations in CUTLASS that enable high-performance GEMM implementations and how are those adapted in the SplitK approach? 

3. The paper argues that SplitK allows for more balanced waves per SM compared to data parallel blocking. Can you explain the concept of wave level parallelism in more detail and why balancing waves is important?

4. When increasing the SplitK parameter from 4 to 16, performance degraded with larger matrix sizes on the A100 GPUs. What is the tradeoff here between finer-grained decomposition and overhead of atomic contention?

5. The paper shows much higher gains for SplitK on the H100 vs the A100 GPUs. Given the architectural differences between these GPUs shown in Table 2, what factors contribute most to these performance deltas?

6. The profiler statistics show SplitK had higher global memory throughput but lower computational intensity than data parallel. How does the algorithm hide latencies to improve throughput despite less arithmetic intensity?

7. With 4x more thread blocks, how does SplitK achieve much lower register and shared memory usage per thread block compared to data parallel? What optimizations enable this?

8. The paper mentions wave quantization inefficiency becoming more problematic on newer GPUs with more SMs. Can you explain this concept and why SplitK helps address it? 

9. For what types of matrix multiplication problems, shapes, and hardware would you expect SplitK to have more or less advantage over standard data parallel GEMM?

10. The paper suggests StreamK could enable finer-grained work decomposition than SplitK. What are the key innovations in StreamK that can improve performance further and what are the implementation challenges?
