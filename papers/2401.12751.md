# [PSDF: Prior-Driven Neural Implicit Surface Learning for Multi-view   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional multi-view surface reconstruction pipelines rely on intermediate representations from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods, which often result in noisy and incomplete geometry. This is because MVS struggles in areas with low texture and varying illumination where photometric consistency is unreliable. Recent neural implicit surface reconstruction (NISR) methods bypass MVS as an intermediate step by directly learning surface representations from images using differentiable rendering. However, existing NISR methods either focus on simple scenes or have difficulties recovering high-quality geometry from complex real-world scenes due to underconstrained optimization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel NISR framework called PSDF that utilizes both external geometric priors from a pretrained MVS network and internal geometric priors inherent in the model itself to facilitate high-quality surface learning. Specifically:

1) A visibility-aware feature consistency loss is introduced to provide robust photoconsistency constraints by leveraging discriminative deep features and visibility information from MVS. 

2) Depth prior-assisted sampling is presented to aid in efficiently locating surface intersection points by using reliable depth estimates from MVS.

3) An internal prior-guided importance rendering technique is developed to mitigate biased surface rendering issues by directing attention to accurately learn colors at surface points.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel prior-driven neural implicit surface learning framework (PSDF) that achieves state-of-the-art multi-view reconstruction, even for complex uncontrolled scenes

- Introduces visibility-aware feature consistency loss and depth prior-assisted sampling based on external MVS priors to significantly enhance reconstruction accuracy  

- Presents internal prior-guided importance rendering to improve surface rendering quality by reducing bias

- Demonstrates excellent performance on complex indoor/outdoor scenes from Tanks and Temples dataset, with over 40% improvement in F1 score compared to prior top method

In summary, the paper exploits both external and internal geometric priors in a novel manner to achieve robust and high-quality surface reconstruction from multi-view images, advancing the state-of-the-art.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing PSDF, a prior-driven neural implicit surface learning method for multi-view reconstruction, which exploits both external and internal geometric priors for high-quality surface reconstruction.

2. Introducing a visibility-aware feature consistency loss and depth prior-assisted sampling, derived from external geometric priors obtained from a pre-trained MVS network. These help improve the precision of recovered surfaces significantly. 

3. Presenting an internal prior-guided importance rendering technique to mitigate the biased surface rendering induced by volume rendering. This helps ensure high-fidelity surface reconstruction.
