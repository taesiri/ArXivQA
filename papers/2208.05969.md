# [Safety and Performance, Why not Both? Bi-Objective Optimized Model   Compression toward AI Software Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Safety and Performance, Why not Both? Bi-Objective Optimized Model Compression toward AI Software Deployment":

Problem:
- Deep learning models are rapidly increasing in size, making deployment on resource-constrained devices like smartphones very difficult. 
- Model compression techniques like pruning and knowledge distillation can reduce model size but may inherit vulnerabilities from the original big model.
- Compressed models face even higher attack risks when deployed on many edge devices compared to big models on servers.
- Existing solutions apply model compression and defense separately, lacking consideration of their interaction.

Proposed Solution:
- A test-driven sparse training framework called "SafeCompress" for safe model compression, optimizing both performance and safety. 
- Simulates attack mechanism during compression to defend against it. Applicable to different attacks via configuration.
- Iteratively updates compression strategies based on performance and safety tests to get the best sparse model.

Main Contributions:
- One of the first works to study the safe model compression problem critical for AI software deployment.
- Proposes the general SafeCompress framework that can optimize performance and safety simultaneously. Easily configurable for different attacks.
- Implements a variant called MIA-SafeCompress against membership inference attacks (MIAs). Adds entropy regularization to improve safety.
- Experiments on 5 datasets for computer vision and NLP tasks show superiority over combining separate compression and defense methods.
- Discusses adapting framework to other attacks like white-box MIA. Opens up future work on benchmarking model tradeoffs.

In summary, this paper identifies the emerging issue of model vulnerabilities persisting after compression, and proposes a test-driven approach to compress models safely while retaining performance. The configurable framework and promising results demonstrate this is an important direction for practical AI software deployment.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a test-driven sparse training framework called SafeCompress that can automatically compress a big deep learning model into a small one with optimized performance and safety against membership inference attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution can be summarized as follows:

1. This is one of the first efforts toward the problem of "safe model compression", which is critical for today's large-scale AI software deployment on edge devices like smartphones. The paper proposes a general framework called "SafeCompress" to address this problem.

2. The SafeCompress framework can be configured to protect against a pre-specified attack mechanism. It adopts a test-driven process to iteratively update the model compression strategies to co-optimize model performance and safety.

3. Considering membership inference attack (MIA) as a representative attack, the paper develops a concrete instance of SafeCompress called MIA-SafeCompress. It also proposes an entropy-based regularizer to enhance model safety against MIA.

4. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets for both computer vision and natural language processing tasks verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method MIA-SafeCompress.

5. The paper discusses how to adapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides MIA, demonstrating the flexibility of the SafeCompress framework.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the SafeCompress framework to address the safe model compression problem from a performance-safety co-optimization perspective, and developing a concrete method MIA-SafeCompress as a showcase to demonstrate its effectiveness.
