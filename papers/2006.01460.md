# [Situated and Interactive Multimodal Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01460)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the key research focus:

The paper introduces a new task of Situated Interactive MultiModal Conversations (SIMMC) aimed at building next generation virtual assistants that can handle evolving multimodal inputs and actions grounded in a shared, co-evolving context. 

The central hypothesis is that task-oriented dialog agents need to be able to process multimodal inputs (e.g. vision, dialog history, user utterances) and execute multimodal actions (e.g. manipulate objects in a 3D environment, highlight images) that are situated within and dynamically update a shared multimodal context. 

To study this hypothesis, the paper presents two new multimodal dialog datasets collected using a Wizard-of-Oz setup - SIMMC-Furniture grounded in a shared VR environment, and SIMMC-Fashion grounded in a stream of images.

The key research questions addressed using these datasets are:

- How to model task-oriented dialog agents that can understand user requests and intents based on both dialog history and a situated multimodal context? 

- How to generate system responses and actions that manipulate the shared multimodal context in a meaningful way?

- How to build systems that can track dialog state and coreferences across modalities over multiple turns?

The paper proposes several tasks like action prediction, response generation and dialog state tracking on the datasets to study these questions. It also provides baseline results using adaptations of existing models like memory networks, transformers etc.

In summary, the central focus is on studying situated, interactive multimodal conversations where the dialog is grounded in an evolving, shared multimodal context, which is hypothesized to be important for building real-world assistants. The new datasets and tasks are proposed to facilitate research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of Situated Interactive MultiModal Conversations (SIMMC) as a new research direction towards building next-generation virtual assistants that can handle evolving multimodal inputs and contexts. 

2. The creation of two new multimodal dialog datasets collected using a Wizard-of-Oz setup: SIMMC-Furniture (grounded in a shared virtual environment) and SIMMC-Fashion (grounded in a shared set of images). The datasets consist of around 13k human-human dialogs comprising 169k utterances.

3. A novel SIMMC dialog annotation schema that provides semantic annotations like contextual NLU, NLG, coreference etc. using a unified ontology for user and assistant utterances. This enables richer grounding of conversations in the shared multimodal context.

4. Formulation of several tasks within the SIMMC framework like assistant API prediction, response generation, dialog state tracking etc. that can leverage the collected datasets. Strong initial baselines are presented using adaptations of existing models.

5. Public release of the datasets, annotation schema, models and leaderboards to facilitate further research in this new direction at the intersection of dialog systems and multimodal machine learning.

In summary, the paper aims to catalyze the development of next-gen assistants that can perceive and interact with users in multimodal environments, by providing novel multimodal corpora, annotations, tasks and baselines as a unified framework. The key novelty lies in the situated, interactive nature of the dialogs grounded in dynamically evolving multimodal contexts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces two new multimodal dialog datasets for situated conversations grounded in evolving visual contexts, along with a flexible annotation framework, tasks, and benchmark results using adaptations of existing dialog models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in multimodal conversational AI:

- It presents two new multimodal conversation datasets (SIMMC-Furniture and SIMMC-Fashion) that have rich semantic annotations and focus on task-oriented dialog grounded in a shared, evolving multimodal context. Most prior multimodal dialog datasets lack detailed semantic annotations and focus on question answering rather than goal-driven tasks.

- The datasets were collected via a Wizard-of-Oz setup between human pairs to obtain natural conversational flow. Other datasets often rely on crowdworkers and less naturalistic prompts.

- It defines new tasks and metrics around multimodal dialog including API call prediction, contextual response generation, dialog state tracking. These move beyond basic Q&A to capture key capabilities needed for assistant agents.

- An ontology and annotation schema was developed to capture dialog acts, semantic frames, coreference etc. in a unified way across user and assistant. This enables fine-grained semantic modeling.

- The paper adapts state-of-the-art dialog models as baselines for the new datasets and tasks. The models incorporate multimodal fusion and belief tracking modules in addition to dialog history encoding.

- Compared to visual dialog datasets that use static images, SIMMC incorporates an evolving multimodal context via VR scenes and highlighted images that get updated based on dialog history and API calls.

Overall, SIMMC pushes multimodal dialog research towards more flexible, natural, semantic and task-oriented conversations grounded in an interactive situated context shared between user and agent. This moves the field closer to real-world applications compared to prior multimodal dialog datasets and models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing end-to-end dialog models that can leverage the rich semantic annotations in the SIMMC datasets, beyond just adapting existing dialog models. The annotations like dialog acts, intents, slots etc. capture important semantic relationships that current models do not fully utilize.

- Exploring semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches for SIMMC tasks, to reduce reliance on large labeled datasets. The authors suggest pre-training on unlabeled data as one possible direction.

- Studying personalization in SIMMC based on long-term user interactions and profiles. The current work focuses on single dialog interactions. 

- Extending SIMMC to related domains beyond shopping, such as travel booking, technical support etc. The proposed framework is domain-agnostic.

- Supporting clarification dialogs within SIMMC when the assistant is unsure of user intent. The current datasets assume perfect understanding.

- Incorporating natural language generation and dialog policies more tightly into SIMMC response models. The current work focuses more on retrieval. 

- Enabling real-time multimodal context updates during live human-assistant interactions. The offline setting can be restrictive.

- Exploring cross-modal grounding between text, images, speech and other modalities like gestures. The current datasets are text-based.

In summary, the authors propose many interesting avenues to advance SIMMC research, like leveraging semantic annotations better, supporting more modalities, personalization, domain extension, clarification dialogs and live interactions. Advancing these could move SIMMC closer to real-world assistants.

The paper introduces Situated Interactive MultiModal Conversations (SIMMC) as a new research direction for building next generation virtual assistants that can handle evolving multimodal inputs and perform multimodal actions during conversations. The authors collected two new datasets totaling ~13k dialogs using a multimodal Wizard-of-Oz setup to simulate interactive shopping scenarios grounded in shared visual contexts. The Furniture dataset is based in a 3D virtual environment where the assistant can manipulate objects, while the Fashion dataset uses a sequence of product images. Both datasets include detailed semantic annotations like dialog acts and coreferences to support research on contextual language understanding and multimodal dialog state tracking.
