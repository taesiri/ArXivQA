# [CRM: Single Image to 3D Textured Mesh with Convolutional Reconstruction   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-quality 3D shapes from images remains challenging, especially in terms of texture and geometry quality as well as inference speed. Existing transformer-based feedforward models like LRM struggle to fully utilize geometric priors and require extensive compute for training.

Method:
The paper proposes a Convolutional Reconstruction Model (CRM) that leverages the inherent spatial alignment between input multi-view images and output triplane features. 

Key ideas:

1) Uses a multi-view diffusion model to generate 6 orthogonal views and canonical coordinate maps (CCMs) from an input image. This aligns well with triplane structure.

2) Feeds the images and CCMs into a UNet which preserves spatial correspondence to output a high-res triplane. UNet has more capacity to retain input details. 

3) Uses Flexicubes grid as geometry representation for end-to-end mesh optimization. Allows gradients to be directly optimized on mesh.

4) Overall model is trained with a combination of MSE, LPIPS, depth and mask losses between rendered views of generated and ground truth meshes.

Main Results:

- CRM generates high fidelity textured meshes from images in 10 seconds without test-time optimization, faster than previous methods.

- Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show CRM significantly outperforms previous feedforward (LRM, TGS) and optimization-based (DreamFusion, ProlificDreamer) methods in terms of texture and geometry quality.

- Easier to train than transformers, with reasonable reconstruction arising early in training. Entire model trains with 8 GPUs in 6 days, 1/8th the cost of LRM.

Main limitations are consistency of input views affecting quality, and grid size limiting geometric details.
