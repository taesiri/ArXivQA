# [CRM: Single Image to 3D Textured Mesh with Convolutional Reconstruction   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-quality 3D shapes from images remains challenging, especially in terms of texture and geometry quality as well as inference speed. Existing transformer-based feedforward models like LRM struggle to fully utilize geometric priors and require extensive compute for training.

Method:
The paper proposes a Convolutional Reconstruction Model (CRM) that leverages the inherent spatial alignment between input multi-view images and output triplane features. 

Key ideas:

1) Uses a multi-view diffusion model to generate 6 orthogonal views and canonical coordinate maps (CCMs) from an input image. This aligns well with triplane structure.

2) Feeds the images and CCMs into a UNet which preserves spatial correspondence to output a high-res triplane. UNet has more capacity to retain input details. 

3) Uses Flexicubes grid as geometry representation for end-to-end mesh optimization. Allows gradients to be directly optimized on mesh.

4) Overall model is trained with a combination of MSE, LPIPS, depth and mask losses between rendered views of generated and ground truth meshes.

Main Results:

- CRM generates high fidelity textured meshes from images in 10 seconds without test-time optimization, faster than previous methods.

- Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show CRM significantly outperforms previous feedforward (LRM, TGS) and optimization-based (DreamFusion, ProlificDreamer) methods in terms of texture and geometry quality.

- Easier to train than transformers, with reasonable reconstruction arising early in training. Entire model trains with 8 GPUs in 6 days, 1/8th the cost of LRM.

Main limitations are consistency of input views affecting quality, and grid size limiting geometric details.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a convolutional reconstruction model called CRM that generates high-fidelity textured meshes from a single image in 10 seconds by leveraging spatial alignment between input images and output triplanes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Convolutional Reconstruction Model (CRM) for generating high-fidelity 3D textured meshes from a single image in a fast feed-forward manner. Specifically:

1) It proposes to use six orthographic images as input instead of arbitrary views, as they align well spatially with the triplane structure used for 3D representation. 

2) It utilizes a UNet-based convolutional network to transform the input images into a triplane output. This leverages the strong pixel-level alignment and provides high bandwidth to preserve details.

3) It adds Canonical Coordinate Maps (CCMs) as additional input to provide useful geometric information. 

4) It adopts Flexicubes as the 3D representation, which allows end-to-end optimization on textured meshes.

5) The model is easy to train and converges much faster than previous transformer-based methods. It can generate reasonable results after only 20 minutes of training.

6) Overall, the model can generate high quality textured meshes from a single image in around 10 seconds, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.
