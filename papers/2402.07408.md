 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical and modular prompt generation algorithm called Hybrid Prompt. Can you explain in more detail how this modular design allows for scalability and addition of new escape methods? 

2. The paper utilizes the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) paradigm for search space exploration. How does ToT compare to Chain of Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency (SC) in terms of handling the complex reasoning required for webshell escape sample generation?

3. The Few-shot Chain of Examples (Fe) is utilized to guide the language model's reasoning process. In your opinion, what are the key considerations when designing effective Fe chains? How can the quality and diversity of samples generated be further improved?  

4. Contextual Memory Range is defined to constrain the local memory capacity of language models during Hybrid Prompt execution. What are the trade-offs in determining an optimal Contextual Memory Range? How does this compare to techniques like truncated backpropagation?

5. Can you suggest some advanced information compression techniques that can be used to retain key information about large webshell candidates during the voting process? How can loss of original code information be minimized?

6. The paper sets number of candidates p=1 by default. Provide an analysis on the impact of a higher p value on metrics like Escape Rate (ER) and Survival Rate (SR). What considerations should guide selection of an optimal p value?  

7. Escape Rate (ER) is used as one evaluation metric. Can you suggest other metrics that can provide a multi-dimensional estimate of the quality and resilience of generated escape samples? What are the challenges in defining these metrics?

8. How suitable is the Hybrid Prompt algorithm for other types of malicious scripts like malware and viruses? What customizations would be required before application to other domains?

9. The paper identifies lack of publicly available webshell datasets as a challenge. Other than increased sample count, what other properties should an ideal webshell dataset have to accurately benchmark detection methods?

10. Language models still rely heavily on few-shot examples for effective reasoning. In your opinion, what techniques can reduce this dependency and improve the autonomous reasoning capability of models on specialized tasks like webshell generation?
