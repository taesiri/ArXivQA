# [Large Language Models are Few-shot Generators: Proposing Hybrid Prompt   Algorithm To Generate Webshell Escape Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Webshell attacks pose a serious threat to web security, but research on webshell detection is still in early stages due to lack of benchmark datasets and over-reliance on manual rules for sample generation. 
- Existing webshell datasets have obvious malicious features and models tested on them show high accuracy via overfitting. But their authenticity and generalization ability are difficult to guarantee.  
- There is an urgent need for advanced webshell escape sample generation algorithms and corresponding benchmark datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Hybrid Prompt algorithm that combines various prompt strategies like Tree/Chain of Thoughts, few-shot learning to generate high-quality webshell escape samples using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- The algorithm has a hierarchical modular structure covering numerous escape keywords and methods. It designs customized few-shot example chains and tailored strategies for small and large webshells.  
- Constraints and safeguards are added to ensure functionality and improve survival rate of samples.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of Hybrid Prompt algorithm for LLM-based webshell escape sample generation.
- Construction of a benchmark webshell dataset with high Escape and Survival Rates.
- Investigation of multiple LLM models shows samples have 88.61% Escape Rate on VirusTotal, surpassing other methods.
- Confirmation of LLMs potential for webshell domain tasks, setting stage for future LLM-based detection research.
- Algorithm shows strong scalability to add more modules and expand to more languages.

In summary, the paper explores an uncharted area of using LLMs for generating advanced webshell escape samples, proposes an effective prompt algorithm, and constructs a valuable benchmark dataset to promote future research.
