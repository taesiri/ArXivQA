# [Efficient data selection employing Semantic Similarity-based Graph   Structures for model training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training complex AI models like automated speech recognition (ASR) requires large amounts of data, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. 
- Low-resource languages lack sufficient annotated data to train accurate ASR models. Common data augmentation techniques like text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis add to computational costs.
- There is a need for efficient data sampling methods that can select the most salient data points for model training without intensive audio processing.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SeSaME - a semantics-based graph approach to estimate ASR model performance on new data using only textual information. 
- A graph is constructed where nodes are textual utterances, edges connect semantically similar utterances, and labels indicate ASR performance (WER).
- A graph neural network (GNN) is trained on this graph to predict ASR performance of new textual data based on similarity to existing nodes. 
- The GNN predictions are used to sample salient utterances to fine-tune the ASR model without needing to synthesize audio.

Key Contributions:
- Novel GNN-based approach to predict ASR performance purely from textual semantics without audio processing
- Method to leverage GNN predictions to efficiently select important data points for ASR model fine-tuning 
- Experiments showing GNNs can predict difficulty of new textual data for ASR with high accuracy
- Results demonstrating improved ASR performance when fine-tuning on GNN-sampled data over random sampling
- Up to 7% lower WER achieved using graph-based salient data selection for ASR fine-tuning

The key insight is using semantic graph structures to estimate ASR model performance on new textual data in order to select the most informative data points for efficient ASR fine-tuning.
