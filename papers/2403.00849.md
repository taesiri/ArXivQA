# [NeuraLUT: Hiding Neural Network Density in Boolean Synthesizable   Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational complexity and footprint. Custom hardware accelerators like FPGAs can improve performance but typically sacrifice accuracy.
- Prior FPGA-based DNN accelerators using lookup tables (LUTs) like LogicNets and PolyLUT have limitations in fully utilizing the LUTs' representation power. They map only single neurons with linear/polynomial operations into each LUT.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes NeuraLUT, which maps entire sub-networks with arbitrary topologies into LUTs instead of just single neurons. This allows greater precision and function expressibility within the LUTs.
- The sub-networks use dense, full precision layers internally but have quantized inputs/outputs to limit LUT size. Residual connections are added within sub-networks to enable training deeper models.  
- At the circuit-level, NeuraLUT uses expander graph theory like LogicNets to limit fan-in and bit-width between sub-networks, keeping overall model sparse.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces concept of hiding dense, arbitrary sub-networks inside LUTs instead of just single neurons. Enables reduced latency and higher accuracy.
- Mitigates training challenges for deeper sub-networks by using residual connections.
- Validation on jet substructure and MNIST classification tasks shows 1.3-5x lower latency over prior arts with similar or better accuracy.
- Reductions in area-delay product on MNIST (1.7-75x vs. PolyLUT, FINN, hls4ml) and jet tagging (2.2-35x vs. PolyLUT, LogicNets).

In summary, NeuraLUT pushes FPGA-based DNN acceleration by enhancing representation power of LUTs through sub-network mapping. This facilitates highly efficient implementations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NeuraLUT, a method to map dense and full-precision neural network sub-networks into Boolean lookup table functions while enforcing sparsity and quantization only between these sub-networks, enabling higher network expressibility and lower latency compared to prior FPGA LUT-based neural network acceleration techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing NeuraLUT, a novel framework for mapping entire sub-networks of arbitrary topology (rather than just individual neurons) into lookup tables (LUTs) to accelerate deep neural network inference on FPGAs. Specifically:

- They introduce the idea of hiding dense, full-precision sub-networks inside LUTs, while keeping the overall circuit-level network sparse and low-precision. This allows greater function expressivity and accuracy while maintaining hardware efficiency.

- They use skip connections within the sub-networks to mitigate issues like vanishing gradients during training of deeper sub-networks.

- Experiments on tasks like jet substructure tagging and MNIST digit classification demonstrate that NeuraLUT can achieve much lower latency and better area-delay efficiency compared to prior LUT-based works like LogicNets and PolyLUT, while preserving accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is the concept and framework of NeuraLUT that enables hiding complex and deep sub-network functions inside FPGA LUTs to accelerate neural network inference with improved accuracy and hardware efficiency tradeoffs.
