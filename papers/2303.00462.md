# [Hidden Gems: 4D Radar Scene Flow Learning Using Cross-Modal Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00462)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:How to effectively learn 4D radar scene flow estimation without requiring manual annotations, by exploiting supervision signals from other co-located sensors (e.g. odometer, LiDAR, camera) on autonomous vehicles?The key hypothesis is that by opportunistically retrieving and combining complementary supervision cues from heterogeneous on-vehicle sensors, the radar scene flow estimation model can be trained in a cross-modal supervised manner, without needing costly human labeling efforts.In summary, the paper explores using cross-modal supervision from co-located sensors to enable unsupervised learning of radar scene flow, instead of relying on manual annotations or purely self-supervised techniques. The core research contribution is the proposed method to extract and fuse useful supervision signals across different modalities to guide the training process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel approach for 4D radar-based scene flow estimation using cross-modal learning. Previous works have focused on using LiDAR or stereo image data for scene flow estimation. This is the first work to explore using 4D radar data, which is becoming increasingly common on autonomous vehicles due to its robustness in poor weather/lighting conditions. 2. The key idea is to leverage supervision signals from co-located heterogeneous sensors (odometer, LiDAR, camera) on an autonomous vehicle to train the radar scene flow model, without requiring manual annotation of the radar data. This allows exploiting the redundancy in perception systems on modern vehicles.3. A multi-task neural network architecture and associated loss functions are introduced to effectively integrate the cross-modal supervision signals for model training. The model outputs include scene flow, motion segmentation, and ego-motion estimation.4. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset for radar scene flow estimation. The approach also shows benefits for downstream tasks like motion segmentation and odometry. In summary, the main novelty is in exploiting cross-modal redundancy on autonomous vehicles for self-supervised 4D radar scene flow learning, eliminating the need for expensive manual annotation. The multi-task architecture and methodology to effectively integrate heterogeneous sensor signals are also key contributions.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach for 4D radar-based scene flow estimation that leverages cross-modal supervision from co-located sensors like odometer, LiDAR, and camera on autonomous vehicles, removing the need for manual annotation while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work in 4D radar scene flow estimation:- This is the first work using cross-modal supervision for 4D radar scene flow learning. Previous works use either full supervision with manual annotations or self-supervision with only radar data. This paper shows a new direction by exploiting supervision signals from co-located sensors like odometer, LiDAR, and camera.- Compared to fully supervised methods, this approach does not require expensive human annotations for training data. It opportunistically utilizes the sensing redundancy in autonomous vehicles to provide "free" supervision.- Compared to self-supervised methods, this approach can achieve better performance by using real cross-modal signals, instead of only relying on weak self-supervision from radar data. For example, it outperforms the prior self-supervised radar scene flow method RaFlow by 37.6% in EPE.- This approach enables radar scene flow learning using a large amount of unannotated data. It is shown that the performance continues to improve as more raw data is added, surpassing even state-of-the-art supervised methods.- The multi-task model proposed can jointly predict scene flow, ego-motion, and motion segmentation. Unlike some prior works that only focus on scene flow, this enables application to downstream tasks like odometry estimation.- This work provides a new perspective on how to effectively use cross-modal data available in autonomous vehicles. The idea of opportunistically mining signals from complementary sensors could inspire more future research leveraging multi-sensor platforms.In summary, the key novelty and contributions are in exploiting cross-modal supervision from readily available sensor suites on vehicles, bypassing the need for manual annotation. This opens up new possibilities for accurate and scalable radar scene flow learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on the paper, some potential future research directions include:- Applying the cross-modal supervision idea to other sensing modalities beyond radar, LiDAR, camera, and odometry. The authors suggest exploring supervision signals from additional on-vehicle sensors like ultrasonics. - Investigating how to better handle noise and inaccuracies in the cross-modal supervision signals. As noted in the paper, signals like optical flow and LiDAR object detection can be noisy. Developing methods to filter or refine these signals could improve results.- Exploring how to extract and apply cross-modal supervision for video input instead of just pairs of point clouds. Video could provide more temporal context.- Leveraging unlabeled real-world driving datasets with diverse weather conditions to improve generalization.- Applying the estimated radar scene flow to more downstream tasks like tracking, motion forecasting, and prediction. Evaluating usefulness for higher-level autonomy functions.- Adapting the approach to different radar configurations, like imaging radar with more points.- Investigating end-to-end joint perception and scene flow estimation using raw sensor data as input.- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised techniques to extract useful supervision signals directly from the radar data itself, reducing reliance on other sensors.In summary, the main directions are extending cross-modal supervision to new sensors and data types, handling supervision signal noise, and applying scene flow to downstream tasks. Reducing the need for other sensor modalities is also noted as an important goal.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach for 4D radar-based scene flow estimation using cross-modal learning. Motivated by the co-located redundant sensing on autonomous vehicles, the method exploits supervision signals from other on-board sensors like odometer, LiDAR, and camera to train a multi-task neural network model for radar scene flow estimation. It introduces a two-stage architecture with a backbone feature encoder followed by heads for initial flow, motion segmentation, ego-motion estimation, and flow refinement. The training is supervised by an overall loss function composed of an ego-motion loss using odometry, a segmentation loss using fused data from odometer and LiDAR, and a flow loss using constraints from LiDAR and camera. Experiments on a public dataset show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach over baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of opportunistically utilizing cross-modal signals to learn accurate radar scene flow without human annotation. The learned model also improves performance on downstream tasks like motion segmentation and ego-motion estimation.
