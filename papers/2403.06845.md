## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating diverse and high-quality driving videos is crucial for training autonomous vehicles, but remains challenging. Existing world models rely heavily on structured conditions like 3D boxes or image frames, limiting diversity and interactivity. 

Proposed Solution - DriveDreamer-2:
This paper proposes DriveDreamer-2, the first world model capable of generating customized driving videos based on user text prompts. It features three key components:

1. Customized Traffic Simulation: Converts user text into agent trajectories using a finetuned language model, then generates matching HDMaps using a conditional diffusion model. This creates diverse structured conditions.

2. Unified Multi-View Video Model (UniMVM): Unifies intra- and inter-view consistency in the generated multi-view videos, enhancing overall temporal and spatial coherence. 

3. Built on DriveDreamer: Leverages the DriveDreamer framework to generate high-quality, multi-view driving videos conditioned on the simulated structured data.

Main Contributions:

- First world model to generate customizable driving videos from user text prompts in a user-friendly manner
- Proposes traffic simulation pipeline to create structured conditions from text prompts 
- Introduces UniMVM to improve multi-view video consistency
- Generates videos that improve performance of downstream tasks like detection and tracking
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 30% better FID and 50% better FVD than previous methods

In summary, DriveDreamer-2 pioneers user-customized driving video generation through innovative traffic simulation and consistency modeling components. It generates high-quality and diverse videos that advance autonomy research.
