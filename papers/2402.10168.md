# [DeepSRGM -- Sequence Classification and Ranking in Indian Classical   Music with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Raga recognition is an important task in Indian Classical Music (ICM). Raga provides the melodic framework for compositions and improvisations. Automatic raga recognition can help in tasks like organizing music collections and content-based music recommendation systems. 
- Raga recognition is challenging as ragas with similar notes can sound very different due to differences in gamaka (oscillations, slides between notes), arohana/avarohana (ascending/descending note sequences), emphasis and phrases.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors reformulate raga recognition as a sequence classification problem using deep learning. 
- The pitch sequence obtained from the melody of audio recordings is treated as a sequence over time. Ragas are viewed as classes. 
- A LSTM RNN model with attention mechanism (called SRGM1) is used for sequence classification. 
- The same model is fine-tuned with triplet margin loss for a sequence ranking task (called SRGM2). This allows finding melodic patterns in a database closest to a given query sequence.

Key Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.1% on 10 raga classification subset and 88.1% accuracy on 40 raga classification task of Comp Music Carnatic Dataset using SRGM1, improving prior art.
- Introduces sequence ranking for raga recognition using SRGM2, which can help build content-based recommendation systems.
- Overcomes limitations of prior work that uses hand-crafted features or ignores temporal sequence information.
- Demonstrates the applicability of deep learning for ICM related MIR tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a deep learning approach using LSTM recurrent neural networks for Raga recognition in Indian classical music, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on a dataset of Carnatic music recordings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting a new approach to Raga recognition using deep learning and LSTM based RNN architecture to address the problem of Raga recognition. 

2) Achieving state-of-the-art results on the Comp Music Carnatic dataset, with 97.1% accuracy on the 10 Raga classification task and 88.1% accuracy on the 40 Raga classification task.

3) Introducing sequence ranking as a new subtask of Raga recognition, which can be used to create Raga content based recommendation systems.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a deep learning method for Raga recognition that achieves new state-of-the-art results, and introducing sequence ranking for Raga content-based retrieval.

- Raga recognition
- Sequence classification
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

- Precision at top-k

The paper focuses on using deep learning techniques like LSTM RNNs and attention to reformulate the problem of raga recognition in Indian classical music as a sequence classification task. Key aspects include preprocessing steps like audio separation, pitch tracking, tonic normalization, and random sampling of subsequences. Both a sequence classification model (SRGM1) and a sequence ranking model (SRGM2) are presented. Evaluation is done on the Comp Music Carnatic Dataset, and state-of-the-art results are achieved. The idea of using the trained models for content-based retrieval of melodic patterns is also introduced. So these are some of the main keywords and terms that summarize the key technical contributions of this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that Raga recognition is closely related to the task of sequence classification. Can you elaborate on why viewing Raga recognition as a sequence classification problem is more suitable compared to viewing it as a distribution-based classification problem?

2. One of the key preprocessing steps is audio source separation using deep learning. What are some of the advantages of using this approach over more traditional signal processing techniques for source separation? How does it impact the overall raga recognition pipeline?

3. The paper employs an LSTM-RNN architecture with attention for raga recognition. Can you explain why this architecture is well-suited for modeling sequences in music data compared to other sequence modeling approaches like HMMs or CNNs? 

4. The use of subsequence sampling during training is an important aspect of the method. What are some of the motivations and advantages of using subsequence sampling? How is the appropriate subsequence length determined?

5. The paper introduces sequence ranking as a new subtask of raga recognition. Can you conceptually explain how the sequence ranking model works? What modifications need to be made to the classification model to obtain the ranking model? 

6. One of the evaluation metrics used is precision@k for the ranking model. Why is this an appropriate metric compared to classification accuracy? What are some other metrics that could potentially be used to evaluate the ranking model?

7. The method seems to perform very well on the Carnatic music dataset. Do you think the performance would carry over on other genres of Indian classical music like Hindustani or would additional tuning/modification be required?

8. The ranking model is currently tuned to retrieve sequences belonging to the same raga. Can you think of ways in which it can be modified to allow retrieval based on emotion or other aspects beyond just raga?

9. The pretrained models made available could enable several downstream applications. Can you conceptualize some potential applications that could directly benefit from the availability of these models? 

10. The method still does not achieve 100% accuracy on raga recognition. What are some ways in which the recognition accuracy could be further improved in future work?
