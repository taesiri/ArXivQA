# Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient   Optimization

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we build language agents that can iteratively improve their performance based on rewards/feedback from the environment, without directly training or propagating gradients through a large frozen language model?The key hypothesis seems to be that training a "retrospective" model to refine the prompts/instructions given to the large frozen language model actor can serve as a proxy for more direct reinforcement learning, and allow the overall agent to learn from environmental rewards.In summary, the central research goal is developing methods to train language agents to complete tasks better over time by learning from environment feedback, without directly modifying inaccessible large language models. The core proposed approach involves training a small retrospective model to refine prompts using policy gradient optimization as a proxy for full reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The paper introduces Retroformer, a framework for iteratively improving large language agents by learning a plug-in retrospective model. This retrospective model automatically refines the prompts given to the language agent based on feedback from the environment, in order to improve learning speed and task completion. 2. The approach takes a policy gradient approach, with the actor LLM being part of the environment. This allows learning from a wide range of reward signals across diverse tasks and environments. 3. The method focuses on enhancing the retrospective model in the agent architecture, without needing to access or propagate gradients through the actor LLM parameters. This makes it an agnostic, flexible plug-in module that can work with different cloud-based LLMs like GPT or Bard.4. Experiments on environments like HotPotQA demonstrate that Retroformer agents learn faster and achieve better task completion than baselines without gradient-based learning like Reflexion. The results show the promise of using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Retroformer, a novel framework to iteratively improve large language agents using a plug-in retrospective model optimized with policy gradients, without needing to access or train the main actor LLM. The results demonstrate the potential of applying reinforcement learning techniques to language agent architectures.
