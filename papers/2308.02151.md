# [Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02151)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we build language agents that can iteratively improve their performance based on rewards/feedback from the environment, without directly training or propagating gradients through a large frozen language model?The key hypothesis seems to be that training a "retrospective" model to refine the prompts/instructions given to the large frozen language model actor can serve as a proxy for more direct reinforcement learning, and allow the overall agent to learn from environmental rewards.In summary, the central research goal is developing methods to train language agents to complete tasks better over time by learning from environment feedback, without directly modifying inaccessible large language models. The core proposed approach involves training a small retrospective model to refine prompts using policy gradient optimization as a proxy for full reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The paper introduces Retroformer, a framework for iteratively improving large language agents by learning a plug-in retrospective model. This retrospective model automatically refines the prompts given to the language agent based on feedback from the environment, in order to improve learning speed and task completion. 2. The approach takes a policy gradient approach, with the actor LLM being part of the environment. This allows learning from a wide range of reward signals across diverse tasks and environments. 3. The method focuses on enhancing the retrospective model in the agent architecture, without needing to access or propagate gradients through the actor LLM parameters. This makes it an agnostic, flexible plug-in module that can work with different cloud-based LLMs like GPT or Bard.4. Experiments on environments like HotPotQA demonstrate that Retroformer agents learn faster and achieve better task completion than baselines without gradient-based learning like Reflexion. The results show the promise of using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Retroformer, a novel framework to iteratively improve large language agents using a plug-in retrospective model optimized with policy gradients, without needing to access or train the main actor LLM. The results demonstrate the potential of applying reinforcement learning techniques to language agent architectures.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a framework called Retroformer for iteratively improving large language agent models by learning a plug-in retrospective model. The retrospective model automatically refines the prompts given to the language agent based on feedback from the environment, using a policy gradient approach. This allows the agent to learn from a wide range of rewards across diverse tasks and environments. The retrospective model focuses on analyzing failures in previous attempts and providing actionable feedback to prevent repetitive mistakes. It is optimized using policy gradients based on the difference in returns between trials.Experiments are conducted using the HotPotQA dataset consisting of multi-step question answering tasks. Results show that Retroformer agents learn faster and achieve higher final success rates compared to baseline methods like Reflexion that do not use gradient-based learning. The key advantage is the ability to do credit assignment and provide structured reflections to promote faster learning. This demonstrates the promise of using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents where model finetuning may not be feasible. The agnostic nature of Retroformer makes it widely applicable to different cloud-hosted LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces Retroformer, a framework for iteratively improving large language agent models by learning a plug-in retrospective model. The key idea is to use a smaller local language model as the retrospective model, which generates verbal feedback to refine the prompts given to the large cloud-based actor language model. A policy gradient approach is taken to optimize the retrospective model parameters based on the difference in episodic returns, using standard RLHF training procedures like PPO. This allows the retrospective model to learn to provide better reflections and action plans from environmental rewards, without needing to access or propagate gradients through the frozen actor model parameters. The retrospective model provides a form of automatic prompt tuning to help the actor model learn from experience over trials.
