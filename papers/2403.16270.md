# [Constricting Normal Latent Space for Anomaly Detection with Normal-only   Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Anomaly detection is challenging due to the rarity of anomalous data. Autoencoders (AEs) are commonly used in a one-class classification setting, where only normal data is available for training. 
- However, AEs can often "generalize" too well and reconstruct anomalous data, reducing their ability to discriminate between normal and anomalous data. This over-generalization happens because there is no mechanism to constrict the latent space, allowing it to grow too large.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel latent constriction loss that limits the reconstruction capability of the AE by restraining the latent space.
- Explore two types of constriction losses using a norm sphere: 
    1) Constrict inside the sphere: Penalize latent features that fall outside a hypersphere of radius α.
    2) Constrict on sphere surface: Penalize any deviation from a hypersphere of radius α.
- The constriction loss is combined with the standard AE reconstruction loss during training. No extra computations needed during inference.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a simple but effective latent constriction loss to limit over-generalization of AEs for anomaly detection.
- Introduce and evaluate two variants of the constriction loss using norm spheres.
- Show improved anomaly detection performance over a baseline AE on three benchmark video datasets (Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech) without any extra computations during inference.
- Achieve performance on par with memory-based methods without needing to store/retrieve memories.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to constrict the latent space of autoencoders that improves their anomaly detection ability using only normal training data. The proposed latent constriction losses are simple, efficient and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
