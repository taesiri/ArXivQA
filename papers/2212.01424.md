# [PROB: Probabilistic Objectness for Open World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01424)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve open world object detection, specifically unknown object detection, by developing a probabilistic framework for estimating objectness? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Learning a probabilistic model of general "objectness" that captures features common across all objects can help improve detection of both known and unknown objects.

2) Alternating between estimating the objectness probability distribution and maximizing the likelihood of known objects during training can allow distinguishing objects from background without needing explicit negative examples. 

3) Using the estimated objectness distribution during inference to compute the likelihood that each object proposal is indeed an object can improve detection of unknown objects.

4) Incorporating active exemplar selection based on objectness scores into incremental learning can further boost open world detection performance.

The main goal seems to be developing a novel probabilistic objectness framework that can be integrated into standard object detectors like deformable DETR to improve their performance on open world detection, especially unknown object detection which has been a major challenge. The method alternates between distribution parameter estimation and likelihood maximization during training, and uses the learned model at inference time to estimate proposal objectness probabilities.
