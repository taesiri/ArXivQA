# [Stoch BiRo: Design and Control of a low cost bipedal robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06512)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Stoch BiRo, a low-cost bipedal robot with point feet designed for navigating uneven and unfamiliar terrains. The robot employs a modular mechanical structure with proprioceptive actuation in the abduction, hips, and knees. To overcome computational constraints, a learning-based linear policy controller manages balance and locomotion using only 3 degrees of freedom per leg, unlike typical 5DOF bipeds. This controller is integrated into a hierarchical control architecture that enables autonomous handling of disturbances without external sensors or terrain knowledge. The policies are trained in simulation using MuJoCo and transferred to the Stoch BiRo hardware for initial validations. Key results demonstrate walking on flat terrain and adapting to slopes and sinusoidal surfaces. This combination of simplified mechanical design, efficient control strategies, and autonomous adaptation promises versatility for real-world applications. The open-source platform also enables further research and benchmarks between bipedal systems. Overall, this work showcases an innovative approach to developing low-cost yet robust bipedal robots.
