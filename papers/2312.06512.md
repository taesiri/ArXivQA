# [Stoch BiRo: Design and Control of a low cost bipedal robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06512)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Stoch BiRo, a low-cost bipedal robot with point feet designed for navigating uneven and unfamiliar terrains. The robot employs a modular mechanical structure with proprioceptive actuation in the abduction, hips, and knees. To overcome computational constraints, a learning-based linear policy controller manages balance and locomotion using only 3 degrees of freedom per leg, unlike typical 5DOF bipeds. This controller is integrated into a hierarchical control architecture that enables autonomous handling of disturbances without external sensors or terrain knowledge. The policies are trained in simulation using MuJoCo and transferred to the Stoch BiRo hardware for initial validations. Key results demonstrate walking on flat terrain and adapting to slopes and sinusoidal surfaces. This combination of simplified mechanical design, efficient control strategies, and autonomous adaptation promises versatility for real-world applications. The open-source platform also enables further research and benchmarks between bipedal systems. Overall, this work showcases an innovative approach to developing low-cost yet robust bipedal robots.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Bipedal robots have potential for navigating environments like humans, but practical realization faces challenges of high costs and limited adaptability to unstructured terrains.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces "Stoch BiRo", a low-cost bipedal robot designed with a modular mechanical structure and point feet to navigate uneven and unfamiliar terrains. 
- It employs proprioceptive actuation in the abduction, hips and knees, using a Raspberry Pi 4 for control. 
- A learning-based linear policy controller manages balance and locomotion with only 3 degrees of freedom per leg, distinct from typical 5DOF bipeds.
- Integrated modular control architecture enables autonomous handling of terrain disturbances without external sensors or environment knowledge.

Main Contributions:

1. Low-complexity, torque-controlled actuator module for impedance/force control using off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts.  

2. Computationally lightweight learning-based walking controller, demonstrating such motions on point-foot bipeds under environmental uncertainty for the first time.

3. Open-source platform with mechanical design files, electronic component details, and control software for reproducibility.  

The robot's adaptability, cost-effectiveness in design, control strategies and autonomous navigation are highlighted, promising diverse real-world robotics applications. Results show proficient walking abilities and robustness without relying on external sensing, underscoring capability for successful locomotion in challenging situations.
