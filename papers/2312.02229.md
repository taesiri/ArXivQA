# [Synthetic Data Generation Techniques for Developing AI-based Speech   Assessments for Parkinson's Disease (A Comparative Study)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02229)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Changes in speech and language can be early signs of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, there is interest in using AI-based speech analysis to identify individuals with PD.
- Such AI systems rely on machine learning classifiers trained on speech data, but more speech samples are needed to improve performance. 

Proposed Solution:  
- Apply deep learning-based data generation techniques (TVAE, CTGAN, CopulaGAN) to synthesize additional speech data and augment the training set.  
- Compare the impact on classification performance of ML algorithms like random forest, gradient boosting when trained on data generated from different techniques.

Key Contributions:
- Showed CopulaGAN can generate higher quality synthetic speech data (quality score of 68.92%) compared to TVAE and CTGAN according to mathematical similarity to real data.
- Classifiers trained on CopulaGAN data achieved highest accuracy of 90.6% (Extra Trees) using only 12 selected features.
- Identified shimmer and pitch-based features as useful for interpretable PD detection.

Main Conclusion:
- Data augmentation via CopulaGAN improved model performance over real-data baseline. Allows development of accurate and explainable ML classifier to distinguish PD speech patterns using key vocal features like shimmer and pitch.

Future Work:
- Collect more actual speech data to train more robust models.  
- Apply techniques like transfer learning and ensemble models.
- Ensure classifiers remain fair across different demographic groups.
