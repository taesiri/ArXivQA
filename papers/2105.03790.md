# [Distribution Matching for Heterogeneous Multi-Task Learning: a   Large-scale Face Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of heterogeneous multi-task learning, where different types of tasks like classification, regression, and detection are learned jointly. A key challenge is how to enable effective knowledge transfer between such heterogeneous tasks. Most prior works assume full annotation overlap between tasks or rely on collecting large multi-task datasets. This paper explores leveraging task relatedness for co-training tasks with limited or no annotation overlap in a weakly supervised manner.

Proposed Solution:
The main ideas are:
1) Explicitly encode task relatedness either from domain knowledge or empirically from dataset annotations. 
2) Propose label co-annotation and distribution matching losses to couple related tasks. The losses enable knowledge transfer by matching output distributions based on the task relatedness.
3) Build a holistic deep network called FaceBehaviorNet with residual blocks that shares representations between tasks. Train it end-to-end with heterogeneity training batches and coupling losses.

The framework is demonstrated on two case studies: facial behavior analysis and face recognition. For the first, relatedness between tasks like emotion recognition, action unit detection and valence-arousal estimation is obtained from a psychological study. For face recognition, it is inferred empirically from dataset annotations.

Main Contributions:
1) Holistic framework to accommodate heterogeneous tasks using expert knowledge or data-driven task relatedness.

2) Weakly supervised learning approach to couple tasks with limited annotation overlap via proposed distribution matching and label co-annotation.

3) FaceBehaviorNet: First network for large-scale facial analysis that predicts emotions, action units and valence-arousal dimensions. State-of-the-art performance across 10 databases.

4) Demonstrated excellent generalization to unseen datasets and ability for zero-shot and few-shot compound emotion recognition.

5) Showed coupling losses can prevent negative transfer in multi-task learning and outperform single task models.

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework for heterogeneous multi-task learning that leverages task relatedness to enable knowledge transfer between tasks. Innovative coupling losses are proposed to match output distributions across related tasks. The ideas are demonstrated through FaceBehaviorNet which sets new state-of-the-art in facial behavior analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a holistic facial behavior analysis framework, FaceBehaviorNet, that jointly learns multiple heterogeneous tasks like emotion recognition, action unit detection, and face identification in a weakly supervised manner by modeling task relatedness and matching predictions' distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a flexible holistic framework that can accommodate heterogeneous tasks with encoding prior knowledge of tasks relatedness. It evaluates two effective strategies for task relatedness: one obtained from domain knowledge and one inferred empirically from dataset annotations.

2. It proposes an effective weakly-supervised learning approach that couples heterogeneous tasks with little or non-overlapping annotations via distribution matching and label co-annotation. It shows the effectiveness of this approach for face analysis in two case studies: affective computing and face recognition. 

3. It presents the first holistic network, to the best of the authors' knowledge, for facial behavior analysis that is capable of simultaneously predicting 7 basic expressions, 17 action units and continuous valence-arousal emotion dimensions in-the-wild. It utilizes publicly available in-the-wild databases for training and evaluation.

4. It conducts an extensive experimental study evaluating the proposed approach on 10 databases and comparing to single-task networks and state-of-the-art methods. It shows superior performance across all tasks and databases, even on unseen databases not used in training, demonstrating the learned representations generalize very well.

5. It explores the learned feature representations for zero-shot and few-shot learning on the task of compound expression recognition, showing strong generalization abilities.

In summary, the main contribution is a new holistic facial behavior analysis framework with heterogeneous tasks, task relatedness encoding, novel weakly-supervised coupling losses, extensive validation and analysis, and demonstrations of generalization.
