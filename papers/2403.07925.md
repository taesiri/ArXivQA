# [Physics-informed generative model for drug-like molecule conformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating valid molecular conformers is important for applications like protein docking and pharmacophore modeling in drug discovery. Existing methods have limitations in accurately reproducing bonded parameters like bond lengths and angles or handling complex ring systems and macrocycles.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a physics-informed, diffusion-based generative model for conformer generation. 

- The model is composed of separate components for reproducing bond lengths, bond angles, proper/improper torsions, chirality and cis/trans configurations. These are inspired by corresponding terms in classical force fields.

- The model parameters are trained on large datasets of drug-like molecules (QMugs, GEOM-drugs) optimized using quantum-mechanical GFN2-xTB calculations. This provides accurate ground truth for bonded terms.

- Sampling is achieved via numerical solution of a probability flow ODE, allowing both deterministic and stochastic generation. Additional terms can guide sampling.

Contributions:
- Achieves higher accuracy in reproducing bonded parameters like bond lengths and angles compared to methods like OMEGA, RDKit+MMFF94 etc.

- Can reliably handle complex molecules with ring systems, chiral centers, macrocycles etc. Demonstrated on drug-like molecules and experimental PDB/CSD datasets.  

- Interpretable model architecture based on classical force fields enables probing of learned solutions.

- Provides both deterministic and stochastic sampling schemes with optional guided sampling to control conformational freedom.

- Establishes suitable training data and benchmarking methodology for evaluating conformer generation.

The model focuses on reproducing bonded terms rather than sampling all degrees of conformational freedom. The limitations are highlighted and mitigation strategies like guided sampling are demonstrated.
