# [In-n-Out: Calibrating Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are becoming widely used for sensitive tasks like financial fraud detection and drug discovery. However, GNNs are often miscalibrated, meaning their confidence estimates do not match the true probabilities.  
- Prior work showed GNNs are usually underconfident for node classification tasks. But for link prediction, GNNs exhibit more complex behavior - they can be overconfident on positive predictions and underconfident on negative ones.
- No prior calibration methods are designed specifically for calibrating GNN link predictions. Existing methods designed for non-relational data may not work well.

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes IN-N-OUT, the first method to calibrate GNNs for link prediction. 
- It is based on two intuitions: (1) Observing an edge that agrees with the GNN prediction should not change the edge embedding much. (2) Observing an edge that contradicts the prediction should change the embedding more substantially.
- IN-N-OUT computes a temperature parameter that scales the logits based on how much the edge embedding changes when adding/removing that edge from the input graph. The scale factor depends on whether the prediction was positive or negative.

Contributions
- Show for the first time that GNN link predictions exhibit complex calibration patterns, unlike node classification predictions which are usually just underconfident.
- Propose IN-N-OUT, the first approach to calibrate GNN link predictions by comparing edge embeddings with and without the predicted edge.
- Experiments on 7 datasets and 5 GNN architectures show IN-N-OUT consistently achieves better calibration than applying existing calibration methods designed for non-relational data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called IN-N-OUT for calibrating graph neural networks to improve their probability estimates for link prediction tasks, showing it outperforms existing calibration techniques designed for non-relational data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Showing for the first time that GNNs are usually miscalibrated for link prediction tasks. While miscalibration also happens for node classification, the calibration curves for link prediction are more complex, exhibiting a mixed behavior: positive predictions being underconfident, and negative ones being overconfident.

2. Proposing IN-N-OUT, the first method for calibration of GNNs in the context of link prediction. 

3. Experimental results on real data showing that IN-N-OUT consistently outperforms existing calibration methods designed for non-relational data. The paper also performs an ablation study to assess the impact of different components of the proposed model.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating the first calibration method specifically designed for graph neural networks on link prediction tasks. The method is shown to outperform previous calibration techniques that work on non-graph data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Graph neural networks (GNNs)
- Link prediction
- Calibration 
- Miscalibration
- Overconfidence
- Underconfidence
- Expected calibration error (ECE)
- Reliability diagrams
- Temperature scaling
- Post-hoc calibration
- Edge embeddings
- Message passing

The paper examines the calibration and potential miscalibration of graph neural networks (GNNs) when applied to link prediction tasks. It introduces a method called IN-N-OUT to post-hoc calibrate GNNs and improve their reliability for predicting edges in graphs. Key concepts include calibration, overconfidence, underconfidence, expected calibration error, and reliability diagrams. The method leverages edge embeddings and perturbations to an input graph to rescale the predictions and temperatures of a trained GNN.

In summary, the key focus is on calibrating the predictive uncertainty and reliability of GNNs for the task of link prediction through a post-training calibration approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the IN-N-OUT method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that IN-N-OUT is the first method proposed specifically for calibrating graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction. What makes calibrating GNNs for link prediction different or more challenging compared to calibrating GNNs for node classification? 

2. IN-N-OUT computes the temperature parameter $T_{uv}$ as a function of the difference/discrepancy between the edge embedding with versus without the edge $(u,v)$ present. Explain the intuition behind using this strategy rather than just scaling the logits directly as in classical temperature scaling.

3. The loss function for training IN-N-OUT has 3 components - NLL loss, ECE loss, and a custom calibration loss. Explain the motivation and effect of each of these loss terms. Why is using just the NLL loss not sufficient?

4. The paper experiments with both the Euclidean distance and raw difference between edge embeddings as the discrepancy measure $\gamma()$ in IN-N-OUT. Compare and contrast the effects of using these two options. When might using one be better than the other?

5. How does the training procedure and computational complexity of IN-N-OUT during inference compare to classical post-hoc calibration methods like temperature scaling and isotonic regression? What are the tradeoffs?

6. The paper demonstrates that GNNs for link prediction exhibit a mixed calibration behavior, with positive predictions being overconfident and negative predictions being underconfident. Why might this occur and why is it different than calibration patterns for node classification tasks?

7. The ablation study compares IN-N-OUT to a baseline that just passes the original edge embeddings through an MLP to predict temperature. Why does IN-N-OUT outperform this simpler baseline? What is the limitation of just using the original embeddings?

8. What challenges need to be overcome to apply IN-N-OUT to very large graphs where recomputing embeddings for perturbed graphs may become prohibitively expensive? Could approximate embedding methods help address this issue?

9. The paper evaluates on a range of real-world datasets and GNN variants but primarily considers binary link prediction. How might the calibration behavior and the IN-N-OUT method need to be adapted for multi-class link prediction?

10. Could the ideas behind IN-N-OUT, namely using differences between edge embeddings to predict calibration parameters, be applicable to other graph learning tasks like node or graph classification? How might the specific approach need to change?
