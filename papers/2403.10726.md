# [Strict Partitioning for Sporadic Rigid Gang Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of scheduling parallel tasks called "gang tasks" on multi-core systems. Gang tasks are composed of one or more threads that must execute simultaneously on a fixed number of processors. Scheduling gang tasks introduces challenges compared to scheduling sequential tasks, including:

- Determining how to assign tasks to processors since gang tasks require allocating groups of processors at once 

- Handling inter-task interference and priority inversions that can be more complex with gang task parallelism

- Achieving high processor utilization when gang tasks have diverse parallelism requirements

The paper focuses on "rigid" gang tasks that have a fixed degree of parallelism that cannot change at runtime.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a scheduling approach called "strict partitioning" to address these challenges. The key ideas are:

1) Partition processors and tasks disjointly into groups to eliminate interference between partitions

2) Assign tasks with similar parallelism to the same partition to reduce interference and enable tighter schedulability tests 

3) Allow flexibility in choosing scheduler algorithms within each partition 

Specifically, the strict partitioning approach has two steps:

Offline Partitioning:
- Divide processors into disjoint partitions 
- Assign each gang task to one partition using a "First Fit Decreasing Volume" heuristic that favors assigning tasks with similar parallelism to the same partition

Online Scheduling:
- Schedule tasks within each partition using either a uniprocessor or global gang scheduler 

Contributions:
The main contributions are:

- Introduction and evaluation of the strict partitioning concept for rigid gang task scheduling

- A First Fit Decreasing Volume heuristic for partitioning processors and tasks

- Two variants called SP-U and SP-G that combine strict partitioning with uniprocessor and global gang scheduling

- Utilization bounds on schedulability under SP-U

- Modifications to improve performance under SP-G

- Extensive experiments showing significant schedulability improvements compared to prior gang scheduling approaches

The results demonstrate the promise of strict partitioning to effectively schedule rigid gang task sets with good processor utilization.
