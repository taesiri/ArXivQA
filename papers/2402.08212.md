# [BBSEA: An Exploration of Brain-Body Synchronization for Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing methods for training embodied agents rely heavily on humans for proposing tasks and customizing scenes. This limits the learning autonomy, efficiency, and generalization capability of the agents. The goal is to develop a framework to enable autonomous acquisition of diverse physical interaction skills for embodied agents with minimal human involvement.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a brain-body synchronization (BBSEA) scheme that combines the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) as the "brain" and the physical capabilities of embodied agents as the "body". 

The key ideas are:
1) The LLM takes in information about the scene and proposes diverse, achievable tasks for the agent to learn. It also defines metrics to determine if a task is successfully completed.

2) The agent performs the proposed tasks via trial-and-error using primitive actions. Successful executions are collected to train a task-conditioned policy network via behavior cloning.

3) By continuously proposing new tasks and learning policies, the agent aligns its physical skills with the LLM's understanding of the tasks, achieving brain-body synchronization.

The system uses robust perception modules to allow the LLM to accurately comprehend object states and relationships. Fixed prompts are designed to elicit compatible task proposals and completion metrics from the LLM.


Main Contributions:

1) A framework for autonomous skill acquisition by synchronizing LLMs and embodied agents without human involvement.

2) Modules for scene-compatible task proposal and completion inference using LLMs to minimize human effort.

3) Experiments showing continuous policy learning and reasonable adaptability of the distilled policy to new tasks, highlighting the potential of scaling up the framework.

The work provides useful insights and foundation for future research towards utilizing LFMs for automated training of intelligent embodied agents in more complex real-world environments.
