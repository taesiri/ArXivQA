# [PromptBench: A Unified Library for Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07910)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces PromptBench, a new open-source Python library for evaluating large language models (LLMs). PromptBench provides unified components to build pipelines for assessing LLM capabilities across diverse tasks and models. Key framework features include loading benchmarks and models, crafting customizable prompts (with integrated prompt engineering techniques), executing adversarial attacks on prompts, applying dynamic evaluation protocols, and leveraging analysis tools. PromptBench aims to boost LLM understanding, facilitate novel research, and mitigate risks. It currently supports various models (e.g. GPT-3, PaLM, ChatGPT), tasks (translation, reasoning), attacks (semantic, checklist), protocols (dynamic evaluation), and interpretability methods. Being modular and extensible by design, PromptBench intends as an evolving library dedicated specifically to streamlined yet multifaceted LLM assessment, benefiting the broader community.
