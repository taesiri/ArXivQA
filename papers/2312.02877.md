## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel dynamic point cloud registration network to improve efficiency. It employs an iterative approach to discover overlapping regions and narrow down the scope through multiple registrations. Specifically, it first performs sparse global sampling for coarse registration. Then a refined node proposal module utilizes DBSCAN clustering on the paired points to find inlier concentration regions for subsequent local registration. This local registration further optimizes the alignment. A classifier acts as an early exiting mechanism after each registration stage to evaluate results and determine if further iteration is necessary. Compared to prior works, this method significantly reduces computational cost and time while maintaining accuracy. Experiments demonstrate over 40\% faster runtime on indoor datasets and 33% on outdoor datasets versus state-of-the-art methods with comparable or higher registration recall. The iterative localized registration effectively eliminates outliers and enables adaptive inference by avoiding unnecessary computation when sufficient accuracy is achieved. This introduces dynamic networks to point cloud registration for the first time and provides an efficient approach.
