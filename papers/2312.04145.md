# [Diffusing Colors: Image Colorization with Text Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Diffusing Colors: Image Colorization with Text Guided Diffusion":

Problem:
- Image colorization is challenging as it is an ill-posed problem with infinite potential colorizations for a grayscale image. This leads to colorization models producing desaturated outputs or introducing artifacts.
- Fully automatic methods like GANs suffer from instability and mode collapse. User guided methods require tedious input. 
- Lack of large-scale datasets with ground-truth colors makes training difficult, especially for historical images.

Proposed Solution:
- Uses latent diffusion model for efficient colorization training and inference. Analyzes latent space of pretrained VAE and shows color scaling is linear.  
- Employs text prompts for guidance without strict coupling between colors and objects. This provides control while allowing fully automated colorization.
- Samples colors iteratively like in Cold Diffusion, predicting color residual vectors. Replaces luma channel after decoding to reduce artifacts.
- Introduces CLIP-based color ranker to automatically select optimal colorfulness based on image semantics.

Main Contributions:
- State-of-the-art colorization method using diffusion models and text prompts for guidance.
- Analysis of VAE latent space showing linear color scaling.
- Control over output colors and styles using text without strict color-object coupling.
- Fully automated setup also supported through negative prompts and color ranker.  
- Applications in color enhancement and restoration demonstrated through experiments.
- Extensive comparison to previous methods with quantitative metrics and user study.
