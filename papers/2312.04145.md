# [Diffusing Colors: Image Colorization with Text Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04145)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a new method for image colorization based on diffusion models and text guidance. The key idea is to leverage the expressiveness and control of diffusion models, while operating in an efficient latent space from a VAE. They analyze the latent space and find color vectors behave linearly, allowing color manipulation. They adapt the Cold Diffusion framework for colorization by defining the degradation as converting RGB to grayscale in latent space. Their model is trained to predict a color residual vector given the degraded latent code. At inference, they iteratively predict color residuals to reconstruct the image color. Their method allows fine-grained control via text prompts that guide the colorization. They also present a CLIP-based color ranker to automatically select the most suitable colorfulness level. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of quality and control. The iterative sampling produces more vibrant colors than previous methods. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with a user study, validate the advantages of their approach. Key applications include color enhancement for legacy images. Limitations relate to spatial layout control in prompts. Overall, their text-guided colorization method advances the state-of-the-art by leveraging diffusion models in an efficient latent space in a controllable way.
