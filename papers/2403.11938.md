## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on convolutional layers within convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used in image processing. Convolutional layers are linear time-invariant 2D or ND dynamical systems and can be represented by their impulse response, which is the convolution kernel. However, for analysis tools from control theory, e.g. involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), typically state space representations of dynamical systems are useful. So there is a need to provide a state space representation of convolutional layers.

Main Results:

1) The paper presents a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2D convolutional layers with $c_{in}r_1 + c_{out}r_2$ states, where $c_{in}/c_{out}$ is the number of input/output channels and $r_1/r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. They prove the representation is minimal for the case $c_{in} = c_{out}$.

2) They show how to generalize this approach to other types of convolutions, including 1D, multi-dimensional, strided and dilated convolutions, providing explicit state space realization formulas, supported by examples.

3) They contribute by introducing a reshaping operation called $\operatorname{reshape}_\mathbf{s}$ which transforms the input signal to enable a state space representation of strided convolutions. 

4) For 2D convolutions with $c_{in}=c_{out}$, they prove the state space realization they provide is minimal among all realizations, given a full column rank condition on the convolution kernel.

The state space representations provided enable future work on LMI-based analysis and synthesis of convolutional neural networks by replacing convolutional layers with their compact dynamical systems representations. The paper contributes by making CNNs more amenable to safety verification tools from control theory.
