# [HybridAugment++: Unified Frequency Spectra Perturbations for Model   Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to improve the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to various distribution shifts by taking a frequency-centric perspective during training. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that CNNs tend to rely too much on high-frequency image content, which can make them vulnerable to common corruptions and adversarial attacks. To address this, they propose two data augmentation techniques called HybridAugment and HybridAugment++ that aim to reduce the models' reliance on high frequencies and promote the use of phase information instead.The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:- Swapping high and low frequency content between images during training can reduce models' reliance on high frequencies and improve corruption robustness. This is the idea behind HybridAugment.- Additionally perturbing phase/amplitude in the low frequencies and combining with high frequency content can further improve robustness by promoting phase over amplitude information. This is HybridAugment++. - These types of hierarchical frequency augmentations can improve robustness to corruptions, adversarial attacks, and out-of-distribution detection without sacrificing (and sometimes improving) clean accuracy.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that these frequency-based data augmentations can bridge the gap between human and machine perception by regularizing CNNs to focus less on high frequencies and more on phase information, thus improving their generalization under distribution shifts. The paper presents experiments across various datasets and metrics to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing two new data augmentation methods called HybridAugment and HybridAugment++ that aim to reduce the reliance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on high-frequency image information and promote the use of phase information. 2. Showing that HybridAugment improves corruption robustness of CNNs while preserving or improving clean accuracy. It also provides some adversarial robustness.3. Showing that HybridAugment++ further improves adversarial and corruption robustness compared to HybridAugment, while further improving clean accuracy against several alternatives. 4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive results using HybridAugment++ on benchmark datasets for clean accuracy, corruption robustness, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution detection.5. Proposing a simple framework to unify different frequency-based data augmentations into a single training pipeline.In summary, the main contributions appear to be proposing two new data augmentation techniques that improve model robustness across different distribution shifts, while preserving or improving accuracy. The methods are simple, require no extra data or models, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks and datasets.
