# [Value Gradient weighted Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01464)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve model-based reinforcement learning by making the model learning process more aware of the impact of model errors on the value function? Specifically, the paper proposes a new loss function called VaGraM (Value Gradient weighted Model loss) that aims to learn a dynamics model that is accurate in the dimensions and regions of the state space that matter most for the value function and policy optimization. This is in contrast to typical maximum likelihood model learning objectives that do not account for the downstream use of the model.The key hypotheses seem to be:- Standard maximum likelihood model learning objectives lead to a mismatch between model accuracy and value function accuracy that hurts policy optimization in model-based RL.- Making the model learning objective "value aware" by weighting the loss based on value function gradients can improve model-based RL performance, especially in settings with limited model capacity or irrelevant state dimensions.- Prior theoretical value-aware model learning objectives like VAML do not work well empirically because they can optimize meaningless value predictions outside the state distribution and get stuck in bad local minima. - The proposed VaGraM loss avoids these optimization issues and leads to improved model-based RL results on challenging MuJoCo tasks compared to maximum likelihood modeling.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that value-aware model learning can improve model-based RL, and VaGraM is proposed as a practical way to achieve this that fixes limitations of prior value-aware modeling attempts. The experiments aim to test if VaGraM delivers on its promises in practice.
