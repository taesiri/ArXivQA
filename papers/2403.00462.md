# [LUCID: LLM-Generated Utterances for Complex and Interesting Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00462)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing dialog datasets have limited domain coverage and lack linguistically complex phenomena, making it difficult to properly evaluate dialog models. 
- Current machine-to-machine data collection still relies heavily on human involvement, limiting scale and ability to quickly generate data for new domains.

Proposed Solution:
- LUCID - an automated pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high quality, diverse and challenging dialog data across multiple domains and intents.
- Breaks down data generation into 14 simpler LLM stages to ensure accuracy. Uses multiple LLM validators to discard low quality data.  
- Conversation planner guides user LLM agent to cover wide range of 'happy path' and challenging 'unhappy path' phenomena. Phenomena explicitly labeled at turn level.

Contributions:
1) Highly automated methodology to produce quality LLM-generated conversations at scale.
2) Release challenging multi-domain, multi-intent dataset with 4277 dialogs across 100 intents. Includes more labeled phenomena than prior datasets.
3) Provide in-domain and out-of-domain test sets to evaluate generalization.
4) Release data generation code to create more data across intents/domains and additional phenomena.

In summary, the paper introduces an automated LLM-based pipeline called LUCID that can rapidly generate high quality, diverse and challenging dialog data at scale across multiple domains. Both the dataset and data generation code are released to advance dialog research.
