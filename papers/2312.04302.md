# [Prompt Highlighter: Interactive Control for Multi-Modal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04302)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Prompt Highlighter, a novel method for enabling fine-grained user control over text generation in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The key idea is to allow users to highlight specific parts of the input text or image to guide the model's focus during generation. This is achieved by constructing regular and unconditional input embeddings based on the highlighted tokens, and using classifier-free guidance to steer the model toward the highlighted content. Furthermore, an attention activation strategy is proposed to reweight the attention scores corresponding to highlighted tokens, so the model attends more strongly to those parts. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that Prompt Highlighter significantly enhances controllability over generation, improves relevance to highlighted contexts, and mitigates hallucination. Without any training, it boosts the performance of LLaVA-v1.5 to place 2nd on the MMBench and MME leaderboards. The method is model-agnostic and works for both text-only and multimodal inputs. Overall, Prompt Highlighter enables more transparent and customizable generation through intuitive human-model interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Prompt Highlighter, a novel method that enables users to interactively control the focus of text generation in language models during inference by highlighting specific parts of the input context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel inference approach called "Prompt Highlighter" that enables token-level user interactions for personalized and controllable text generation with multi-modal large language models (LLMs & VLMs). 

Specifically, it allows users to highlight specific parts of the input context, including both text and images, to guide the model's focus during text generation. This is achieved by constructing regular and unconditional context pairs and employing classifier-free guidance to adjust the predicted token probabilities.

The paper also introduces an attention activation strategy that further reweights the attention scores associated with the highlighted tokens, enabling better focus on user-selected contexts.

Experiments demonstrate that without any additional training, Prompt Highlighter can significantly enhance multi-modal LLMs' overall performance and generation quality across diverse tasks. It also provides intuitive control over the output to produce customized and reliable results aligned with user needs.

In summary, the main contribution is pioneering the exploration of fine-grained human-model interactions for controllable text generation in multi-modal LLMs using a simple yet effective highlighting mechanism.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have great capabilities for text generation based on contextual inputs. However, their autoregressive nature makes the generation process hard to control and heavily reliant on prompt design.
- Existing methods like prompt engineering require careful crafting of prompts and still fail to offer fine-grained control over generation. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Prompt Highlighter", a novel method to enable token-level control over LLM/VLM generation via user highlighting of input contexts.

- It allows users to highlight words/phrases in text or regions in images to guide model attention. 

- The highlighting construct a regular vs unconditional context pair to steer output generation towards highlighted parts using classifier-free guidance.

- An attention activation mechanism is also introduced to further reweight attention scores of highlighted tokens.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneers fine-grained human-model interactions for controllable generation in LLMs/VLMs using input highlighting.

- Achieves reliable and customizable generation without any model re-training.

- Significantly enhances caption quality and overall performance on standardized benchmarks.

- Provides intuitive control beyond prompt engineering and establishes a promising direction for enhancing user interactions with multi-modal LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective plug-and-play method for token-level user guidance over text generation in LLMs/VLMs via input highlighting. This facilitates reliable and customizable output without additional training.
