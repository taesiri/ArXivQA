## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Prompt Highlighter, a novel method for enabling fine-grained user control over text generation in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The key idea is to allow users to highlight specific parts of the input text or image to guide the model's focus during generation. This is achieved by constructing regular and unconditional input embeddings based on the highlighted tokens, and using classifier-free guidance to steer the model toward the highlighted content. Furthermore, an attention activation strategy is proposed to reweight the attention scores corresponding to highlighted tokens, so the model attends more strongly to those parts. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that Prompt Highlighter significantly enhances controllability over generation, improves relevance to highlighted contexts, and mitigates hallucination. Without any training, it boosts the performance of LLaVA-v1.5 to place 2nd on the MMBench and MME leaderboards. The method is model-agnostic and works for both text-only and multimodal inputs. Overall, Prompt Highlighter enables more transparent and customizable generation through intuitive human-model interactions.
