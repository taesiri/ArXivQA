# [Brainformers: Trading Simplicity for Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00008)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we design more efficient and higher quality transformer-based language models by optimizing the model architecture and layer composition?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Trading off regularity and uniformity in the model architecture can lead to better training efficiency and model quality.2) Introducing heterogeneity in the network topology and layer types, including sparse layers, can improve computational efficiency. 3) Optimizing the gating mechanisms and routing strategies together with the network architecture is important for scaling sparse models effectively.4) Searching over a more flexible architecture space with various layer types and sparsity, guided by training time and inference time constraints, can discover models with much faster training convergence, faster inference, and better quality.The authors propose a block-wise architecture search approach called Brainformer that allows mixing different layer types like attention, dense feed-forward, and sparsely gated feed-forward layers. By searching over possible block architectures, routing mechanisms, and other hyperparameters, the goal is to find models that scale much better in training efficiency and model quality compared to standard or sparsely gated transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a new neural network architecture called Brainformer that aims to improve efficiency and scaling compared to standard Transformer architectures. Brainformer uses more complex blocks with heterogeneous layer types rather than the uniform blocks in Transformers.- Introducing a block-wise architecture search method to automatically discover efficient Brainformer blocks. The search algorithm optimizes various architectural attributes like layer types, layer dimensions, routing mechanisms, etc. to minimize pre-training perplexity within a fixed training budget.- Demonstrating that Brainformer found by this architecture search approach achieves significantly better training efficiency in terms of convergence speed, step time, and perplexity compared to Transformer baselines. For example, at 8B scale Brainformer is 5x faster per step and converges 2x faster.- Showing that Brainformer also generalizes better, with 3% higher average score on SuperGLUE tasks and strong improvements on generative QA tasks compared to baselines.- Proposing a compute-efficient scaling approach that accounts for both model capacity and training budget when evaluating model architectures. This enables fairer comparisons across model families than just fixing model size or training tokens.In summary, the key contribution is presenting Brainformer as a more efficient architecture that outperforms Transformers, enabled by an architecture search method designed for efficiency. The results demonstrate improved training convergence, throughput, and generalization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper proposes a new neural network architecture called Brainformer that aims to improve the efficiency and scalability of Transformer models. It builds on prior work on sparse models like GLaM and MoE, but takes a more flexible block-based approach to model architecture.- Compared to models like GLaM that interleave dense and sparse layers in a fixed pattern, Brainformer allows more complex blocks with diverse layer types like attention, dense feedforward layers, sparsely gated layers, etc. This provides more architectural flexibility.- The paper introduces a neural architecture search approach to find optimal Brainformer blocks, instead of manually designing the architecture. This allows customization for efficiency and quality.- Brainformer incorporates different gating mechanisms like expert choice routing, instead of just top-k gating used in models like GShard and GLaM. This expands the search space.- For evaluation, the paper emphasizes using fixed training time and computational cost constraints, rather than just comparing model capacity. This allows fairer comparisons between dense and sparse models.- Experiments show Brainformer converges much faster in training and achieves better quality-efficiency tradeoffs compared to models like GLaM and Primer. It also generalizes better on downstream tasks.- Overall, Brainformer pushes the state-of-the-art in efficient transformer design by using automated architecture search, flexible heterogeneous blocks, and expert-based routing. The results demonstrate the value of these techniques for scaling up transformers.In summary, Brainformer differentiates itself by its more flexible block-based design, incorporation of neural architecture search, use of diverse expert routing schemes, and rigorous efficiency-focused evaluation approach. These contributions aim to unlock further quality and efficiency gains in large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Exploring different model architectures beyond transformers. The paper focuses on optimizing transformer blocks, but notes that other architectures like MLP-Mixers or sparse attention could also benefit from similar architecture search and heterogeneity. They suggest applying the techniques to other model families. - Searching over additional axes like model width, depth, kernel sizes, etc. The current search focuses on layer order, sparsity, and routing. Expanding the search space along other architectural dimensions like width and depth could lead to further gains.- Applying the techniques to computer vision tasks. The empirical validation focuses on NLP, but the authors note the techniques could also be relevant for vision.- Simplifying the discovered architectures. The paper notes the optimized blocks are complex, and it could be interesting to study if the blocks can be simplified without losing performance. For example, finding repetitive patterns or testing performance with simpler layer orderings.- Reducing search computation costs. The full search used a lot of computational resources, so finding ways to make the search more efficient could enable broader applications.In summary, the main future directions are expanding the architectural search space, applying it to new domains like vision, simplifying the discovered architectures, and reducing the search costs. The core idea of optimizing block architectures and heterogeneity shows promise across model families and tasks.
