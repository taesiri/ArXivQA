# [Larimar: Large Language Models with Episodic Memory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Efficiently updating the knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) with new facts is critical but challenging. Methods like finetuning risk catastrophic forgetting. External memory models enable updating but have issues with generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Larimar, a novel LLM architecture augmented with an episodic memory module. The memory allows dynamic one-shot knowledge updates without expensive retraining.

- The memory uses a generative model and Bayesian inference for fast writing. Updated memory conditions LLM decoder for edited output.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates Larimar's accuracy on fact editing tasks, achieving comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Editing is 4-10x faster than competitive baselines.

- Shows Larimar's ability for selective fact forgetting by reversing the one-shot memory update. Also enables information leakage prevention by writing censored responses. 

- Provides a recursive memory search method that allows Larimar to generalize to longer input contexts beyond its training.

- Overall, Larimar enables real-time knowledge adaptation for LLMs through its trainable episodic memory. The architecture is simple, general, and LLM-agnostic.
