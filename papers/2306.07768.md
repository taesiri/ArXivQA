# [Area is all you need: repeatable elements make stronger adversarial   attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07768)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How does the size/area of adversarial patches impact their effectiveness at evading detection by object detection models? The paper investigates this question through several experiments that systematically vary the size of adversarial patches and evaluate their attack success rate against YOLOv2/v3 and Faster R-CNN models. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Increasing the size/area of adversarial patches leads to higher attack success rates against object detectors. 2) Adversarial patches optimized on one object detection model may not transfer well to other model architectures.3) Prior reported attack success rates may be reduced or fail to replicate if adversarial patches are downsized when implemented physically (e.g. printed on shirts).The experiments aim to elucidate the relationship between patch size and evasion efficacy, while also probing issues around transferability across models and reproducibility of prior attack results. The central thesis seems to be that total patch area is the primary driver of attack success.
