# [GETMusic: Generating Any Music Tracks with a Unified Representation and   Diffusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: 

How can we develop a unified model that is capable of flexibly generating any desired target instrumental tracks in symbolic music, either from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary user-provided source tracks?

The key issues this paper tries to address are:

- Prior sequence-based and image-based approaches for symbolic music generation have limitations in generating diverse target tracks due to constraints in the music representations and model architectures used.

- There is a need for a unified model that can handle the diverse and flexible combination of source and target tracks in music composition.

To address these issues, the paper proposes GETMusic, which consists of two main components:

- A new multi-track music representation called GETScore that efficiently represents notes as tokens in a 2D structure with tracks stacked vertically.

- A conditional discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that can flexibly generate any user-specified target tracks by masking and then denoising the target tracks based on provided source tracks during training.

The central hypothesis is that the co-designed representation and diffusion model will enable flexible control over generating any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary source tracks to meet diverse music composition needs with a single unified model.

In summary, the key research question is how to develop a unified symbolic music generation model capable of producing any target instrumental tracks flexibly based on arbitrary source tracks, which GETMusic aims to address through its novel representation and architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GETMusic, a unified representation and diffusion framework for generating any desired music tracks. The key components of GETMusic are:

- A new music representation called GETScore that represents musical notes as tokens arranged in a 2D structure with tracks stacked vertically and progressing horizontally. This allows flexible specification of source and target tracks for generation. 

- A discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that can generate the desired target tracks by conditioning on provided source tracks. It randomly masks the target tracks and learns to predict the masked tokens based on the source tracks.

- With the proposed representation and diffusion model, GETMusic can generate any arbitrary combination of target tracks from scratch or conditioned on source tracks in a controllable manner. This addresses the diverse needs for music generation. 

- Experiments show GETMusic achieves high-quality music generation and outperforms previous methods designed for specific track combinations. The unified framework consistently exhibits strong performance across a wide range of source-target combinations.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel representation and diffusion model to enable a unified and controllable framework for generating diverse combinations of music tracks to meet flexible composition needs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes GETMusic, a new framework for generating musical tracks, which uses a compact 2D token representation called GETScore and a conditional discrete diffusion model called GETDiff to flexibly generate any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on source tracks in a non-autoregressive manner.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on symbolic music generation:

- This paper introduces a new representation called GETScore for representing multi-track polyphonic music as well as a diffusion model called GETDiff for generating music conditioned on this representation. Other papers have used sequence-based or image-based representations, but this 2D token-based representation is novel.

- The ability to flexibly generate any desired target tracks conditioned on any user-provided source tracks is a key contribution. Most prior works focus on specific source-target combinations like piano accompaniment from melody. This framework supports many more combinations.

- The paper demonstrates strong results on common tasks like 5-track accompaniment generation and 6-track unconditional generation, outperforming recent models like PopMAG and Museformer. This shows it is competitive or superior to prior work on well-studied tasks.

- More importantly, it consistently generates high-quality results across a diverse range of 665 different source-target combinations, while most prior work focuses on only 1 task. The versatility across tasks is a major strength.

- The non-autoregressive generation and explicit control over target tracks is an advantage over sequence-based methods. Image-based piano roll methods also cannot handle as many combinations due to sparsity limitations.

- The compact representation and diffusion framework may offer computational benefits over methods based on large transformer architectures and autoregressive decoding.

Overall, the combination of the representation, diffusion framework, and results across diverse generation tasks make this a very strong paper compared to prior work. The innovations in representation and modeling open up new capabilities in conditional symbolic music generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporating lyrics as an additional track in the representation to enable lyric-to-melody generation capabilities. The authors mention that this is an interesting direction to explore to enhance the versatility of their framework.

- Exploring the potential of their framework for other creative applications, such as generating transitions or bridges between different music pieces by concatenating and masking parts of the scores. The authors provided some initial demonstrations but suggest further exploration. 

- Extending the framework to generate longer musical scores by training on longer sequences and experimenting with different positional encodings. The paper evaluated on scores up to 32 bars, so scaling up is an area for future work.

- Enhancing the modeling of musical structure and harmony, for example by incorporating confidence sampling during inference. The authors prototyped this idea but leave full exploration as future work.

- Evaluating the framework on other music genres beyond pop music, which was the focus in this paper. Generalizing to other genres could demonstrate wider applicability.

- Augmenting the framework with extra musical knowledge, for instance music theory principles, to further improve the coherence and harmonicity. 

- Conducting more comprehensive human evaluations on the perceptual quality of generated results across diverse tasks.

In summary, the key future directions are extending the capabilities of the framework, enhancing the musicality of results, evaluating on more genres and lengths, and performing more robust human assessments. The authors have laid a strong foundation and suggest several interesting ways to build on their work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes GETMusic, a unified representation and diffusion framework for symbolic music generation. GETMusic consists of GETScore, a compact multi-track token representation, and GETDiff, a discrete diffusion model. During training, GETDiff randomly selects some tracks as sources and others as targets. The targets are corrupted via masking tokens while sources remain unchanged. GETDiff then predicts the masked tokens in a non-autoregressive manner based on the provided sources. With the separate track representation in GETScore and the controllable generation behavior of GETDiff, GETMusic can generate any desired target tracks conditioned on arbitrary user-provided source tracks. Experiments on generating 665 combinations of 6 instruments demonstrate GETMusic's effectiveness in high-quality generation for diverse needs compared to prior works. The framework's strengths are the flexible source-target specification, explicit generation control, and enabling zero-shot infilling.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes GETMusic, a unified representation and diffusion framework for generating any desired music tracks from scratch or conditioning on user-provided source tracks. The key components of GETMusic are a novel music representation called GETScore and a discrete diffusion model called GETDiff. GETScore represents music notes as tokens arranged in a 2D structure, with tracks stacked vertically and progressing horizontally over time. GETDiff employs a forward corruption process that masks target track tokens and a reverse denoising process that predicts the masked tokens based on the provided source tracks. During training, tracks are randomly selected as targets or sources to cover diverse combinations. 

With the separate track design in GETScore and non-autoregressive prediction of GETDiff, GETMusic allows flexible specification of source and target tracks while explicitly controlling the generation. Experiments demonstrate GETMusic's ability to generate high-quality music conditioning on 665 combinations of 6 instruments, outperforming prior works designed for specific combinations. GETMusic also enables versatile zero-shot infilling by denoising arbitrary masked locations. The unified representation and diffusion framework provides an effective solution for generating any desired music tracks based on various conditions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes GETMusic, a unified framework for generating any desired music tracks from scratch or based on user-provided source tracks. The key components are:

1) A compact multi-track music representation called GETScore that stacks tracks vertically with time progression horizontally. Musical notes are represented using pitch and duration tokens aligned at the corresponding track and onset position. 

2) A discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that corrupts target tracks and learns to denoise them conditioned on source tracks. During training, tracks are randomly selected as targets or sources to cover diverse combinations. At inference, users can flexibly specify the source and target tracks. The model generates all target tokens simultaneously in a non-autoregressive manner.

The co-designed representation and diffusion model allow flexible source/target specification, explicit control over target track generation, and enable zero-shot infilling of arbitrary locations. Experiments on generating 665 track combinations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to develop a unified model for flexible symbolic music generation that can generate any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary source tracks. 

The paper points out limitations in prior sequence-based and image-based approaches for symbolic music generation:

- Sequence-based methods interleave notes from different tracks into a single sequence. This makes it hard to control generation of specific target tracks due to the autoregressive nature of the models. 

- Image-based methods using piano rolls struggle to generate the sparse, high-resolution images needed to represent multiple instrumental tracks. Most prior image-based work focuses on single track unconditional or conditional generation.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes a unified framework called GETMusic with two main components:

1) GETScore, a new 2D symbolic music representation that stacks instrument tracks vertically with time progressing horizontally. Musical notes are represented compactly using pitch and duration tokens. 

2) GETDiff, a discrete diffusion model that can be trained to denoise and generate any desired target tracks conditioned on arbitrary source tracks in a non-autoregressive manner.

By combining the flexible representation of GETScore with the controllable generation of GETDiff, GETMusic aims to offer a unified solution for generating any target instrumental tracks from scratch or based on any source tracks specified by the user.

In summary, the key problem is developing a symbolic music generation model that provides both flexibility in source/target track specification and control over generating the desired targets, which prior sequence and image-based models struggle with. GETMusic proposes a new representation and diffusion-based generation approach to address this problem.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GETMusic, a unified representation and diffusion framework for generating desired target music tracks either from scratch or conditioned on user-provided source tracks. The framework consists of GETScore, a compact 2D token representation that vertically stacks instrument tracks and horizontally aligns them over time, and GETDiff, a discrete diffusion model that operates on GETScore.
