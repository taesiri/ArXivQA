# [GETMusic: Generating Any Music Tracks with a Unified Representation and   Diffusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: How can we develop a unified model that is capable of flexibly generating any desired target instrumental tracks in symbolic music, either from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary user-provided source tracks?The key issues this paper tries to address are:- Prior sequence-based and image-based approaches for symbolic music generation have limitations in generating diverse target tracks due to constraints in the music representations and model architectures used.- There is a need for a unified model that can handle the diverse and flexible combination of source and target tracks in music composition.To address these issues, the paper proposes GETMusic, which consists of two main components:- A new multi-track music representation called GETScore that efficiently represents notes as tokens in a 2D structure with tracks stacked vertically.- A conditional discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that can flexibly generate any user-specified target tracks by masking and then denoising the target tracks based on provided source tracks during training.The central hypothesis is that the co-designed representation and diffusion model will enable flexible control over generating any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary source tracks to meet diverse music composition needs with a single unified model.In summary, the key research question is how to develop a unified symbolic music generation model capable of producing any target instrumental tracks flexibly based on arbitrary source tracks, which GETMusic aims to address through its novel representation and architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing GETMusic, a unified representation and diffusion framework for generating any desired music tracks. The key components of GETMusic are:- A new music representation called GETScore that represents musical notes as tokens arranged in a 2D structure with tracks stacked vertically and progressing horizontally. This allows flexible specification of source and target tracks for generation. - A discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that can generate the desired target tracks by conditioning on provided source tracks. It randomly masks the target tracks and learns to predict the masked tokens based on the source tracks.- With the proposed representation and diffusion model, GETMusic can generate any arbitrary combination of target tracks from scratch or conditioned on source tracks in a controllable manner. This addresses the diverse needs for music generation. - Experiments show GETMusic achieves high-quality music generation and outperforms previous methods designed for specific track combinations. The unified framework consistently exhibits strong performance across a wide range of source-target combinations.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel representation and diffusion model to enable a unified and controllable framework for generating diverse combinations of music tracks to meet flexible composition needs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes GETMusic, a new framework for generating musical tracks, which uses a compact 2D token representation called GETScore and a conditional discrete diffusion model called GETDiff to flexibly generate any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on source tracks in a non-autoregressive manner.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on symbolic music generation:- This paper introduces a new representation called GETScore for representing multi-track polyphonic music as well as a diffusion model called GETDiff for generating music conditioned on this representation. Other papers have used sequence-based or image-based representations, but this 2D token-based representation is novel.- The ability to flexibly generate any desired target tracks conditioned on any user-provided source tracks is a key contribution. Most prior works focus on specific source-target combinations like piano accompaniment from melody. This framework supports many more combinations.- The paper demonstrates strong results on common tasks like 5-track accompaniment generation and 6-track unconditional generation, outperforming recent models like PopMAG and Museformer. This shows it is competitive or superior to prior work on well-studied tasks.- More importantly, it consistently generates high-quality results across a diverse range of 665 different source-target combinations, while most prior work focuses on only 1 task. The versatility across tasks is a major strength.- The non-autoregressive generation and explicit control over target tracks is an advantage over sequence-based methods. Image-based piano roll methods also cannot handle as many combinations due to sparsity limitations.- The compact representation and diffusion framework may offer computational benefits over methods based on large transformer architectures and autoregressive decoding.Overall, the combination of the representation, diffusion framework, and results across diverse generation tasks make this a very strong paper compared to prior work. The innovations in representation and modeling open up new capabilities in conditional symbolic music generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Incorporating lyrics as an additional track in the representation to enable lyric-to-melody generation capabilities. The authors mention that this is an interesting direction to explore to enhance the versatility of their framework.- Exploring the potential of their framework for other creative applications, such as generating transitions or bridges between different music pieces by concatenating and masking parts of the scores. The authors provided some initial demonstrations but suggest further exploration. - Extending the framework to generate longer musical scores by training on longer sequences and experimenting with different positional encodings. The paper evaluated on scores up to 32 bars, so scaling up is an area for future work.- Enhancing the modeling of musical structure and harmony, for example by incorporating confidence sampling during inference. The authors prototyped this idea but leave full exploration as future work.- Evaluating the framework on other music genres beyond pop music, which was the focus in this paper. Generalizing to other genres could demonstrate wider applicability.- Augmenting the framework with extra musical knowledge, for instance music theory principles, to further improve the coherence and harmonicity. - Conducting more comprehensive human evaluations on the perceptual quality of generated results across diverse tasks.In summary, the key future directions are extending the capabilities of the framework, enhancing the musicality of results, evaluating on more genres and lengths, and performing more robust human assessments. The authors have laid a strong foundation and suggest several interesting ways to build on their work.
