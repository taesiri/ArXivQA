# [GETMusic: Generating Any Music Tracks with a Unified Representation and   Diffusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: How can we develop a unified model that is capable of flexibly generating any desired target instrumental tracks in symbolic music, either from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary user-provided source tracks?The key issues this paper tries to address are:- Prior sequence-based and image-based approaches for symbolic music generation have limitations in generating diverse target tracks due to constraints in the music representations and model architectures used.- There is a need for a unified model that can handle the diverse and flexible combination of source and target tracks in music composition.To address these issues, the paper proposes GETMusic, which consists of two main components:- A new multi-track music representation called GETScore that efficiently represents notes as tokens in a 2D structure with tracks stacked vertically.- A conditional discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that can flexibly generate any user-specified target tracks by masking and then denoising the target tracks based on provided source tracks during training.The central hypothesis is that the co-designed representation and diffusion model will enable flexible control over generating any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on arbitrary source tracks to meet diverse music composition needs with a single unified model.In summary, the key research question is how to develop a unified symbolic music generation model capable of producing any target instrumental tracks flexibly based on arbitrary source tracks, which GETMusic aims to address through its novel representation and architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing GETMusic, a unified representation and diffusion framework for generating any desired music tracks. The key components of GETMusic are:- A new music representation called GETScore that represents musical notes as tokens arranged in a 2D structure with tracks stacked vertically and progressing horizontally. This allows flexible specification of source and target tracks for generation. - A discrete diffusion model called GETDiff that can generate the desired target tracks by conditioning on provided source tracks. It randomly masks the target tracks and learns to predict the masked tokens based on the source tracks.- With the proposed representation and diffusion model, GETMusic can generate any arbitrary combination of target tracks from scratch or conditioned on source tracks in a controllable manner. This addresses the diverse needs for music generation. - Experiments show GETMusic achieves high-quality music generation and outperforms previous methods designed for specific track combinations. The unified framework consistently exhibits strong performance across a wide range of source-target combinations.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel representation and diffusion model to enable a unified and controllable framework for generating diverse combinations of music tracks to meet flexible composition needs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes GETMusic, a new framework for generating musical tracks, which uses a compact 2D token representation called GETScore and a conditional discrete diffusion model called GETDiff to flexibly generate any desired target tracks from scratch or conditioned on source tracks in a non-autoregressive manner.
