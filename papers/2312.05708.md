# [Context Tuning for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) have remarkable ability to solve new tasks with few examples. However, they need access to the right tools and information to accomplish tasks effectively. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tries to provide relevant tools to LLMs by retrieving them based on the query. But RAG's tool retrieval relies on all necessary information being present in the query, which often fails for incomplete or lacking context queries.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Context Tuning for RAG, which uses a context retrieval system to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan generation (planning using LLMs). The context retrieval model uses numerical, categorical and usage signals to retrieve and rank relevant context items.

Main Contributions:
1) Show inadequacy of RAG for implicit/context-seeking queries; propose context tuning as solution
2) Compare various context retrieval methods on lightweight models and LLMs
3) Find that Chain of Thought (CoT) augmentation benefits context retrieval without fine-tuning, while fine-tuning removes need for it
4) Propose lightweight model using Reciprocal Rank Fusion and LambdaMART that outperforms GPT-4 
5) Show context augmentation during plan generation reduces hallucination

In summary, the paper introduces context tuning to equip RAG systems with context-seeking abilities to handle incomplete queries. It shows the effectiveness of context tuning in improving contextual understanding and tool/plan retrieval for LLMs. The proposed lightweight context tuning model outperforms GPT-4 and context augmentation further reduces hallucinations.
