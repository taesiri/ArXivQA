# [Context Tuning for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) have remarkable ability to solve new tasks with few examples. However, they need access to the right tools and information to accomplish tasks effectively. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tries to provide relevant tools to LLMs by retrieving them based on the query. But RAG's tool retrieval relies on all necessary information being present in the query, which often fails for incomplete or lacking context queries.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Context Tuning for RAG, which uses a context retrieval system to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan generation (planning using LLMs). The context retrieval model uses numerical, categorical and usage signals to retrieve and rank relevant context items.

Main Contributions:
1) Show inadequacy of RAG for implicit/context-seeking queries; propose context tuning as solution
2) Compare various context retrieval methods on lightweight models and LLMs
3) Find that Chain of Thought (CoT) augmentation benefits context retrieval without fine-tuning, while fine-tuning removes need for it
4) Propose lightweight model using Reciprocal Rank Fusion and LambdaMART that outperforms GPT-4 
5) Show context augmentation during plan generation reduces hallucination

In summary, the paper introduces context tuning to equip RAG systems with context-seeking abilities to handle incomplete queries. It shows the effectiveness of context tuning in improving contextual understanding and tool/plan retrieval for LLMs. The proposed lightweight context tuning model outperforms GPT-4 and context augmentation further reduces hallucinations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a context tuning approach to improve tool retrieval and reduce hallucination in retrieval augmented language model based planners by retrieving relevant contextual information to enhance under-specified queries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution can be summarized as follows:

1. The paper empirically shows that traditional retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is inadequate for implicit/context-seeking queries and presents context tuning as a viable solution.

2. It provides a systematic comparison of various context retrieval methods applied on both lightweight models and large language models (LLMs). 

3. It shares the insight that chain of thought (CoT) augmentation improves context retrieval when no fine-tuning is applied to the retrieval model, whereas fine-tuning removes the need for CoT augmentation.

4. The paper proposes a lightweight model using reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) with LambdaMART that outperforms a GPT-4 based system for context retrieval.

5. It shows that context augmentation at the plan generation stage, even after tool retrieval, reduces hallucination by the LLM-based planner.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a context tuning component to enhance traditional RAG systems by providing them with essential context-seeking capabilities to handle incomplete or under-specified queries. This is achieved through comparisons of different context retrieval methods and proposing a lightweight yet effective context retrieval approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a context tuning component that improves tool retrieval and plan generation. How does context tuning specifically enhance the contextual understanding and context seeking abilities compared to traditional retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?

2) The paper shows empirically that chain of thought (CoT) augmentation improves context retrieval performance when no fine-tuning is applied. However, fine-tuning the retrieval model removes the need for CoT augmentation. What might explain why fine-tuning eliminates the benefits of CoT augmentation?  

3) The proposed approach uses LambdaMART with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF). What are the key advantages of using LambdaMART and RRF together compared to using them individually? How does this lightweight model outperform the GPT-4 based system?

4) The paper demonstrates a reduction in hallucination when augmenting context at the plan generation stage even after tool retrieval. What might account for this observation? How does additional context aid in reducing hallucinations?

5) The data generation methodology uses synthetic application data to simulate real-world scenarios. What are some limitations of using synthetic vs real user data? How might the use of synthetic data impact experimental conclusions? 

6) What other neural ranking models could be explored and compared to LambdaMART? Would incorporating neural rankers provide any benefits over tree-based rankers like LambdaMART? 

7) How exactly does the proposed context tuning methodology leverage numerical, categorical and habitual usage signals to retrieve and rank context items? What is the relative importance of each signal type?

8) How does the placement of supplementary information impact LLM plan generation? Does the context tuning approach account for optimal information placement when augmenting queries?

9) The paper focuses exclusively on single-turn instructions lacking conversation history. How would incorporating history aid in handling anaphora, ellipsis and topic shifts? What modifications would be needed?

10) What compression techniques could help extend the context tuning approach to accommodate longer context sequences that exceed the context window limitations of LLMs? How might these aid end-to-end performance?
