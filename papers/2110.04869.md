# [Global Vision Transformer Pruning with Hessian-Aware Saliency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04869)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve the efficiency of vision transformer (ViT) models by better redistributing parameters within and across ViT blocks. The key hypothesis is that the commonly used design of assigning uniform dimensions to all ViT blocks is suboptimal, and a better parameter distribution can lead to enhanced efficiency and accuracy tradeoff.

Specifically, the paper challenges the conventional wisdom of using the same dimension settings across all layers in a ViT model, and hypothesizes that redistributing parameters non-uniformly can allow the model to utilize its capacity more efficiently. It aims to systematically explore the potential for parameter redistribution in ViTs via a global structural pruning approach.

The main hypothesis is that global pruning can provide insights on the relative importance and redundancy of different components and layers in ViT models, guiding more efficient parameter allocation. By analyzing the pruned model architectures, the paper hopes to discover new design principles and heuristics for constructing more efficient vision transformers that outperform conventional uniform design.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the parameter distribution in ViT models is suboptimal and can be improved by leveraging the insights from global pruning, leading to enhanced efficiency and performance tradeoffs compared to the prevailing practice of using uniform dimensions. The paper aims to provide both empirical evidence through pruned models and analysis to shed light on efficient ViT design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing NViT, a novel hardware-friendly global structural pruning algorithm for Vision Transformers (ViTs). The pruning method uses a latency-aware, Hessian-based importance criteria to reduce parameters and FLOPs in a ViT model. 

- Performing a systematic analysis on the prunable components in a ViT model, including the embedding dimension, number of heads, MLP hidden dimension, etc. The paper shows these components have distinct sensitivity to pruning.

- Exploring hardware-friendly parameter redistribution in ViTs through the global pruning process. The paper discovers trends like high prunability of ViT models, unique parameter distribution across stacked ViT blocks, etc. 

- Achieving efficient ViT models named NViT through the pruning process that outperform prior work like DeiT, SWIN, and AutoFormer models in terms of accuracy under similar FLOPs and latency constraints.

- Providing insights on the differences in learning dynamics and architecture design principles between CNNs vs ViTs based on the global pruning study.

- Proposing a simple yet effective heuristic for redistributing ViT parameters based on the pruning insights, which leads to improved accuracy over DeiT models of similar sizes.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a novel ViT pruning method that provides insights on efficient ViT design and leads to more accurate yet hardware-friendly ViT models called NViT. The work also compares ViT vs CNN models and proposes simple heuristics for improved ViT architecture.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for vision transformer compression and parameter redistribution, where they utilize global structural pruning with a novel Hessian-based importance criteria to achieve near lossless compression on DeiT models, discover insights on parameter redistribution, and design more efficient vision transformer architectures that outperform prior art.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on vision transformers (ViTs), while much previous work on transformer pruning and efficiency has focused on natural language processing models like BERT. The authors argue that pruning ViTs poses unique challenges due to their more complex architecture.

- Prior work on ViT pruning like Zhu et al. and Chen et al. applied uniform sparsity ratios across all components and did not optimize directly for latency reduction. This paper introduces a global pruning approach tailored to ViTs that allows more flexibility in compressing different components and incorporates latency estimates.

- Compared to NAS-based methods like AutoFormer, this paper's approach explores the full design space continuously via iterative pruning rather than searching over a limited set of choices. The single pruning process is also lower cost than NAS supernet training.

- For model distillation, this paper distills from both a CNN teacher (as in DeiT) and the original unpruned ViT. Most prior work uses either a teacher or the original model.

- This paper provides detailed analysis into the trends discovered in effective ViT pruning, such as the importance of different components and how pruning affects parameter distribution across layers. This offers new architectural insights compared to past ViT compression methods.

- The proposed approach achieves significantly higher compression rates and speedups compared to previous state-of-the-art. For example, near lossless 2.6x FLOPs compression on DeiT-Base versus 2x for CNNs, and 1.9x speedup versus 1.6x.

Overall, this paper makes several novel contributions tailored to the ViT architecture and demonstrates notably improved efficiency over past work in ViT compression and design. The architectural insights from pruning could help guide more efficient ViT designs in the future.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring parameter redistribution and efficient model design with other vision transformer architectures besides DeiT. The authors focused their analysis on the DeiT architecture, but suggest their approach could also be applied to other ViT models.

- Combining token pruning methods with the structural pruning approach proposed in the paper for potentially greater efficiency gains. The authors mention token pruning techniques like EViT and DynamicViT as complementary approaches.

- Further analysis into the differences in learning dynamics and architecture design principles between CNNs and vision transformers. The authors observe differences like higher prunability, distinct parameter sensitivity within blocks, and a unique parameter redistribution trend in ViTs compared to CNNs. More research is needed to further understand these differences.

- Extending the Hessian-aware pruning approach to other model families and tasks beyond vision transformers for image classification. The proposed global structural pruning method is general, so could potentially be effective for other model types and tasks.

- Exploring joint training and architecture search for ViTs to discover architectures specialized for different downstream tasks. The authors show their redistribution rule works for both pretraining and downstream tasks, so joint training and search could find task-specific efficient models.

- Developing better transformers blocks tailored to vision through a co-design of architecture search techniques and novel transformer components. The authors use the standard ViT block, but new block types could further boost efficiency.

In summary, the main directions are around extending the pruning and redistribution framework to other models and tasks, co-designing model architecture innovations with automated search techniques, and further analysis into the differences between vision transformers and CNNs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes NViT, a novel method for compressing and redesigning Vision Transformer (ViT) models to improve their efficiency and accuracy trade-off. Starting from the DeiT model, the authors systematically analyze all prunable components including embedding size, number of heads, query/key size, value size, and MLP hidden size. They derive a new Hessian-based importance score to enable iterative, global structural pruning of all components across layers jointly. Incorporating estimated latency reduction further guides towards faster models on target hardware. This process provides a compressed family of NViT models that achieve superior accuracy and up to 1.9x speedup over original DeiT counterparts. Analyzing these compressed models reveals unique insights on ViT parameter sensitivity across layers and components. The authors further propose a heuristic for redistributing parameters across layers towards more efficient ViTs, achieving better accuracy than DeiT given similar model size. Key advantages of this work include the systematic pruning across all ViT components and layers, the hardware-aware training, and the unique parameter redistribution insights for ViT model design.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Vision Transformer (ViT) models have recently demonstrated competitive performance to CNNs on computer vision tasks. The original ViT model embeds image patches into tokens and passes them through transformer blocks for classification. Subsequent work has improved on ViT by incorporating inductive biases from CNNs during training, modifying the transformer architecture for better localization, and designing hierarchical multi-stage architectures. However, most ViT models uniformly allocate parameters across all layers in a model stage. This work explores redistributing parameters within and across transformer blocks to improve efficiency. 

The authors propose a global structural pruning method to analyze redundancy in ViT models and discover efficient architectures called NViT. By deriving a novel Hessian-based importance metric, they perform iterative pruning over all components in all layers jointly. This enables flexible exploration of the design space and reveals trends for better parameter allocation. The resulting NViT models significantly outperform prior work in efficiency-accuracy tradeoff. Analysis of the pruned models provides insights on ViT's high prunability, distinct sensitivity of components, and unique trend of redundancy across layers. Based on these observations, the authors propose a simple yet effective heuristic for parameter redistribution that further boosts efficiency.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Hessian-based global structural pruning method to redistribute parameters and discover efficient Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. The key ideas are:

1. They identify 5 prunable dimensions in ViT - embedding size, number of heads, QK size, V size, and MLP hidden size. Head alignment is used to enable consistent head pruning. 

2. A novel Hessian-based importance score is derived to enable comparability of the sensitivity of pruning different structures globally across all layers. Latency-aware regularization further guides pruning towards faster models.

3. Iterative pruning is performed over all dimensions jointly until a latency target is reached. This gives rise to a family of efficient ViT models named NViT.

4. Analysis on the pruned models discovers trends of parameter redistribution for more efficient ViTs: (i) V can be scaled separately from QK, (ii) attention modules are less important than MLP, (iii) parameter allocation is higher in middle layers than end layers.

5. A simple heuristic rule following the discovered trends leads to new ViT architectures ReViT that outperform DeiT counterparts. This demonstrates the viability of the insights from pruning towards guiding efficient model design.

In summary, the paper proposes a systematic Hessian-based pruning method to provide insights on better redistributing parameters across dimensions and layers in Vision Transformers, leading to more efficient model architectures.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of improving the efficiency and accuracy trade-off of Vision Transformer (ViT) models for computer vision tasks. Specifically:

- ViT models have multiple distinct components (e.g. multi-head attention, MLP) with independent dimensions. However, current models like ViT and DeiT use design heuristics from NLP which may not be optimal for computer vision. This leads to redundancy and suboptimal efficiency-accuracy tradeoff when scaling the models.

- Recent works have started pruning ViT models or designing efficient architectures. However, they use uniform pruning across components, do not consider runtime, or only search a limited architecture space. 

- There is potential to redistribute parameters across components and layers in ViT to achieve better efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, but this has not been explored before.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a global structural pruning method to analyze ViT models and discover efficient architectures by redistributing parameters. The goals are to understand which components are most important, explore the optimal way to distribute dimensions across components and layers, and derive insights to design better ViT architectures from scratch.
