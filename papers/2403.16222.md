# [Cyber-Security Knowledge Graph Generation by Hierarchical Nonnegative   Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Organizing and extracting meaningful information from large volumes of scientific papers is challenging. Knowledge graphs can store factual information in a structured way, but constructing them from unstructured scientific text is difficult.  
- Cybersecurity is a diverse, multidisciplinary field requiring more granular organization to discover sub-topics.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a concept for building domain-specific, multi-modal knowledge graphs using hierarchical and semantic non-negative matrix factorization (HSNMFk-SPLIT) to extract topics/clusters as ontology.
- Consolidate generic scientific corpora into a highly-specific cybersecurity domain and extract latent patterns to serve as ontology in the knowledge graph.
- HSNMFk-SPLIT hierarchically extracts fine-grained sub-topics and semantic sub-structures from large text datasets using joint factorization of text-document, word-context, and word-category matrices.
- Addresses computation overhead by distributing matrix factorization.

Main Contributions:
- Concept for building domain-specific knowledge graphs with latent ontology extracted via hierarchical topic modeling.
- HSNMFk-SPLIT method for hierarchical, semantic topic modeling and sub-topic extraction from large datasets.
- Demonstration of consolidating 2+ million arXiv papers into cybersecurity domain and extracting ontology with HSNMFk-SPLIT.
- Initial results showing HSNMFk-SPLIT can extract meaningful, interpretable topics and sub-topics for ontology.
- Feasibility of using method to build highly domain-specific knowledge graphs.

In summary, the key innovation is using hierarchical semantic NMF to extract latent ontology from scientific text to construct more useful, domain-specific knowledge graphs. The methods are demonstrated on a large corpus of arXiv papers consolidated into the cybersecurity field.
