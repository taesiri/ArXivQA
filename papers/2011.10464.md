# [A Reputation Mechanism Is All You Need: Collaborative Fairness and   Adversarial Robustness in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10464)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we achieve both collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness in federated learning simultaneously?The key points are:- Most existing federated learning frameworks do not adequately address collaborative fairness (participants getting rewards commensurate with contributions) and adversarial robustness (against attacks like poisoning and free-riding) together.- The authors propose a new federated learning framework called Robust and Fair Federated Learning (RFFL) that aims to achieve both goals via a reputation mechanism. - RFFL assigns each participant a reputation score based on their contribution, measured by similarity of their uploaded gradients to the aggregated gradients. This allows rewarding participants accordingly and identifying adversaries.- Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate RFFL can achieve high fairness, robustness against different attacks like poisoning and free-riding, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a reputation mechanism can help achieve collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness simultaneously in federated learning. The proposed RFFL framework is presented as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a new federated learning framework called "Robust and Fair Federated Learning" (RFFL) that aims to achieve two goals simultaneously:1. Collaborative fairness - Rewarding participants commensurate with their contributions to incentivize good behavior.2. Adversarial robustness - Protecting against free-riders who want to access the model without contributing and malicious adversaries who want to sabotage the model. The key ideas are:- Using a reputation mechanism to evaluate each participant's contributions based on the similarity of their uploaded gradients to the global model's gradients. - Rewarding participants with gradients more similar to global model with better versions of the final model.- Removing participants whose reputations fall below a threshold to deal with free-riders and adversaries.The proposed RFFL framework does not require any auxiliary validation datasets. Experiments on image and text classification benchmarks demonstrate RFFL can achieve high fairness, robustness against different attacks, and competitive accuracy compared to existing federated learning methods.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new federated learning framework that uniquely provides both collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this ICML 2021 paper compares to other research in federated learning:- The key focus of the paper is on achieving collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness together in federated learning. Most prior work has focused on one or the other, but not both simultaneously. So this addresses an important open research gap.- For collaborative fairness, the main related works are q-FFL, CFFL, and some papers on incentive mechanisms and profit sharing. Compared to q-FFL and CFFL, this paper's notion of using model performance as rewards is more intuitive and aligned with the motivations of self-interested participants. The profit sharing papers use a game-theoretic approach while this paper uses a reputation system. - For robustness, this paper considers targeted poisoning, untargeted poisoning, and free-riders. Related defenses exist for parts of this threat model, like Multi-Krum, Foolsgold, etc. But this paper provides a unified robustness solution via the reputation mechanism. The empirical evaluations are quite comprehensive.- The proposed RFFL framework is intuitive and doesn't require additional validation data like CFFL. The reputation system provides explainability on how participants are rewarded or penalized. The vector similarity for estimating contributions is also simple but effective per the results.- One limitation is that the defenses against label-flipping attacks seem to break down if the adversaries are the majority. This is a common challenge, and further research on detecting such advanced poisoning attacks would be useful.In summary, this paper makes solid contributions to an important open problem by proposing RFFL and providing extensive empirical evidence. The results look very promising compared to existing methods on fairness and robustness in federated learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Further investigating the potential trade-off between predictive performance, collaborative fairness, and adversarial robustness. The paper proposes the RFFL framework to achieve both collaborative fairness and robustness, but does not formally analyze the interactions between these three goals.- Improving robustness against more sophisticated adversaries whose gradients may be similar to honest participants with poor local data quality. The paper shows limitations in detecting label-flipping adversaries when they are in the majority. Better differentiating honest and adversarial gradients could help.- Exploring other choices for estimating contributions and rewards besides standalone performance. The paper uses standalone test accuracy as a proxy but notes other metrics could be considered. - Analyzing the theoretical convergence properties of the proposed reputation-weighted aggregation scheme. The paper evaluates it empirically but theoretical guarantees could be derived.- Considering personalized or group fairness notions instead of collaborative fairness based on overall contribution. The framework could be extended to account for differences in participant demographics.- Investigating incentivization schemes to further motivate participation, in addition to reputations and performance-based rewards. Game theory and economic mechanisms could be incorporated.- Testing the framework on a wider range of model architectures, data modalities, and adversarial attack strategies. The robustness and fairness properties should be validated more extensively.In summary, the authors suggest further theoretical analysis, extensions to the framework, and more rigorous empirical evaluation as directions for future work. The goal is to better understand the trade-offs involved and develop more advanced and practical fair and robust federated learning.

RFFL calculates participant contributions and rewards them accordingly to achieve fairness, and identifies non-contributing or malicious participants to remove for robustness. Experiments demonstrate RFFL's effectiveness on benchmark datasets. Overall, the paper proposes RFFL, a novel federated learning framework to achieve fairness and robustness without auxiliary validation data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:This paper proposes a new federated learning framework called Robust and Fair Federated Learning (RFFL) that aims to achieve both collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness. Most existing federated learning frameworks distribute the same final model to all participants regardless of their contributions, which can be unfair. Also, they lack safeguards against adversaries like free-riders and attackers, compromising the system's integrity. RFFL introduces a reputation mechanism that evaluates each participant's contributions by examining their uploaded gradients using vector similarity. It maintains reputations for each participant and removes those with low reputations as potential adversaries. During model aggregation, it weights participants' gradients by their reputations. During model distribution, participants receive model updates commensurate with their reputations, implemented via gradient sparsification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show RFFL achieves high fairness, robustness against different attacks like poisoning and free-riding, and competitive accuracy compared to baselines like FedAvg. The key novelty is achieving fairness and robustness simultaneously without needing an auxiliary validation dataset.
