# [A Reputation Mechanism Is All You Need: Collaborative Fairness and   Adversarial Robustness in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10464)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we achieve both collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness in federated learning simultaneously?The key points are:- Most existing federated learning frameworks do not adequately address collaborative fairness (participants getting rewards commensurate with contributions) and adversarial robustness (against attacks like poisoning and free-riding) together.- The authors propose a new federated learning framework called Robust and Fair Federated Learning (RFFL) that aims to achieve both goals via a reputation mechanism. - RFFL assigns each participant a reputation score based on their contribution, measured by similarity of their uploaded gradients to the aggregated gradients. This allows rewarding participants accordingly and identifying adversaries.- Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate RFFL can achieve high fairness, robustness against different attacks like poisoning and free-riding, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a reputation mechanism can help achieve collaborative fairness and adversarial robustness simultaneously in federated learning. The proposed RFFL framework is presented as a solution.
