# [One Shot Learning as Instruction Data Prospector for Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current practices for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) rely on expanding dataset size without ensuring data quality, which can introduce noise and degrade performance. 
- There is a lack of efficient, low-cost methods to identify optimal instruction data combinations within the vast data available to best align LLMs with human instructions.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Nuggets, a novel methodology that employs one shot learning to select high-quality instruction data from expansive datasets. 
- Nuggets assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to act as effective one shot examples for a diverse set of tasks. This identifies beneficial examples that can significantly enhance diverse task performance.
- It utilizes a scoring system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse anchor set of tasks. This facilitates selection of the most useful data for instruction tuning.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of Nuggets, an efficient method for LLM-based identification of valuable instruction tuning data from vast pools of candidates.
- Demonstration through extensive experiments that instruction tuning with just the top 1% of Nuggets-selected examples substantially outperforms using the full dataset.
- Providing evidence that focus should be on the quality and composition of instruction data rather than sheer quantity.
- Insight that one shot learning can serve as implicit instruction tuning to predict downstream tuning effects.
