# [Optimizing Negative Prompts for Enhanced Aesthetics and Fidelity in   Text-To-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image generation models can sometimes produce low-quality images with issues like blurriness and poor framing. Using negative prompts (describing unwanted image characteristics) can help divert models from these problems. 
- However, creating good negative prompts is tedious and manual. There are no existing methods to automatically optimize negative prompts.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose NegOpt, a new method to automatically optimize negative prompts to improve image quality. It has two phases:
   1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Fine-tune a seq2seq model to generate negative prompts from normal prompts using a new dataset called Negative Prompts DB.
   2) Reinforcement Learning (RL): Further optimize the model using RL to maximize a custom reward function based on image quality metrics. This allows targeting improvements in the most important metrics.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce NegOpt - the first approach to automatically optimize negative prompts for better text-to-image generation.
- Construct Negative Prompts DB - the first dataset aggregating negative prompts for training.
- Demonstrate significant gains over baselines in metrics like Inception Score (+25%) and Aesthetics Score. Can even surpass ground truth negative prompts.
- Show RL phase allows flexible optimization toward the most valued metrics without sacrificing others.
- Analysis provides insights into the efficacy of the SFT foundation and the importance of tailored RL-based optimization.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel two-phase technique to automatically generate high-quality negative prompts to enhance image aesthetics, fidelity and alignment in text-to-image generation. Both the new dataset and the customizable optimization approach are key contributions.
