# [Augment Before Copy-Paste: Data and Memory Efficiency-Oriented Instance   Segmentation Framework for Sport-scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instance segmentation is important for computer vision but faces challenges of insufficient annotated data and limited computational resources. 
- Effectively training models with limited data is an important research problem. 
- The VIPriors challenge introduces additional constraints - no use of pre-trained models or transfer learning.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a pipeline to incorporate visual inductive priors to optimize data preprocessing, augmentation and inference. 
- Use Canny-Hough lines to detect basketball court location, crop images to reduce size.
- Identify likely object identities based on location on court.
- Apply identity-based style transforms as augmentation, e.g. RGB transforms for players.
- Perform location-based copy-paste augmentation based on likely object positions.
- Only run inference on detected court region to save computation.

Main Contributions:
- Reduced image sizes by 34-41% through cropping, saving computation.
- Achieved 0.509 AP@0.50:0.95 with limited data and without pre-trained models, close to state-of-the-art.
- Used only 34.6% of memory compared to state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive performance.
- Demonstrated incorporating inductive priors through the pipeline is effective for optimizing limited data training.

In summary, the paper proposes an optimized pipeline leveraging domain-specific inductive priors that can effectively train on limited data for instance segmentation while saving substantially on computation and memory.
