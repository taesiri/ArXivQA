# [Bayesian Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for Large Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14664)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and learning (OPL) are important in contextual bandits for improving decision-making using logged data. 
- Existing methods like inverse propensity scoring (IPS) suffer from high variance in large action spaces. 
- Direct methods (DMs) can have bias but tend to have lower variance than IPS. However, standard DMs also struggle in large action spaces as they do not fully leverage correlations among actions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new Bayesian DM approach called BOLD that uses structured priors to capture correlations among actions. 
- This allows statistical strength to be shared across actions, enhancing efficiency.
- The structured prior involves a latent variable that encodes shared structure among action parameters. This maintains computational efficiency.  
- The posterior inference procedure is provided, covering both linear and non-linear cases.
- Greedy optimization is used for OPL based on a new metric called Bayesian Suboptimality that measures performance across problem instances.

Main Contributions:
- A Bayesian DM for OPE/OPL that uses structured priors to enable scalability to large action spaces while keeping computational efficiency.
- A general posterior inference framework applicable to both linear and non-linear reward models.  
- Introduction of Bayesian Suboptimality metric for OPL and justification for using greedy optimization to minimize it.
- Theoretical analysis of the Bayesian Mean Squared Error in OPE and Bayesian Suboptimality in OPL, highlighting benefits of structured priors.
- Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens datasets validating improved performance, especially in large action spaces.

In summary, the paper makes notable algorithmic, theoretical and experimental contributions by developing a Bayesian approach that leverages structured priors to effectively scale OPE/OPL to large action spaces.
