# [Exploring Automatic Text Simplification of German Narrative Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic text simplification for German is an understudied area with few available datasets, especially for longer, narrative texts. 
- Existing approaches have limitations in handling such texts.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply transformer-based natural language generation techniques (Longformer attention + pre-trained mBART model) to generate simplified German texts, focused on narratives.
- Explore fine-tuning the model on a new dataset of aligned German narrative texts from multiple sources. 
- Also try additional domain adaptation using unrelated German prose texts.

Contributions:
- Created and shared a new dataset for text simplification consisting of aligned German narrative texts from multiple sources.
- Showed that the existing mBART approach does not sufficiently solve German narrative text simplification. Both fine-tuning and domain adaptation hurt model performance.
- The model had issues with high repetition, incorrect factual changes, and improper handling of entities.
- Proposed several future research directions: investigating catastrophic forgetting, the repetition problem, using metadata, and comparing multilingual vs monolingual models.
- Demonstrated usefulness of entropy metrics to characterize issues with generated texts.
- Overall, moved forward text simplification for German narratives, while showing current methods are insufficient, requiring more research in this specific sub-area.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on this summary! I aimed to capture the key essence and contributions of the paper in a detailed yet accessible overview.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores applying transformer-based natural language generation techniques to the problem of German narrative text simplification, using Longformer attention and a pre-trained mBART model, but finds that existing approaches are not able to properly solve the task for German and points to several future research directions to address this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors apply existing transformer-based methods for text generation to the task of document-level text simplification for German. Specifically, they use a Longformer attention model with a pre-trained mBART model. This contributes methods and analysis for German text simplification, which is an understudied area.

2) They investigate the use of fine-tuning and domain adaptation for the text simplification task. Their experiments and analysis contribute knowledge about the effects of fine-tuning and domain adaptation on an mBART model for text simplification. 

3) They analyze the limitations of existing approaches for German text simplification, especially for longer narrative documents. They highlight issues like catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, the repetition problem, and inability of models to properly handle coreferences and named entities. 

4) They propose several directions for future work to address the limitations they found, including mitigating catastrophic forgetting, decoding methods to reduce repetition, using metadata to improve coreference handling, etc.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the understanding and methods for automatic text simplification for German, especially on longer narrative documents, through novel experiments and analysis of transformer-based models. The authors also contribute directions to guide future work in this area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Text simplification - The main focus of the paper is exploring automatic text simplification techniques for German narrative documents. This involves generating simpler versions of complex German texts.

- Natural Language Generation (NLG) - The paper applies transformer-based NLG techniques like Longformer attention and the mBART model for text simplification.

- German text simplification - The paper examines the landscape of existing datasets and approaches for German text simplification, which is an understudied area. 

- Narrative texts - Unique to this paper is a focus on simplifying German narrative texts specifically, like novels and fairy tales, rather than more commonly addressed domains like news.

- Fine-tuning - The paper fine-tunes a pretrained mBART model on a dataset of aligned German narrative documents at different reading levels.

- Domain adaptation - Additional pretraining of mBART on a domain-specific corpus of German prose texts.

- Evaluation - Quantitative evaluation of model outputs using metrics like BERTscore, BLEU, ROUGE, and entropy. Qualitative analysis also provided.

- Catastrophic forgetting - Analyzing why fine-tuning and domain adaptation hurt instead of helped model performance. Overwriting previous knowledge.

- Repetition problem - Issue of undesirably repeating text in the model outputs.

So in summary, key concepts span text simplification, transformers for NLG, German language, narratives, fine-tuning strategies, evaluation, and text generation challenges like catastrophic forgetting and repetition.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores automatic text simplification for German narrative documents. What unique characteristics of narrative texts make text simplification challenging compared to other document types? How does the methodology account for these challenges?

2. The paper uses a Longformer attention model together with a pretrained mBART model. What are the key benefits of using the Longformer attention mechanism in this context? How does it help address challenges with long document text simplification?

3. The paper finds that both fine-tuning and domain adaptation decrease model performance. What theories do the authors propose to explain this catastrophic forgetting? What mitigation strategies could help address this issue?  

4. The authors measure both semantic similarity and entropy metrics to evaluate model performance. Why is it valuable to consider both types of metrics? What specific insight does entropy provide about the models?

5. Repetition is a major problem observed in the generated simplified texts. The paper suggests some decoding-based and training-based methods to mitigate repetition from recent literature. How suitable are these methods for document-level text simplification? What challenges might they present?

6. The simplified versions of the narratives are targeted at audiences with lower literacy or cognitive disabilities. What ethical considerations does this present? Should the authors have discussed this further?

7. The paper analyzes issues with the model's simplifications using a passage from Der Sandmann. What are some of the key problems highlighted in this analysis? How could the model be improved to address them?  

8. The authors provide several promising future work areas such as catastrophic forgetting mitigation and controllability. Which of these directions do you think is the most impactful to pursue next? Why?

9. The paper uses only German language training data. How might incorporating multilingual data help or hurt model performance in this text simplification task? What tradeoffs are introduced?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on text simplification for literacy purposes. What other applications could this type of narrative document simplification provide value for? How might the methodology need to change to address those use cases?
