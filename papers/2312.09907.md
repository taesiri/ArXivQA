# [Exploring Automatic Text Simplification of German Narrative Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic text simplification for German is an understudied area with few available datasets, especially for longer, narrative texts. 
- Existing approaches have limitations in handling such texts.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply transformer-based natural language generation techniques (Longformer attention + pre-trained mBART model) to generate simplified German texts, focused on narratives.
- Explore fine-tuning the model on a new dataset of aligned German narrative texts from multiple sources. 
- Also try additional domain adaptation using unrelated German prose texts.

Contributions:
- Created and shared a new dataset for text simplification consisting of aligned German narrative texts from multiple sources.
- Showed that the existing mBART approach does not sufficiently solve German narrative text simplification. Both fine-tuning and domain adaptation hurt model performance.
- The model had issues with high repetition, incorrect factual changes, and improper handling of entities.
- Proposed several future research directions: investigating catastrophic forgetting, the repetition problem, using metadata, and comparing multilingual vs monolingual models.
- Demonstrated usefulness of entropy metrics to characterize issues with generated texts.
- Overall, moved forward text simplification for German narratives, while showing current methods are insufficient, requiring more research in this specific sub-area.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on this summary! I aimed to capture the key essence and contributions of the paper in a detailed yet accessible overview.
