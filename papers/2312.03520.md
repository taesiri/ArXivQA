# [Defense Against Adversarial Attacks using Convolutional Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03520)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a convolutional autoencoder-based defense against adversarial attacks on image classifiers. The methodology employs a U-shaped convolutional autoencoder that is trained to minimize the mean squared error between original and reconstructed images. During inference, adversarial images are fed into the autoencoder to remove perturbations and reconstruct images closely resembling the originals. Gaussian noise is also added to the latent representations to improve robustness. The reconstructed images are then classified using a pre-trained VGG-16 network. Experiments demonstrate the approach defends against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks, significantly restoring classifier accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. For example, for FGSM with Îµ=0.6, accuracy improves by 65.61% and 59.76% respectively. Comparisons also show the method provides higher accuracy and lower latency than recent state-of-the-art defenses. The work effectively showcases a convolutional autoencoder's capabilities for accurate and efficient defense against common adversarial attacks.
