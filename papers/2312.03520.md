# [Defense Against Adversarial Attacks using Convolutional Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03520)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a convolutional autoencoder-based defense against adversarial attacks on image classifiers. The methodology employs a U-shaped convolutional autoencoder that is trained to minimize the mean squared error between original and reconstructed images. During inference, adversarial images are fed into the autoencoder to remove perturbations and reconstruct images closely resembling the originals. Gaussian noise is also added to the latent representations to improve robustness. The reconstructed images are then classified using a pre-trained VGG-16 network. Experiments demonstrate the approach defends against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks, significantly restoring classifier accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. For example, for FGSM with Îµ=0.6, accuracy improves by 65.61% and 59.76% respectively. Comparisons also show the method provides higher accuracy and lower latency than recent state-of-the-art defenses. The work effectively showcases a convolutional autoencoder's capabilities for accurate and efficient defense against common adversarial attacks.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks, despite their state-of-the-art performance, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small perturbations in input data that cause models to make incorrect predictions. Two common attacks are the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). These attacks can compromise reliability of models, especially in safety-critical applications like self-driving cars. Thus defending against such attacks is an important area of research. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using a convolutional autoencoder to defend against FGSM and PGD attacks. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct clean, original images from adversarially perturbed inputs. During inference, adversarial images are passed through the autoencoder to remove perturbations and reconstruct images close to originals. These reconstructed images are then classified by a pre-trained VGG-16 model.  

A U-Net style convolutional autoencoder with Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activations is used. Random Gaussian noise is also added to latent representations to make the model more robust. The model is evaluated on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST image datasets under FGSM and PGD attacks with varying perturbation strengths.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates a convolutional autoencoder based defense against two common adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD)
- Achieves high accuracy in reconstructing clean images from adversarially perturbed inputs
- Significantly boosts classification accuracy on perturbed test data - by 65.61% and 89.88% on MNIST for FGSM and PGD attacks respectively
- Has very low inference latency compared to prior defense models such as Defense GANs and PuVAEs
- Provides promising direction for using autoencoders for defending deep learning models against adversarial attacks

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed defense methodology, the model design choices and training approach, evaluation results on benchmark datasets, comparisons to prior work, and the main contributions made by the paper.
