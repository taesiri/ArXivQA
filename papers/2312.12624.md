# [Building a Llama2-finetuned LLM for Odia Language Utilizing Domain   Knowledge Instruction Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the lack of capable natural language processing models for under-resourced Indic languages like Odia. Existing multilingual models often fail to effectively support Indic languages due to insufficient data representation and inability to understand local context. This is especially critical for generative AI applications.  

Proposed Solution  
The paper proposes:
1) Generating a large Odia instruction set containing domain knowledge to fine-tune language models.
2) Fine-tuning the Llama2 model using this instruction set to build an Odia language model tailored for enhanced performance.

Key Contributions:
- Compilation of a 181K Odia instruction set with domain knowledge translated from English instruction sets and Odia parallel corpus.
- Description of meticulous hyperparameter tuning and training of Llama2-7B using this instruction set to create specialized Odia model.  
- Benchmarking using automatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU along with human evaluation, demonstrating strengths and limitations.
- Release of model and instruction set to foster Odia NLP research.

The proposed approach serves as a template to build customized language models for low-resource Indic languages using domain-specific instruction tuning. By releasing the Odia model and instruction set, the paper facilitates similar efforts to promote other regional languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents the approach of generating a large Odia instruction set with domain knowledge data for fine-tuning the Llama2 model to enhance its performance in the Odia language domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an approach for i) generating a large Odia instruction set, including domain knowledge data suitable for LLM fine-tuning, and ii) building a Llama2-finetuned model tailored for enhanced performance in the Odia language domain.

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Creating an Odia instruction set containing 181K samples. This includes Odia domain knowledge data, translations of existing English instruction sets, and parallel corpus data.

2) Fine-tuning the Llama2-7B model on this Odia instruction set to create an LLM optimized for the Odia language. Details are provided on the fine-tuning methodology and parameters used.

3) Evaluating the fine-tuned Llama2 model using automatic metrics like BLEU and ROUGE as well as human evaluations. The model shows reasonably good performance on Odia language tasks.

4) Releasing the Odia instruction set and Llama2 fine-tuned model to the research community to aid future work on Odia language and Indic language LLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is the creation of resources (dataset and model) to help the development and performance of LLMs for the low-resource Odia language.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper appear to be:

Llama2, Llama1, Fine Tuning, Natural Language Processing, Odia, Generative AI, Large Language Models

The paper discusses building a Llama2-finetuned large language model (LLM) specifically for the Odia language by leveraging domain knowledge instruction sets. Key aspects covered in the paper include the dataset preparation, experimental setup and training, inference setup, evaluation, analysis, limitations, and conclusions of this specialized LLM. So the terms related to the Llama2 architecture, Odia language, instruction tuning, and evaluation of generative AI models seem to be the core keywords and terminology tied to this research.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using the IndicTrans machine translation library to translate instruction sets from English to Odia. What are some of the challenges faced when using machine translation for this task, especially for a low-resource language like Odia? How can the quality of the translated instruction sets be further improved?

2. The paper uses a batch size of 128 during fine-tuning. What is the rationale behind selecting this specific batch size? What trade-offs need to be considered when selecting the batch size and how does it impact model training and performance? 

3. LoRA (Learnable Reordering Attention) parameters are used during fine-tuning to refine the model's attention mechanisms. Can you explain in more detail how LoRA works and what advantages it provides over standard attention? How significantly does using LoRA improve the model's performance on Odia texts?

4. The paper mentions using 4-bit quantization during training. How exactly does quantization help improve efficiency and what challenges does it introduce? What were some of the considerations in deciding to use 4-bit quantization specifically?

5. What motivated the decision to use the Llama2 architecture as the base model instead of other popular choices like BERT or GPT-3? What unique capabilities does Llama2 have that make it well-suited for this Odia language model task?

6. The maximum token size seems to impact the model's ability to generate longer, more comprehensive responses. Can this constraint be adjusted or removed to allow longer responses? What trade-offs need to be considered?

7. For the human evaluation, readability, perplexity, and correctness metrics were used. Why were these specific metrics selected and what do they each tell us about the model's capabilities? What other metrics could additionally be useful?

8. The paper identifies some specific limitations around classifications tasks and generalization abilities. What techniques could help improve the model's performance in these areas? For example, would ensembling multiple models help?

9. What considerations need to be kept in mind regarding ethics, potential harms, and model transparency when developing and deploying such an Odia language model? What steps were taken in this work to address ethical concerns?

10. The appendix compares model performance to ChatGPT 3.5. Could a similar comparison analysis be done benchmarking against other multilingual models supporting Odia? What further comparative studies would be informative to understand current capabilities and opportunities for improvement?
