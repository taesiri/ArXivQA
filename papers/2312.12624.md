# [Building a Llama2-finetuned LLM for Odia Language Utilizing Domain   Knowledge Instruction Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the lack of capable natural language processing models for under-resourced Indic languages like Odia. Existing multilingual models often fail to effectively support Indic languages due to insufficient data representation and inability to understand local context. This is especially critical for generative AI applications.  

Proposed Solution  
The paper proposes:
1) Generating a large Odia instruction set containing domain knowledge to fine-tune language models.
2) Fine-tuning the Llama2 model using this instruction set to build an Odia language model tailored for enhanced performance.

Key Contributions:
- Compilation of a 181K Odia instruction set with domain knowledge translated from English instruction sets and Odia parallel corpus.
- Description of meticulous hyperparameter tuning and training of Llama2-7B using this instruction set to create specialized Odia model.  
- Benchmarking using automatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU along with human evaluation, demonstrating strengths and limitations.
- Release of model and instruction set to foster Odia NLP research.

The proposed approach serves as a template to build customized language models for low-resource Indic languages using domain-specific instruction tuning. By releasing the Odia model and instruction set, the paper facilitates similar efforts to promote other regional languages.
