# [Unifying and Certifying Top-Quality Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently there has been growing interest in generating multiple high-quality plans for practical applications. This has led to definitions of various related computational problems such as unordered top-quality planning, subset top-quality planning, and loopless top-k planning.
- Each problem is defined in an ad-hoc manner for specific issues identified by applications. It is impractical to specify each such problem separately. 

Proposed Solution:
- Unify the existing definitions into a single framework of "dominance top-quality planning" based on a dominance relation over plans. Different relations correspond to different computational problems.
- Certify that a set of plans meets the criteria for being a solution to a top-quality planning problem. This can be done by leveraging existing certification techniques for unsolvability and optimality.
- Show that existing task transformations can be used to efficiently certify unordered and subset top-quality planning without generating all dominated plans explicitly.
- Introduce a novel transformation to efficiently certify loopless top-quality planning by forbidding all plans with loops dominated by a given loopless plan.

Main Contributions:
- A unified definition of dominance top-quality planning that generalizes previous ad-hoc definitions
- Techniques to certify that a set of plans meets the criteria for being a solution to a top-quality planning problem
- Demonstrating how existing transformations can certify unordered and subset top-quality planning solutions 
- A new transformation for certifying loopless top-quality planning by forbidding dominated plans with loops

The key insight is that different top-quality planning problems can be expressed as dominance relations, allowing a unified treatment. Certification leverages task transformations and optimality certificates.
