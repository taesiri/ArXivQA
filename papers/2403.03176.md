# [Unifying and Certifying Top-Quality Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently there has been growing interest in generating multiple high-quality plans for practical applications. This has led to definitions of various related computational problems such as unordered top-quality planning, subset top-quality planning, and loopless top-k planning.
- Each problem is defined in an ad-hoc manner for specific issues identified by applications. It is impractical to specify each such problem separately. 

Proposed Solution:
- Unify the existing definitions into a single framework of "dominance top-quality planning" based on a dominance relation over plans. Different relations correspond to different computational problems.
- Certify that a set of plans meets the criteria for being a solution to a top-quality planning problem. This can be done by leveraging existing certification techniques for unsolvability and optimality.
- Show that existing task transformations can be used to efficiently certify unordered and subset top-quality planning without generating all dominated plans explicitly.
- Introduce a novel transformation to efficiently certify loopless top-quality planning by forbidding all plans with loops dominated by a given loopless plan.

Main Contributions:
- A unified definition of dominance top-quality planning that generalizes previous ad-hoc definitions
- Techniques to certify that a set of plans meets the criteria for being a solution to a top-quality planning problem
- Demonstrating how existing transformations can certify unordered and subset top-quality planning solutions 
- A new transformation for certifying loopless top-quality planning by forbidding dominated plans with loops

The key insight is that different top-quality planning problems can be expressed as dominance relations, allowing a unified treatment. Certification leverages task transformations and optimality certificates.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper unifies existing definitions of top-quality planning problems under a general framework of dominance relations, and shows how to certify solutions for such problems using task transformations and optimality certificates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Unifying existing top-quality planning problem definitions under a general framework of dominance relations. This allows viewing different problems like unordered, subset, and loopless top-quality planning as instances of the unified definition with different dominance relations.

2) Showing how solutions to dominance top-quality planning can be certified by leveraging existing certification techniques for optimal planning.

3) Introducing a novel transformation that allows efficiently certifying loopless top-quality planning solutions, closing a gap since no such transformation existed before.

In summary, the paper provides a unified view of top-quality planning, shows how solutions can be certified based on this, and enables certification for an important case (loopless planning) where it was previously lacking. The unified perspective and certification methods are the main contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Top-quality planning - The paper discusses computational problems related to finding sets of high-quality plans rather than just a single optimal plan.

- Dominance relations - The paper proposes unifying different top-quality planning problems using the concept of dominance relations over plans.

- Certification - A main contribution is showing how to certify that a set of plans meets the criteria to be a solution for various top-quality planning problems. 

- Task transformations - Existing work has transformations that forbid sets of plans, which can be leveraged for certification. The paper introduces a new transformation for loopless top-quality planning.

- Unsolvability certificates - The approach to certification builds on prior work on certifying unsolvability.

- Optimality certificates - Certifying top-quality solutions relies on being able to certify optimality.

- Unordered top-quality - One specific top-quality problem where action order does not matter.

- Subset top-quality - Finding smallest sets of plans representing all plans under a subset relation. 

- Loopless top-quality - Finding best quality loopless plans.

So in summary, the key focus is on unified certification of solutions for computational problems related to finding sets of high-quality plans.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified definition of top-quality planning problems based on a dominance relation. What are some examples of other possible dominance relations that could define new interesting top-quality planning problems?

2. The paper shows that existing task transformations for unordered and subset top-quality planning can be used for efficient certification. What modifications would need to be made to these transformations if a different dominance relation was used instead?

3. The novel task transformation introduced enables certification of loopless top-quality planning solutions. What are the key ideas behind this transformation and how does it differ from existing plan forbidding transformations? 

4. Could the proposed loopless task transformation also be used as a preprocessing step to speed up loopless top-quality planning in addition to certification? What difficulties may arise in using it that way?

5. The unified definition requires the solution set P to be minimal. What impact would removing this minimality condition have on the computational complexity and methods for solving and certifying solutions?

6. For top-k planning, the paper sketches a method for certification by partitioning the solution set P. Does an efficient direct certification method exist without needing to split P in this way?

7. What are some ways the certification methods proposed could be extended to probabilistic planning tasks where plan costs are uncertain?

8. Could the idea of using task transformations and optimality certificates be applied to certify solutions for other related planning problems besides top-quality and top-k planning?

9. The dominance relation defined for loopless planning does not require plans to be subsets in terms of actions. What advantage does this more general relation provide?

10. A key limitation mentioned is certifying search algorithms and heuristics for top-quality planning. What approaches could be taken to provide such certification in an efficient manner?
