# [Quantifying and Mitigating Unimodal Biases in Multimodal Large Language   Models: A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18346)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on vision-language tasks. However, they often suffer from over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g. language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers.

- Existing VQA datasets lack comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' reasoning abilities and their reliance on such biases. 

Proposed Solution:
- A causal framework is introduced to interpret and quantify the biases in VQA problems. A causal graph is defined to model the prediction process of MLLMs.

- A new dataset "MORE" is constructed with 12,000 VQA instances in multiple choice format. It requires multi-hop reasoning and aims to evaluate unimodal biases. Reasoning rationales are provided for interpretability.

- Two strategies are proposed to mitigate biases and enhance reasoning for MLLMs:
   1) A Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA) framework that explicitly guides limited-access MLLMs through multi-step reasoning.
   2) Fine-tuning open-source MLLMs on the MORE dataset with reasoning rationales.

Main Contributions:
- Causal framework to interpret and quantify language/vision biases in VQA
- MORE dataset to challenge MLLMs on overcoming those biases via multi-hop reasoning 
- DeVA framework and fine-tuned models to mitigate biases and enhance reasoning capabilities

The key goal is investigating and improving multimodal reasoning for large language models by quantifying the effects of biases and incorporating explainable multi-hop inference.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a causal framework to interpret and quantify biases in visual question answering, constructs a MORE dataset to challenge multimodal large language models to overcome reliance on unimodal biases via multi-hop reasoning, and offers strategies like the DeVA framework and fine-tuned LLaVA models to mitigate those biases and enhance reasoning abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a causal framework with a well-defined causal graph to interpret and quantify the biases (specifically language and vision biases) in visual question answering (VQA) problems. 

2. Constructing a new dataset called MORE that is designed to challenge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to overcome reliance on unimodal biases via multi-hop causal reasoning. The MORE dataset features external knowledge, multi-hop reasoning, unimodal bias evaluation, and rationales.

3. Proposing two strategies to mitigate the unimodal biases and enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs: (i) a Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA) framework that uses prompting for limited-access MLLMs, and (ii) fine-tuning of open-source MLLMs like LLaVA based on the MORE dataset and generated rationales.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a causal framework to interpret and quantify biases in VQA problems. Can you elaborate on how the causal graph is constructed and what key causal mechanisms it aims to capture? 

2. The paper introduces various interventions on images and questions to quantify the causal effects of unimodal biases. What is the intuition behind these interventions and how do they help assess model sensitivity and robustness?

3. The Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA) framework is proposed for limited-access models. Can you explain the motivation behind explicitly guiding models to reason step-by-step? How does retrieval augmentation help verify answers?

4. For open-source models, the paper fine-tunes LLaVA on the MORE dataset. How does incorporating causal rationales into the instructions during this process aim to enhance reasoning abilities?

5. The paper finds that current MLLMs still rely heavily on unimodal biases and struggle with precise semantic understanding. What open challenges do you think remain in improving multimodal reasoning?

6. How suitable do you think the proposed causal analysis framework would be for assessing biases and reasoning abilities in other multimodal tasks beyond VQA? What adaptations may be required?

7. The paper generates a knowledge-based dataset MORE using subgraph sampling from Wikidata5M. What are some limitations of this approach and how can dataset quality be further improved?  

8. What other intervention strategies could be explored under the proposed causal framework to quantify additional types of biases in MLLMs?

9. How can the extracted causal rationales be further refined, e.g. through additional machine or human input? What quality metrics need to be tracked?

10. The paper focuses on evaluating and improving reasoning for a single MLLM model. How could the framework be extended to assess ensemble models combining multiple different MLLMs?
