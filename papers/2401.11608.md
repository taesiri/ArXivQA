# [$\texttt{immrax}$: A Parallelizable and Differentiable Toolbox for   Interval Analysis and Mixed Monotone Reachability in JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Interval analysis and reachable set estimation are important techniques for robustness analysis and control of uncertain systems. However, most existing implementations lack computational efficiency and scalability. Specifically, they do not utilize modern advancements like GPU parallelization and automatic differentiation.

- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, GPU acceleration, and automatic differentiation are key features provided by the JAX library for efficient numerical computing. However, JAX lacks native support for interval analysis and reachability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents immrax, a Python toolbox for interval analysis and reachability analysis that is fully composable with JAX. 

- It introduces new function transforms in JAX for constructing inclusion functions and embedding systems which overapproximate a system's reachable sets. These transforms inherit JAX's computational benefits like JIT compilation, GPU parallelization, and automatic differentiation.

Main Contributions:

- Novel proof for a mixed Jacobian-based inclusion function that better captures stabilizing effects in closed-loop systems compared to standard approaches.

- Introduction of composable JAX transforms for inclusion functions and embedding systems that are compatible with existing JAX transformations like JIT, vmap, grad.

- Case studies demonstrating order-of-magnitude computational speedups using JIT compilation and substantial additional gains from GPU parallelization.

- Example application automatically computing locally optimal robust controllers for a pendulum swing-up task using automatic differentiation of the reachability-based cost and constraints.

In summary, the paper presents immrax, a toolbox enabling efficient interval analysis and reachable set estimation fully integrated with JAX, unlocking modern computational techniques for these classical formal methods. The efficiency and differentiability open up new possibilities for reachability-based learning and control.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The mixed Jacobian-based inclusion function in Proposition 3 uses a novel proof technique compared to standard references. How does this new proof help capture stabilizing effects in the analysis of closed-loop systems? Can you provide a specific example where this is beneficial?

2) The GPU parallelization results in Table 2 show worse performance than CPU for a single partition, but better scaling to multiple partitions. What causes this performance crossover? How could the implementation be improved to achieve better GPU performance, even for a single partition? 

3) The closed-loop inclusion function for the vehicle model controlled by a neural network (Equation 4) combines linear bounds from CROWN with the mixed Jacobian-based approach. Why is this combination helpful? What limitations does it have?

4) Automatic differentiation is used to compute gradients and Hessians for the robust optimal control problem formulation in Section 4.2. Could algorithmic differentiation methods like forward/reverse mode be used instead? What are the tradeoffs? 

5) What solvers could be used instead of IPOPT to solve the robust optimal control problem for the pendulum? How do the merits of interior point vs. active set methods apply in this context?

6) The interval bounds help curb over-conservative reachable set estimations. However, what risks are there in using the interval width in the objective function? Could this lead to issues with the optimization?

7) How does the treatment of disturbances in the closed-loop inclusion function and embedding system differ? What are the tradeoffs of the two approaches?

8) The toolbox supports composability with many JAX transforms, but what about new transforms that arise in the future? What would need to be done to ensure continued compatibility?

9) The case studies focus on continuous time systems. What changes would be needed to handle discrete time/hybrid systems instead?

10) The toolbox shows promise for robust training of learning-enabled controllers. What modifications could make the algorithms more tailored and efficient for use with machine learning?
