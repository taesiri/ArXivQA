## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Pushing in the Dark: A Reactive Pushing Strategy for Mobile Robots Using Tactile Feedback":

Problem:
Pushing objects is an important capability for mobile robots operating in cluttered environments. However, the unpredictable behavior and varying physical properties of objects significantly complicates pushing tasks. Existing methods either rely on assumptions about object properties or require modeling/learning the object behavior, limiting their applicability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel Reactive Pushing Strategy that allows a mobile robot to dynamically adjust its motions based on tactile feedback to successfully push objects to target locations. The key aspects are:

- Uses a tactile sensor covering the robot's base to detect contact location with pushed object, eliminating need for object pose estimation. 

- Generates reactive motions combining forward velocity magnitude, adaptive rate for lateral velocity, and angular velocity based on contact location and remaining distance to target.

- Switches between regular pushing and a Realignment State that recenters object when contact location approaches edges.  

- Does not require modeling or assumptions about object physical properties.

Main Contributions:

- Introduced reactive pushing strategy that relies only on tactile contact location feedback, without needing object pose or property information.

- Showed through simulations that the strategy achieves significantly higher success rate in pushing varied objects to different target locations compared to non-reactive pushing and a state-of-the-art method.

- Validated real-world effectiveness through experiments with different objects and challenging target locations.

- Demonstrated capability to handle transitions between point and line contacts, changes in contact locations, and objects with asymmetric mass distributions.

The key novelty is the reactive pushing strategy that adapts motions based on tactile feedback, eliminating dependencies on object assumptions or modeling while still enabling precise position control.
