# [Adaptive Shape-Servoing for Vision-based Robotic Manipulation with Model   Estimation and Performance Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06340)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel manipulation framework for deformable objects, specifically elastic rods, that operates in a model-free manner without requiring prior knowledge of the robot, camera, or object. The key components include 1) a shape feature extraction method to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the object's shape, 2) an online estimation algorithm called Adaptive Kalman Filtering (AKF) to approximate the differential relationship (deformation Jacobian matrix) between the robot's motion and the object's shape change, and 3) a model-free adaptive controller with performance regulation that commands the robot's movement to achieve desired object deformations. The controller optimizes multiple criteria related to deformation error, deformation rate, robot motion smoothness, etc. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to prior methods, with faster convergence speeds near the origin and under various operating conditions. By not relying on analytical models and using only input-output data, the presented framework enhances the capability for autonomous manipulation of deformable objects.
