# Towards Generalist Robots: A Promising Paradigm via Generative
  Simulation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question or hypothesis of this paper seems to be:How can we leverage large-scale simulations and the generative capabilities of large language models (LMMs) to enable robotic agents to learn a diverse range of low-level motor skills, with the ultimate goal of creating generalist robots that can perform many different tasks? The key ideas seem to be:- Leveraging LMMs like GPT-3/4 to automatically generate a large diversity of tasks, scenes, and training supervisions (e.g. reward functions) for simulations.- Using simulation at scale to enable massive amounts of trial-and-error practice for robotic agents to acquire low-level motor skills through RL, trajectory optimization, etc. - Combining task-specific policies trained in simulation into a single generalist policy model conditioned on visual input and language instructions.- This "generative simulation" approach could allow creating generalist robots with a foundation of diverse low-level skills that can be activated based on high-level instructions.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that this automated generative simulation approach can enable scaling up motor skill learning to the level needed for generalist robotic agents. The paper aims to lay out this vision and propose it as a promising research direction.
