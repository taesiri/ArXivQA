# Towards Generalist Robots: A Promising Paradigm via Generative   Simulation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question or hypothesis of this paper seems to be:How can we leverage large-scale simulations and the generative capabilities of large language models (LMMs) to enable robotic agents to learn a diverse range of low-level motor skills, with the ultimate goal of creating generalist robots that can perform many different tasks? The key ideas seem to be:- Leveraging LMMs like GPT-3/4 to automatically generate a large diversity of tasks, scenes, and training supervisions (e.g. reward functions) for simulations.- Using simulation at scale to enable massive amounts of trial-and-error practice for robotic agents to acquire low-level motor skills through RL, trajectory optimization, etc. - Combining task-specific policies trained in simulation into a single generalist policy model conditioned on visual input and language instructions.- This "generative simulation" approach could allow creating generalist robots with a foundation of diverse low-level skills that can be activated based on high-level instructions.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that this automated generative simulation approach can enable scaling up motor skill learning to the level needed for generalist robotic agents. The paper aims to lay out this vision and propose it as a promising research direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a new paradigm called "generative simulation" for scaling up robotic skill learning. The key idea is to leverage large language models (LMMs) to automatically generate diverse tasks and scenes in simulation.- Outlining a pipeline for how LMMs can be used to generate sub-tasks, scene components, scene configurations, textures/objects/dynamics, and reward functions. This allows creating a large and diverse dataset of tasks and scenes for robots to practice in simulation.- Arguing that generative simulation can help overcome limitations of real world data collection and current simulation methods to acquire a broad repertoire of low-level motor skills. This could be a promising path towards generalist robots.- Highlighting that each component needed for the proposed approach is within reach based on recent advances in language models, generative models, simulation, etc. The authors believe bringing together these parts could enable major progress.- Sharing an exciting new vision and research direction to spur discussions and advancements in robotic skill learning. The paper serves as a position paper rather than reporting concrete results.In summary, the core contribution is proposing the generative simulation paradigm for automated and scalable robotic skill acquisition by harnessing multimodal foundation models. This is presented as a promising approach to make progress towards the grand goal of generalist robotics.
