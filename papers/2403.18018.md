# [DORE: A Dataset For Portuguese Definition Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Definition modeling (DM) is an important task with applications like automatic dictionary creation, but it relies on large datasets of word-definition pairs.
- While datasets exist for English and some other languages, there are no Portuguese DM datasets. Portuguese has over 200 million native speakers, so a dataset would be valuable.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce DORE, the first Portuguese DM dataset with over 100,000 definitions extracted from Dicio and Portuguese Wiktionary.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of DORE, the first Portuguese DM dataset with 103,019 definitions and 27,978 unique words.
- Evaluation of several neural DM models on DORE, including mBERT, XLM-Roberta, BERTimbau, mBART, mT5 variants, and large language models like GPT, Falcon, and Llama.
- GPT achieved the best results, showing the power of large pre-trained models for low-resource DM through zero-shot prompting. 
- Public release of DORE to spur more Portuguese NLP research. The dataset and models are available under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

In summary, the authors filled the gap of no Portuguese DM datasets by creating DORE and showed strong baseline DM results on it with the latest neural models. The public release of DORE will enable more Portuguese NLP research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces DORE, the first Portuguese dataset for definition modeling containing over 100,000 definitions, evaluates several neural and large language models on this dataset, and makes the dataset and models publicly available to foster research in Portuguese language tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing DORE, the first dataset for Portuguese definition modelling, which comprises 103,019 definitions. The paper describes the steps taken to compile this dataset.

2. Evaluating several neural DM methods on DORE and reporting the results.

3. For the first time, evaluating several popular large language models (LLMs) on DM using prompting to generate definitions and comparing the results. 

4. Releasing DORE as an open-access dataset alongside the trained machine learning models.

So in summary, the main contribution is creating and releasing the first dataset for automatic definition generation in Portuguese (DORE), evaluating various neural DM methods on this dataset, and releasing the dataset and models publicly to foster more research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with it are:

Portuguese dataset, automatic generation of definitions, definition modelling, transfer learning, pretrained models.

These keywords are listed explicitly at the end of the abstract in the paper:

"\Keywords{Portuguese dataset, automatic generation of definitions, definition modelling, transfer learning, pretrained models.}"

So those appear to be the main key terms and keywords that summarize and categorize the key topics covered in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces DORE, the first Portuguese dataset for definition modeling. What were the key challenges in creating this dataset and how did the authors address them? 

2. The paper experiments with several neural definition modeling methods on DORE. Can you explain the differences between the general transformer models and text generation transformer models used? What were the advantages of using text generation transformers?

3. The authors find that language models designed specifically for text generation perform the best on the Portuguese definition modeling task. Why do you think this is the case? What specifically about these models makes them well-suited to this task?

4. The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) on definition modeling through zero-shot prompting. Can you explain this approach and why it allows LLMs to be assessed for low-resource languages? 

5. GPT slightly outperformed the other LLMs in the experiments. What architectural or design aspects of GPT may account for this result? 

6. The paper uses BLEU, TER, BLEURT and BERTScore to evaluate model performance. Can you discuss the pros and cons of these metrics for assessing quality of definitions generated?

7. One interesting finding is that BERTimbau, a model specifically trained on Portuguese text, gave the worst results. Why do you think this occurred and how could a Portuguese-specific model be improved?

8. How suitable or effective were the prompts designed for harnessing the LLMs' capabilities? Could the prompts be improved and if so, how?

9. The authors plan to expand DORE with more definitions and context examples. How do you think this would impact model performance? What other data could prove useful?  

10. The paper demonstrates DORE's utility through Portuguese definition modeling experiments. What other NLP tasks could benefit from this dataset? How else might DORE promote Portuguese language research?
