# [Improving Continuous Sign Language Recognition with Cross-Lingual Signs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can multilingual sign language corpora be utilized to improve the performance of continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) models, particularly for low-resource sign languages? The key hypothesis seems to be:By identifying "cross-lingual" signs that are visually similar across different sign languages, an auxiliary dataset in one sign language can be mapped and incorporated into the training of a CSLR model in another sign language in order to improve its recognition capability.In particular, the paper explores using a larger Chinese sign language dataset to improve CSLR models for German sign language, which has more limited training data. The main contributions revolve around developing methods to construct isolated sign dictionaries from continuous datasets, identify cross-lingual mappings between signs in the two languages, and effectively combine the multilingual data to train improved CSLR models. The experiments aim to validate that their proposed cross-lingual training approach can advance the state-of-the-art in CSLR.In summary, the core research question is how cross-lingual transfer can help address data scarcity issues in developing CSLR systems for low-resource sign languages. The central hypothesis is that leveraging auxiliary sign language data and visual sign similarities can improve model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be a method for improving monolingual continuous sign language recognition by utilizing multilingual sign language corpora and identifying cross-lingual signs. Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:- Building sign language dictionaries from continuous sign language datasets using pre-trained CSLR models to automatically segment the data.- Identifying cross-lingual sign mappings between different sign languages using an optimized isolated sign language recognition model. - Training the CSLR model on a combination of the target language dataset with original labels and an auxiliary language dataset with mapped labels.The main novelty appears to be using the discovery of cross-lingual signs, which are visually similar signs that occur across different sign languages, to improve monolingual CSLR performance. By identifying these cross-lingual mappings and incorporating the auxiliary multilingual data into training, the authors are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on two CSLR benchmarks.In summary, the core contribution seems to be presenting a way to utilize multilingual corpora and leverage cross-lingual sign similarities to address the data scarcity problem in continuous sign language recognition. The proposed techniques for dictionary construction, mapping identification, and joint training enable effective transfer and improvement over monolingual models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in continuous sign language recognition:- Data scarcity has been a major challenge in CSLR. Many previous works have tried to improve recognition with small monolingual datasets, while this paper explores using multilingual data. This cross-lingual approach is novel for CSLR. - The idea of identifying and leveraging cross-lingual signs between different sign languages is new. Prior CSLR works have not explicitly explored or exploited this.- This paper presents an end-to-end framework for incorporating a multilingual dataset into CSLR training through cross-lingual sign mapping. The overall methodology is comprehensive and unprecedented. - They achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmark CSLR datasets by using their cross-lingual approach. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed techniques.- Most prior works on cross-lingual transfer for sign language understanding have focused on isolated sign recognition or machine translation. This work is one of the first to show gains from cross-lingual training for continuous recognition.- Compared to other cross-lingual CSLR works like Tornay et al., this paper better utilizes both the target and auxiliary datasets by learning optimized cross-lingual mappings.In summary, the key novelties are using multilingual data and cross-lingual signs for improving monolingual CSLR, proposing an end-to-end framework for this, and showing significant improvements over monolingual baselines. This opens up a new direction for tackling data constraints in CSLR.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding the approach to more sign languages. The current work only explores using Chinese Sign Language (CSL) and German Sign Language (DGS) datasets. The authors suggest applying the method to more sign language pairs as more continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) datasets become available. - Exploring semi-supervised and unsupervised cross-lingual transfer learning. The current approach relies on having sequence-level annotations in both the source and target sign language datasets. The authors suggest investigating ways to exploit unlabeled auxiliary datasets to further enrich the training data.- Enhancing the sign-to-sign mapping model. The current mapping is identified using a basic isolated sign classification model. The authors suggest exploring more sophisticated mapping models that can better handle sign variations and capture finer-grained cross-lingual similarities. - Incorporating linguistic knowledge. The current visual-based mapping does not consider linguistic information like word meanings. The authors suggest incorporating linguistic knowledge, when available, to improve mapping quality, especially for signs with similar visual appearance.- Multi-task and curriculum learning. The authors suggest exploring multi-task learning frameworks that combine related tasks like isolated sign recognition and continuous sign recognition. Curriculum learning could also help adapt models trained on isolated signs to the continuous recognition task.- Low-resource sign language recognition. The authors suggest evaluating their cross-lingual transfer approach in extremely low-resource scenarios where the target language has very limited data.In summary, the main future directions are centered around expanding the approach to more languages, incorporating more auxiliary data, and improving the cross-lingual mapping model itself.
