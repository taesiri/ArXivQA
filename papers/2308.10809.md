# [Improving Continuous Sign Language Recognition with Cross-Lingual Signs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can multilingual sign language corpora be utilized to improve the performance of continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) models, particularly for low-resource sign languages? The key hypothesis seems to be:By identifying "cross-lingual" signs that are visually similar across different sign languages, an auxiliary dataset in one sign language can be mapped and incorporated into the training of a CSLR model in another sign language in order to improve its recognition capability.In particular, the paper explores using a larger Chinese sign language dataset to improve CSLR models for German sign language, which has more limited training data. The main contributions revolve around developing methods to construct isolated sign dictionaries from continuous datasets, identify cross-lingual mappings between signs in the two languages, and effectively combine the multilingual data to train improved CSLR models. The experiments aim to validate that their proposed cross-lingual training approach can advance the state-of-the-art in CSLR.In summary, the core research question is how cross-lingual transfer can help address data scarcity issues in developing CSLR systems for low-resource sign languages. The central hypothesis is that leveraging auxiliary sign language data and visual sign similarities can improve model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be a method for improving monolingual continuous sign language recognition by utilizing multilingual sign language corpora and identifying cross-lingual signs. Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:- Building sign language dictionaries from continuous sign language datasets using pre-trained CSLR models to automatically segment the data.- Identifying cross-lingual sign mappings between different sign languages using an optimized isolated sign language recognition model. - Training the CSLR model on a combination of the target language dataset with original labels and an auxiliary language dataset with mapped labels.The main novelty appears to be using the discovery of cross-lingual signs, which are visually similar signs that occur across different sign languages, to improve monolingual CSLR performance. By identifying these cross-lingual mappings and incorporating the auxiliary multilingual data into training, the authors are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on two CSLR benchmarks.In summary, the core contribution seems to be presenting a way to utilize multilingual corpora and leverage cross-lingual sign similarities to address the data scarcity problem in continuous sign language recognition. The proposed techniques for dictionary construction, mapping identification, and joint training enable effective transfer and improvement over monolingual models.
