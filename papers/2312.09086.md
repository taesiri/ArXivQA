# [COMBHelper: A Neural Approach to Reduce Search Space for Graph   Combinatorial Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09086)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel neural framework called COMBHelper to improve the efficiency of existing combinatorial optimization (CO) algorithms for graph problems. COMBHelper employs a graph neural network (GNN) to identify promising nodes likely to be included in the optimal solution, thereby pruning the search space fed into traditional CO algorithms. Further efficiencies are gained through a knowledge distillation module to compress the GNN and a problem-specific boosting module to focus on misclassified nodes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate COMBHelper reduces running times of algorithms like linear programming, greedy search, and local search by over 2x on problems like minimum vertex cover and maximum independent set. The reduced search spaces provide high solution quality - often matching or exceeding baseline algorithms. By effectively pruning the search space via learned GNN node classifications, COMBHelper serves as a general accelerator for traditional approaches to intractable combinatorial optimizations on graphs.
