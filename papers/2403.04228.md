# [Single-Image HDR Reconstruction Assisted Ghost Suppression and Detail   Preservation Network for Multi-Exposure HDR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing high dynamic range (HDR) images from multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images is challenging, especially for dynamic scenes. Key issues are preserving information in oversaturated regions, avoiding ghosting artifacts due to object motions, and recovering lost details. Existing methods struggle to effectively address these challenges simultaneously.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an end-to-end dual-branch network consisting of:

1) Single-frame HDR reconstruction with enhanced stop image (SHDR-ESI): Integrates a detail enhancement mechanism with self- and mutual-representation modules to highlight and aggregate crucial information from both the reference image and enhancement stop image (ESI). ESI provides complementary details for oversaturated regions.  

2) SHDR-ESI assisted multi-exposure HDR reconstruction (SHDR-A-MHDR): Employs a feature interaction fusion module (FIFM) to selectively merge multi-exposure features and a ghost suppression module (GSM) guided by SHDR-ESI's intermediate features to suppress ghosting artifacts.

SHDR-ESI provides ghost-free HDR reconstruction to guide SHDR-A-MHDR in suppressing inconsistent information while preserving shared details between inputs. The unidirectional promotion between the two branches achieves simultaneous ghost suppression, detail preservation and recovery.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new paradigm to integrate ghost suppression, detail preservation and recovery within a unified network for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. 
- Designs effective modules in SHDR-ESI to highlight and aggregate crucial information from reference image and ESI, preventing detail loss.
- Develops FIFM and GSM modules in SHDR-A-MHDR to selectively merge multi-exposure features and leverage SHDR-ESI's ghost-free outputs for ghost suppression.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple HDR reconstruction datasets, demonstrating efficacy in simultaneously addressing major challenges.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in multi-exposure HDR reconstruction for dynamic scenes via an innovative dual-branch promotion framework for simultaneous ghost suppression and detail preservation/recovery.
