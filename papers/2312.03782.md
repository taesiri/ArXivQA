# [Novel class discovery meets foundation models for 3D semantic   segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the novel problem of novel class discovery (NCD) for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. NCD refers to the task of discovering and segmenting novel classes in a dataset that were not seen during training. Extending existing NCD methods from 2D images to 3D point clouds is non-trivial due to different assumptions and challenges in the 3D domain. For example, a single 3D scene may contain multiple novel classes, and there is no clear foreground/background separation.

Method: 
The paper proposes a new method called SNOPS that effectively combines online clustering, uncertainty modeling, and distillation from a 3D foundation model (OpenScene) for NCD in point clouds. Specifically, SNOPS concurrently learns to segment both base (labeled) and novel (unlabeled) classes by alternating between self-supervised pseudo-label generation via optimal transport and distillation of semantic knowledge from the foundation model OpenScene. A class-balanced queue is used during training to retain features for novel classes that may be under-represented. The method also employs uncertainty estimation to filter noisy pseudo-labels.

Contributions:
- Introduces the novel task of NCD for 3D point cloud segmentation and a new benchmark protocol.
- Empirically proves that solely relying on a 3D foundation model's zero-shot segmentation is insufficient.
- Proposes SNOPS, which synergizes NCD with semantic knowledge distillation, advancing state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud NCD.
- Demonstrates SNOPS's superiority over baseline methods on SemanticKITTI, SemanticPOSS and S3DIS datasets through extensive experiments.

The key novelty is effectively combining strengths of online clustering, uncertainty modeling, and representation learning via foundation models tailored for the new problem of NCD in 3D point cloud segmentation.
