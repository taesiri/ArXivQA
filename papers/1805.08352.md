# Controlling Personality-Based Stylistic Variation with Neural Natural   Language Generators

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can neural network architectures for natural language generation be designed to disentangle style from content, in order to simultaneously achieve high fidelity to both stylistic and semantic goals?Specifically, the paper investigates different neural network architectures and evaluates how well they are able to generate utterances that preserve semantic content while exhibiting desired stylistic variations corresponding to models of personality. The central hypothesis is that providing explicit stylistic supervision to neural generators, even with a large training corpus, can improve performance on both semantic and stylistic measures. The paper presents results supporting this hypothesis through experiments with different model architectures using a novel parallel corpus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing neural network models that can generate text with controlled stylistic variation while maintaining semantic fidelity. Specifically:- They created a large parallel corpus of over 88,000 utterances in the restaurant domain with different styles based on personality models, using the Personage statistical generator. This allows control over both the semantics and styles in the training data.- They designed 3 neural network models with increasing levels of explicit stylistic supervision:    - Model_NoSupervision: baseline seq2seq model    - Model_Token: adds a token to encode personality    - Model_Context: adds an encoding of stylistic parameters to the network- They evaluated the models on semantic fidelity (errors, entropy, pragmatics) and stylistic variation (pragmatics, aggregation). - Model_Context performs the best on both semantic and stylistic metrics, showing benefits of explicit stylistic supervision even with a large training set.- The models can generate distinguishable personality styles. Model_Context can also generate novel combinations of styles that weren't seen during training.In summary, the key contribution is developing neural generation models that can disentangle content from style by controlling multiple stylistic parameters, enabled by creating a large stylistically varied training corpus using Personage. The results show the benefits of explicit stylistic supervision for faithful style transfer in neural NLG.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents three sequence-to-sequence neural network models for controlling stylistic variation in natural language generation while maintaining semantic fidelity, using a large novel training corpus synthesized by the Personage generator that varies content by personality, and shows that explicit encoding of stylistic parameters helps produce outputs that are both semantically accurate and stylistically varied.
