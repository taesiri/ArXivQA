# [Controlling Personality-Based Stylistic Variation with Neural Natural   Language Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08352)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can neural network architectures for natural language generation be designed to disentangle style from content, in order to simultaneously achieve high fidelity to both stylistic and semantic goals?

Specifically, the paper investigates different neural network architectures and evaluates how well they are able to generate utterances that preserve semantic content while exhibiting desired stylistic variations corresponding to models of personality. The central hypothesis is that providing explicit stylistic supervision to neural generators, even with a large training corpus, can improve performance on both semantic and stylistic measures. The paper presents results supporting this hypothesis through experiments with different model architectures using a novel parallel corpus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing neural network models that can generate text with controlled stylistic variation while maintaining semantic fidelity. Specifically:

- They created a large parallel corpus of over 88,000 utterances in the restaurant domain with different styles based on personality models, using the Personage statistical generator. This allows control over both the semantics and styles in the training data.

- They designed 3 neural network models with increasing levels of explicit stylistic supervision:
    - Model_NoSupervision: baseline seq2seq model
    - Model_Token: adds a token to encode personality
    - Model_Context: adds an encoding of stylistic parameters to the network

- They evaluated the models on semantic fidelity (errors, entropy, pragmatics) and stylistic variation (pragmatics, aggregation). 

- Model_Context performs the best on both semantic and stylistic metrics, showing benefits of explicit stylistic supervision even with a large training set.

- The models can generate distinguishable personality styles. Model_Context can also generate novel combinations of styles that weren't seen during training.

In summary, the key contribution is developing neural generation models that can disentangle content from style by controlling multiple stylistic parameters, enabled by creating a large stylistically varied training corpus using Personage. The results show the benefits of explicit stylistic supervision for faithful style transfer in neural NLG.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents three sequence-to-sequence neural network models for controlling stylistic variation in natural language generation while maintaining semantic fidelity, using a large novel training corpus synthesized by the Personage generator that varies content by personality, and shows that explicit encoding of stylistic parameters helps produce outputs that are both semantically accurate and stylistically varied.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper focuses on controlling stylistic variation in neural natural language generation models, while maintaining semantic fidelity. Much previous work on style in NLG has been in the context of "style transfer", where it is difficult to measure content preservation. This paper addresses that issue through the use of a meaning representation.

- The paper creates a large parallel corpus of over 88,000 utterances that vary stylistically according to models of personality. This allows for precise control over content and style in the training data. Most previous work has lacked such a corpus.

- The paper systematically compares neural architectures that provide different levels of explicit stylistic supervision. It shows benefits to providing an explicit context encoding of stylistic parameters. Other related work has not systematically compared different model architectures in this way. 

- The paper introduces novel automatic evaluation methods tailored to assessing deletions, repetitions and substitutions, providing a more nuanced view of semantic fidelity than typical metrics like BLEU.

- The paper evaluates the modeling of multiple interacting stylistic parameters simultaneously. Much related work has focused on controlling only a single style variable like sentiment or formality.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions through creation of a large parallel corpus, introducing model architectures that allow explicit stylistic control, and performing detailed automatic and human evaluations focused on disentangling content and style. The systematic comparison of models with different stylistic supervision levels is an important addition to the literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Further evaluating the models' ability to generate utterances with multiple interacting stylistic parameters, such as testing combinations of more than two personalities.

- Exploring whether providing even more explicit stylistic supervision to the models, beyond the context vector encoding, could further improve performance.

- Evaluating the models with human judges to get more insight into their stylistic variation capabilities, beyond just automated metrics.

- Testing the models on additional domains beyond just the restaurant domain.

- Incorporating additional stylistic parameters beyond just aggregation and pragmatic markers.

- Comparing against other recent style-control focused models on their semantic fidelity and stylistic control metrics.

- Exploring whether the models can learn additional generalizations about stylistic variation beyond what was seen explicitly during training.

- Developing unsupervised methods of stylistic control that do not require parallel data like the Personage-generated corpus.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around expanding the evaluation of stylistic control, incorporating more stylistic parameters, testing on additional domains, comparing to other recent models, exploring unsupervised methods, and evaluating the models' generalization capabilities. The authors seem optimistic about the potential for neural models to effectively control style while maintaining semantic fidelity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents three different sequence-to-sequence neural network models for generating stylistically varied text while maintaining semantic fidelity. The models are trained on a novel corpus of over 88,000 utterances synthesized by the statistical generator Personage, which varies the style of the utterances according to different personality models. The three models vary in the amount of explicit stylistic supervision provided during training. Model_NoSupervision is a basic seq2seq model with no explicit stylistic information. Model_Token adds a token to encode personality. Model_Context provides the most supervision through an encoding of 36 stylistic parameters that are input at each timestep. Experiments show Model_Context achieves the best balance of semantic fidelity and stylistic variation. The results suggest neural architectures can benefit from explicit stylistic supervision even with a large training corpus.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents three different sequence-to-sequence neural network models for generating natural language that can control stylistic variation based on personality models, while maintaining semantic fidelity. The authors created a large parallel training corpus of over 88,000 utterances in the restaurant domain using the statistical generator Personage to synthesize different stylistic variants based on models of Big Five personality types. The three neural models systematically vary the amount of explicit stylistic information provided - no stylistic encoding, a token encoding personality, and an explicit context vector encoding 36 stylistic parameters. 

The models are evaluated for their ability to produce stylistically varied output corresponding to the personality models, while avoiding common neural generation errors like deletions or repetitions. The model with the most explicit stylistic encoding, Model_Context, performed the best on measures of both semantic fidelity and stylistic variation. It produced the most varied output, with highest correlations to the Personage data for reproducing pragmatic markers and aggregation preferences of each personality. It also had the lowest error rates for deletions, repetitions and substitutions. The results suggest neural architectures can benefit from explicit modeling of stylistic parameters, even with large training datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents three neural network models for controlling personality-based stylistic variation in natural language generation while maintaining semantic fidelity. The models are trained on a large parallel corpus of over 88,000 utterances in the restaurant domain synthesized by the statistical generator Personage. The utterances exhibit stylistic variations based on models of the Big Five personality traits. The three models systematically vary the amount of explicit stylistic supervision provided: Model_NoSupervision is a basic sequence-to-sequence model with no explicit stylistic encoding, Model_Token provides minimal supervision by encoding the personality as a token, and Model_Context provides the most supervision by encoding 36 stylistic parameters as a context vector input to the encoder at each time step. Experiments show Model_Context benefits most from the explicit stylistic supervision, producing outputs that faithfully realize the semantics while exhibiting stylistic variations characteristic of different personalities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of controlling stylistic variation in neural natural language generation while maintaining semantic fidelity. Specifically, it is investigating how different neural network architectures can learn to generate utterances that accurately convey meaning (semantic fidelity) while also exhibiting different styles characterized by models of personality.

The key questions the paper is trying to answer are:

- How can neural NLG models disentangle content and style to generate utterances that are both semantically faithful and stylistically varied?

- What kinds of model architectures and supervision signals allow neural models to best achieve these goals of semantic fidelity and stylistic control? 

- How can the tradeoff between semantic errors and stylistic generalization be characterized for different models?

- Can explicit stylistic parameters help neural models achieve better performance on both semantic and stylistic goals, even with large amounts of training data?

So in summary, the paper is focused on investigating neural architectures for stylistic control in NLG while maintaining semantic fidelity, with a goal of understanding how to best disentangle content and style in neural models. The key questions revolve around what model designs and supervision signals improve performance on both semantic and stylistic goals.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel method for controlling stylistic variation in neural natural language generation while maintaining semantic fidelity. The key ideas are:

- They create a new large parallel corpus of over 88,000 utterances in the restaurant domain with matched inputs and outputs. The inputs are meaning representations and the outputs exhibit variations in style according to models of personality from psychology. 

- The corpus allows them to precisely control the semantic content as well as systematically vary stylistic parameters related to aggregation and pragmatic markers, based on Big Five personality models. This lets them test how well different neural architectures can disentangle content and style.

- They present 3 neural seq2seq architectures with increasing levels of explicit stylistic supervision: no-supervision, model_token, and model_context. Model_context has the most supervision through an encoding of stylistic parameters.

- Model_context performs the best at preserving semantics while capturing stylistic variations. The explicit stylistic supervision helps it achieve high fidelity to both goals, even with a large amount of training data.

- Analysis shows model_context has the highest correlations with the training data in recreating aggregation operations and pragmatic marker usage per personality. It also has the highest entropy while minimizing semantic errors.

- Human evaluation shows model_context generates distinguishable personalities. The models can also combine personalities at test time to create new stylistic blending effects.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that explicit modeling of stylistic parameters enables neural generators to produce varied outputs while accurately conveying meaning representations. The novel corpus and models provide a useful testbed for controllable generation.
