# [What Do They Capture? -- A Structural Analysis of Pre-Trained Language   Models for Source Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There has been significant recent work on developing pre-trained language models for source code, such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. These models have achieved promising results on downstream tasks like code completion and code search. However, there is little understanding of why these models work and what syntactic or semantic features of code they capture during pre-training. Interpreting these models is important for further progress.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper conducts a thorough structural analysis of pre-trained code models from three perspectives:

1. Attention Analysis: Analyze whether self-attention aligns with syntax structure in abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Find attention weights connect tokens in AST motif structures, especially in deeper layers.  

2. Structural Probing: Design probes to test if syntax structure embeds in contextual word vectors. Find evidence of syntax in vector transformations, best in middle layers.

3. Syntax Tree Induction: Test if models can induce syntax trees without training. Find models capture syntax to an extent, clear improvements over baseline approaches.  

Main Contributions:

- Show attention alignments with AST motif structures, differs across layers/heads.
- Demonstrate syntax embeds in contextual word vectors from pre-trained models. 
- Show pre-trained models have some unsupervised syntax tree induction ability.

The analysis provides an interpretation of why pre-trained code models are effective. It suggests incorporating explicit syntax structure into pre-training could further improve representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a thorough structural analysis of pre-trained language models for source code from three perspectives - attention analysis, probing on word embeddings, and syntax tree induction - to interpret what syntactic feature correlations these models capture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Conducting attention analysis to show that the learned attention weights align well with the motif structures in abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of code, especially in the deeper layers. 

2) Proposing a structural probing approach to demonstrate that syntax structure is embedded in the contextual word embeddings learned by pre-trained models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT.

3) Investigating the capability of pre-trained models to induce syntax trees of code without any training. The results show these models can capture syntactic structure to some extent through pre-training on large code corpora.

In summary, the paper provides an in-depth analysis and interpretation of what syntactic and structural information pre-trained models for source code are able to capture. The findings suggest it could be helpful to incorporate syntax structure into the pre-training process for better code representations.

The paper focuses on conducting a structural analysis to interpret what feature correlations are captured by pre-trained language models for source code, such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. The analysis approaches include attention analysis to align attention with syntax structure, structural probing to see if syntax structure is embedded in word vectors, and syntax tree induction to see if models can induce syntax trees without training. Key goals are understanding why these pre-trained models work well and what syntactic properties of code they capture.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three distinct structural analysis approaches - attention analysis, probing analysis, and syntax tree induction. Can you elaborate on the key ideas behind each approach and how they are used to interpret pre-trained code models?

2. Attention analysis reveals that attention aligns with the motif structure in ASTs. What is a "motif structure" and why does this alignment provide evidence that attention captures syntactic properties of code? 

3. The paper finds variability in attention, with some heads focusing on position and others on content. How is attention variability quantified? What does high vs low variability indicate about different attention heads?

4. Explain the key idea behind using structural probing to determine if syntax structure is embedded in the contextual word embeddings of pre-trained models. Why is distance between tokens indicative of syntactic relations?

5. The syntax tree induction approach greedily constructs trees based on distances between token embeddings. What distance functions and biases are introduced? How do these impact the shape and accuracy of induced trees?

6. What baseline tree induction approaches are used for comparison? Why does the right branching baseline perform well and how does this provide insights into the structure of ASTs?

7. What limitations exist in using AST structure as the basis for the analysis approaches in this paper? What other structural aspects of code could be considered in future work?

8. The analysis focuses on CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. How could the analysis approaches be extended to study other types of models for code representation learning?

9. What similarities and differences exist between this analysis of pre-trained code models compared to analysis of models like BERT in NLP research?  

10. What key findings and takeaways from this analysis could positively impact future research on code representation learning and model interpretability?
