# [SWAP-NAS: Sample-Wise Activation Patterns For Ultra-Fast NAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04161)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating neural network performance is critical for neural architecture search (NAS), but full training of each candidate network is computationally prohibitive. 
- Existing fast evaluation methods like training-free metrics have limitations like unreliable correlation with actual performance, poor generalizability across search spaces/tasks, and bias towards larger models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Sample-Wise Activation Patterns (SWAP) and SWAP-Score, a new training-free metric for evaluating network performance.
- SWAP examines activation patterns per input sample instead of aggregated over all samples. This gives a higher upper bound for pattern cardinality, allowing better differentiation of networks.
- SWAP-Score is defined as the cardinality of the SWAP set. It correlates strongly with actual performance across diverse search spaces and tasks.
- A regularization method is added to SWAP-Score to enable control over model size.
- SWAP-Score is integrated with evolutionary search as SWAP-NAS, delivering an ultra-fast and effective NAS algorithm.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of SWAP and SWAP-Score, which outperforms 15 existing training-free metrics on 5 search spaces and 7 tasks in terms of correlation with ground-truth performance.
- Demonstration that regularized SWAP-Score enables control over model size during NAS, and further improves correlation in cell-based search spaces.  
- SWAP-NAS completes architecture search on CIFAR-10 in 0.004 GPU days and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, highlighting efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through the proposal of SWAP and SWAP-Score for fast yet accurate evaluation of network performance, and their integration into an ultra-fast and effective NAS method called SWAP-NAS.
