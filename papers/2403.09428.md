# [Borrowing Treasures from Neighbors: In-Context Learning for Multimodal   Learning with Missing Modalities and Data Scarcity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal machine learning models often suffer from missing modalities, where some samples lack data from certain modalities. This is a common issue in real-world settings like healthcare.
- Missing modalities is even more challenging when combined with limited labeled training data (data scarcity). However, this practical low-data regime with missing modalities has received little attention. 

- Existing methods typically take a parametric approach to handle missing modalities by learning to estimate/reconstruct the missing data. But these rely on having sufficient training data.

- The paper provides an empirical analysis showing that: (1) Performance degrades significantly for existing methods under data scarcity, (2) Whether missing vs full modalities are harder to learn depends on the task complexity. This suggests solely focusing on reconstructing missing modalities may not be optimal.

Method:
- The paper proposes a semi-parametric approach using retrieval-augmented in-context learning to address the joint challenge of missing modalities and data scarcity.

- The key idea is to leverage and fuse features from the most similar samples with full modalities to enhance both missing and full modality samples. This is done via an in-context learning module.

- For samples with missing modalities, this allows implicitly inferring the absent modalities. For full modality samples, it refines features using neighbor information.

- Only the in-context learning module requires training, reducing reliance on large labeled data. The feature extractor network is frozen.

Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates limitations of existing parametric methods under data scarcity, and that dependence on missing vs full modalities varies by task complexity.

- Proposes a novel semi-parametric approach using retrieval and in-context learning to address joint challenge of missing modalities and limited labeled data.

- Achieves average improvement of 6.1% over strong baseline on 4 datasets. Also reduces gap between missing and full modality performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a retrieval-augmented in-context learning method to address the key challenges of missing modalities and data scarcity in multimodal learning by exploiting nearest neighbors of full-modality data to enhance both missing- and full-modality samples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. The paper investigates the data scarcity issue in missing-modality tasks and shows the drawback of existing parametric approaches in the low-data regime, as their effectiveness often relies on having sufficient training data. The paper also reveals through empirical study that models should adaptively focus on both missing- and full-modality data, as dependence on missing-modality data is not necessarily worse. 

2. The paper proposes a novel data-dependent in-context learning method to improve sample efficiency and benefit the learning of both missing- and full-modality data in the low-data regime. The method exploits the value of nearest neighbor information from full-modality training data. To the authors' knowledge, this is among the first works to use in-context learning to address the challenge of missing modality and data scarcity.

3. Through experiments on four datasets, including medical and vision-language tasks, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed in-context learning method. It shows improved performance over the baseline on both full- and missing-modality test data. Notably, it achieves an average gain of 6.1% over the baseline in the low-data regime across the datasets. The method also reduces the performance gap between full- and missing-modality data.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel in-context learning approach to handle the joint challenge of missing modalities and data scarcity in multimodal learning, with demonstrated improvements over existing methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Multimodal learning: The paper focuses on multimodal machine learning, which uses multiple modalities like vision, language, sound, etc. 

- Missing modalities: A key challenge addressed is missing modalities in multimodal learning, where some samples lack data from certain modalities.

- Data scarcity/Low data regime: The paper specifically examines the problem of missing modalities coupled with limited training data. 

- In-context learning (ICL): The proposed method utilizes an in-context learning approach to exploit the value of available full-modality data.

- Retrieval-augmentation: The ICL method retrieves and fuses the features of the most similar full-modality neighbor samples to enhance learning.

- Semi-parametric approach: Unlike common parametric techniques, the proposed ICL framework has limited trainable parameters and emphasizes sample quality over quantity.

- Performance gap: The paper analyzes the performance gap between full and missing modality data across tasks and aims to reduce this gap.

So in summary, the key terms cover multimodal learning, missing modalities, data scarcity, in-context learning, retrieval-augmentation, semi-parametric approaches, and performance gap analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a semi-parametric approach that uses retrieval-augmented in-context learning to address the challenges of missing modalities and data scarcity. How does this approach differ from existing parametric methods, and what are the advantages of using a semi-parametric method in this context?

2) The paper introduces two configurations for the in-context learning module - ICL by cross attention (ICL-CA) and ICL by next-token prediction (ICL-NTP). Can you explain in detail the differences between these two approaches and why ICL-CA demonstrates better performance overall? 

3) When constructing the context for the in-context learning module, the paper only uses the features of full-modality neighbor samples from the training set. What is the rationale behind this design choice? Have the authors experimented with using all training samples or only samples with missing modalities?

4) One of the key findings is that the model should adaptively focus on both missing-modality and full-modality data instead of solely focusing on reconstructing missing modalities. What empirical observations led to this insight?

5) How does the paper analyze the performance gap between full-modality and missing-modality test data? What metrics are used to quantify this gap? Does the proposed method help in reducing this gap?

6) The ablation studies analyze the impact of number of neighbor samples and pooled feature length on the model performance. Can you summarize the key findings and suggestions from these analyses?

7) The paper demonstrates improved sample efficiency with the proposed in-context learning approach, especially in the low data regime. What is the hypothesized reason for this improved sample efficiency?

8) One concern for retrieval-augmented methods is increased inference latency. Does the paper analyze inference time of the proposed method? How does it compare to the baseline?

9) What is the effect of task complexity on relative reliance of the model on full- vs missing- modality data? Does the proposed method exhibit consistent performance gains across tasks of varying complexity?

10) The paper targets multimodal learning scenarios with missing modalities and data scarcity. Can this method be extended to other transfer learning settings lacking such constraints? What adaptations would be required?
