# [Look Before You Leap: Socially Acceptable High-Speed Ground Robot   Navigation in Crowded Hallways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous robots operating in crowded environments like warehouses need to navigate efficiently while ensuring safety and comfort of humans sharing the space. However, existing planners tend to sacrifice robot performance for human comfort, leading to the "robot freezing problem" where robots get stuck unable to make progress.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a motion planning pipeline for ground robots enabling "peek-and-pass" maneuvers to solve the robot freezing problem. The key ideas are:
  - Convert sensor data to costmaps for navigation
  - Predict future human trajectories using a generator model
  - Optimize a tradeoff between robot progress, safety, and human comfort in the cost function
  - Enable robots to peek before passing to ensure safety

Key Contributions:
- Formulates the hallway passing problem for autonomous ground robots as an optimization problem balancing progress, safety and human comfort
- Introduces a "peek-and-pass" maneuver where robots peek before overtaking slow humans, ensuring safety
- Demonstrates improved robot performance in terms of time to goal compared to other planners through detailed simulation experiments
- Shows that the approach does not sacrifice social acceptability metrics like personal space violations and human trajectory interruptions
- Provides hardware demonstrations indicating that the planner enables robots to follow and pass humans in real-world scenarios

In summary, the key insight is that allowing robots to cautiously peek before passing in narrow spaces significantly improves navigation performance without compromising on safety or making humans uncomfortable. This helps address a key limitation of existing socially-aware robot motion planners.
