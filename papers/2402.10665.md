# [Selective Prediction for Semantic Segmentation using Post-Hoc Confidence   Estimation and Its Performance under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic segmentation plays an important role in computer vision but often suffers from lack of high-quality labeled training data. A common approach is to use models trained on publicly available datasets, but this leads to distribution shift between training and deployment data, reducing performance.
- In applications where model errors can have significant consequences, selective prediction methods can help mitigate risks and reduce reliance on expert annotations.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate selective prediction for semantic segmentation in low-resource settings. Focus on post-hoc confidence estimators applied to pre-trained models operating under distribution shift.
- Propose a new image-level confidence measure specifically tailored for semantic segmentation based on the soft Dice loss.

Experiments:
- Evaluate on 3 medical imaging tasks - polyp segmentation, optic cup segmentation, multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation. Use state-of-the-art pre-trained models for each one. 
- Compare several confidence measures: maximum softmax probability (MSP), negative entropy, predicted lesion load, proposed soft Dice confidence (SDC).
- Assess selective prediction ability using risk-coverage curves and coverage at fixed risk metrics.

Results: 
- The proposed SDC confidence measure consistently and significantly outperforms other measures on out-of-distribution test data across all tasks.
- Selective prediction shows promise for tackling distribution shift when other options are limited. With SDC, can process 49-65% of new data with model alone while maintaining in-distribution performance.

Main Contributions:
- First image-level post-hoc confidence measures for semantic segmentation.
- Novel SDC confidence measure designed for segmentation that connects to evaluation metrics. 
- Evaluation on 3 medical tasks showing SDC enables much better selective prediction than alternatives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates selective prediction for semantic segmentation in low-resource settings by evaluating post-hoc confidence estimators applied to pre-trained models operating under distribution shift, proposing a novel image-level confidence measure tailored for semantic segmentation and demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments on three medical imaging tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) This is the first paper to evaluate image-level post-hoc confidence measures for selective prediction in semantic segmentation, extending the existing methods for classification.

2) The paper proposes a novel image-level confidence estimation method designed specifically for image segmentation, which takes into account usual segmentation evaluation metrics. 

3) The paper evaluates all methods in 3 medical imaging tasks (polyp segmentation, optic cup segmentation and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation) under distribution shift, and shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms other confidence estimators.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a new image-level confidence measure for semantic segmentation that works well under distribution shift, outperforming other approaches. The key aspects are that it is designed for segmentation rather than just adapted from classification, and that it is tailored to common segmentation evaluation metrics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel image-level confidence measure called "soft Dice confidence" (SDC) for semantic segmentation. How is SDC formulated and what are the key ideas behind it? How is it related to the soft Dice loss?

2. The paper evaluates SDC and other confidence measures under distribution shift between training and test data. Why is selective prediction useful in this setting? What are the practical low-resource scenarios where this approach would be valuable?  

3. The paper compares SDC to several baseline confidence measures like maximum softmax probability and negative entropy. What are the limitations of using these pixel-level measures for image-level selective prediction? Why might aggregating them perform poorly?

4. The risk-coverage curves demonstrate SDC outperforms other measures, but performance varies across tasks. What factors might explain this variance? How could the method be improved for more consistent performance?  

5. How exactly is the coverage metric calculated in Table 2? What practical insight does this table provide into the potential value of selective prediction under distribution shift? What conclusions can be drawn?

6. The paper focuses on post-hoc confidence estimation applied to pre-trained models. What are the limitations of this approach compared to alternatives like ensembles or training custom models? When would post-hoc estimation be preferred despite the limitations?

7. How do the 3 medical imaging tasks and datasets used in experiments simulate low-resource real-world settings with distribution shift? What practical clinical issues motivate selective prediction research in these domains?  

8. The paper uses area under the risk-coverage curve as its main evaluation metric. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this metric? How else could selective prediction methods be evaluated?

9. For the polyp segmentation task, SDC performs much better on PVT versus U-Net model. Why such big difference? What explanations could there be in terms of model architectures? 

10. The paper focuses on image-level selective prediction for segmentation. How difficult would extending this to video or 3D imaging data be? What new challenges might emerge in those settings?
