# [Selective Prediction for Semantic Segmentation using Post-Hoc Confidence   Estimation and Its Performance under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic segmentation plays an important role in computer vision but often suffers from lack of high-quality labeled training data. A common approach is to use models trained on publicly available datasets, but this leads to distribution shift between training and deployment data, reducing performance.
- In applications where model errors can have significant consequences, selective prediction methods can help mitigate risks and reduce reliance on expert annotations.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate selective prediction for semantic segmentation in low-resource settings. Focus on post-hoc confidence estimators applied to pre-trained models operating under distribution shift.
- Propose a new image-level confidence measure specifically tailored for semantic segmentation based on the soft Dice loss.

Experiments:
- Evaluate on 3 medical imaging tasks - polyp segmentation, optic cup segmentation, multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation. Use state-of-the-art pre-trained models for each one. 
- Compare several confidence measures: maximum softmax probability (MSP), negative entropy, predicted lesion load, proposed soft Dice confidence (SDC).
- Assess selective prediction ability using risk-coverage curves and coverage at fixed risk metrics.

Results: 
- The proposed SDC confidence measure consistently and significantly outperforms other measures on out-of-distribution test data across all tasks.
- Selective prediction shows promise for tackling distribution shift when other options are limited. With SDC, can process 49-65% of new data with model alone while maintaining in-distribution performance.

Main Contributions:
- First image-level post-hoc confidence measures for semantic segmentation.
- Novel SDC confidence measure designed for segmentation that connects to evaluation metrics. 
- Evaluation on 3 medical tasks showing SDC enables much better selective prediction than alternatives.
