# [Multi Task Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Common Sense Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing effective reward functions for reinforcement learning agents operating in complex real-world environments is challenging. Misalignments between rewards and desired behavior can lead to unwanted outcomes like "reward hacking".
- The paper argues for disentangling the reward function into two components: a simple task-specific reward, and an unknown common-sense reward indicating expected reasonable behavior in the environment. 

Proposed Solution:
- Learn the unknown common-sense reward from expert demonstrations using multi-task inverse reinforcement learning (MT-IRL). 
- Show standard IRL fails to learn useful/transferable rewards even when imitation is successful.
- Propose MT-CSIRL method which trains IRL discriminator on trajectories from multiple tasks to learn shared common-sense reward.
- Use curriculum learning to gradually increase impact of learned common-sense reward.

Contributions:
- Conceptualize disentangling task-specific vs common-sense rewards. This allows combining demonstrations from multiple tasks and injecting priors on goals.
- Empirically show importance of multi-task learning for learning transferable common-sense rewards. Learning from variety of tasks avoids learning task-specific behaviors.
- Demonstrate failure modes of standard IRL in terms of learning transferable rewards.
- Propose simple and effective MT-CSIRL algorithm to learn common-sense rewards from multiple task demonstrations.
- Show learned common-sense reward leads to reasonable behavior and transfers to unseen tasks on Meta-World benchmark.

In summary, key ideas are disentangling reward structure and using multi-task learning to learn reusable common-sense rewards from demonstrations that shape agent behavior across tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-task inverse reinforcement learning method to learn a common-sense reward from expert demonstrations across various tasks, demonstrating that training on a variety of tasks is key to obtaining a useful and transferable reward function.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Disentangling the reward function into two distinct components - a simple task-specific reward that defines the goals, and an unknown common-sense reward that indicates the expected behavior within the environment.

2. Proposing a multi-task inverse reinforcement learning (MT-CSIRL) approach to learn this unknown common-sense reward from expert demonstrations across multiple tasks. This allows combining information from different tasks to learn the underlying shared common-sense behaviors.

3. Empirically showing that standard inverse RL fails to learn a useful common-sense reward even when imitation is successful. The key insight is that learning from a variety of tasks is critical for capturing meaningful and transferable rewards.

4. Advocating for more focus in inverse RL on the learned reward itself rather than just using it as an auxiliary construct for imitation. The common-sense reward can guide the agent's behavior in desirable ways across tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is the formulation and learning of the common-sense reward in a multi-task setup to capture transferable behaviors, along with analysis showing limitations of standard inverse RL.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)
- Common-sense reward
- Task-specific reward 
- Reward hacking
- Multi-task inverse reinforcement learning (MT-IRL)
- Meta-world benchmark
- Transfer learning
- Curriculum learning
- Disentangling rewards
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

The main focus of the paper is on using multi-task IRL to learn a "common-sense" reward function separate from the task-specific reward. This common-sense reward aims to encode desired agent behaviors that can transfer across tasks. The key ideas are disentangling the reward function into task-specific and task-agnostic (common-sense) parts, using multi-task learning across diverse tasks to avoid learning spurious correlations, and showing that standard IRL fails to learn properly transferable reward functions. Concepts like reward hacking, curriculum learning, GANs, and the Meta-world benchmark are also featured.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues for disentangling the reward function into a task-specific part and a task-agnostic common-sense part. What are some potential challenges or limitations of making this distinction? For example, is it always clear what should belong to the common-sense vs task-specific rewards?

2. The paper introduces a curriculum learning approach to gradually increase the impact of the learned common-sense reward during training. Why is this helpful? Does it indicate some fundamental challenges in learning a useful common-sense reward?

3. The paper shows that standard IRL fails to learn a useful common-sense reward even when imitation performance is good. What core assumptions of IRL might this highlight as problematic? How could they be addressed? 

4. Multi-task learning seems crucial for learning a useful common-sense reward. However, what are some potential negative transfer issues that could arise with a naive multi-task approach? How does the method introduced in the paper avoid these?

5. The common-sense rewards used in experiments are quite simple (velocity and action norm). What challenges do you foresee in scaling up to more complex common-sense rewards? Would the method still be effective?

6. Could the idea of disentangling task-specific and common-sense rewards be useful even in a non-IRL RL setting? What modifications would have to be made?

7. The method relies on expert demonstrations which can be difficult to obtain in practice. How robust is the approach likely to be to suboptimal demonstrations?

8. What other methods exist for injecting common-sense constraints or behaviors into RL agents? How do they compare to the approach proposed here?

9. What types of theory could we develop around multi-task IRL to provide guarantees on the quality of learned common-sense rewards?

10. How well would this approach transfer to extremely novel test tasks? Could the concept of a task-independent common-sense reward break down if test tasks are too different?
