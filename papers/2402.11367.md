# [Multi Task Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Common Sense Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing effective reward functions for reinforcement learning agents operating in complex real-world environments is challenging. Misalignments between rewards and desired behavior can lead to unwanted outcomes like "reward hacking".
- The paper argues for disentangling the reward function into two components: a simple task-specific reward, and an unknown common-sense reward indicating expected reasonable behavior in the environment. 

Proposed Solution:
- Learn the unknown common-sense reward from expert demonstrations using multi-task inverse reinforcement learning (MT-IRL). 
- Show standard IRL fails to learn useful/transferable rewards even when imitation is successful.
- Propose MT-CSIRL method which trains IRL discriminator on trajectories from multiple tasks to learn shared common-sense reward.
- Use curriculum learning to gradually increase impact of learned common-sense reward.

Contributions:
- Conceptualize disentangling task-specific vs common-sense rewards. This allows combining demonstrations from multiple tasks and injecting priors on goals.
- Empirically show importance of multi-task learning for learning transferable common-sense rewards. Learning from variety of tasks avoids learning task-specific behaviors.
- Demonstrate failure modes of standard IRL in terms of learning transferable rewards.
- Propose simple and effective MT-CSIRL algorithm to learn common-sense rewards from multiple task demonstrations.
- Show learned common-sense reward leads to reasonable behavior and transfers to unseen tasks on Meta-World benchmark.

In summary, key ideas are disentangling reward structure and using multi-task learning to learn reusable common-sense rewards from demonstrations that shape agent behavior across tasks.
