# [TeMO: Towards Text-Driven 3D Stylization for Multi-Object Meshes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04248)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes TeMO, a novel framework for text-driven 3D stylization of multi-object meshes. Existing methods perform poorly on multi-object scenes because CLIP is mainly pre-trained on single objects and uses coarse image-text similarity that loses detail. To address this, TeMO first parses the 3D scene and text to align objects using a Decoupled Graph Attention (DGA) module, which matches noun phrases to surface point clusters. This distinguishes feature reinforcement across objects. Second, a Cross-Grained Contrast (CGC) loss provides both coarse, global image-text similarity and fine-grained similarity between text words and image regions to retain detail. Experiments demonstrate TeMOâ€™s ability to stylize various multi-object scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in semantic alignment to text and generation of realistic, detailed stylizations. The scene parsing perspective could inspire future multi-object editing. Key limitations are lack of symmetry priors and issues adapting diffusion models that also struggle with multi-object text representations. Overall, the proposed TeMO framework significantly advances progress in the challenging space of text-driven 3D stylization for complex multi-object scenes.
