# [Towards Efficient and Effective Text-to-Video Retrieval with   Coarse-to-Fine Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00701)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent text-to-video retrieval methods based on CLIP models have made rapid progress by exploiting richer visual and textual cues for better cross-modal alignment. However, state-of-the-art approaches often design complex fusion blocks for sentence-video interaction, which lead to high computational complexity. This poses challenges in balancing retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called EERCF towards efficient and effective text-to-video retrieval with coarse-to-fine visual representation learning. The key ideas are:

1) Learn multi-granularity visual features, including text-agnostic video-level, text-driven frame-level and patch-level features, to capture both abstract and detailed visual information. This is achieved via a parameter-free Text-Gated Interaction Block (TIB).

2) Optimize feature learning with both inter-feature contrastive loss for cross-modal alignment and intra-feature Pearson constraint for redundancy reduction. 

3) Adopt a two-stage retrieval strategy to utilize the multi-granularity features - use coarse video-level features for fast candidate recall, then re-rank by fine-grained frame and patch features. This balances efficiency and effectiveness.

Main Contributions:

- Propose TIB module to generate multi-granularity adaptive visual features without extra parameters.

- Introduce Pearson constraint to reduce inter-channel redundancy for optimized feature learning.

- Design a two-stage retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine visual features that achieves SOTA performance while being much more efficient.

- Extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and up to 50Ã— speedup over previous methods.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in effectively balancing performance and efficiency for text-to-video retrieval via novel multi-granularity representation learning and a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework, EERCF, for efficient and effective text-to-video retrieval that learns coarse-grained and fine-grained visual representations and utilizes them in a two-stage recall-then-rerank retrieval pipeline to balance performance and efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A text-gated interaction block without extra learning parameters for multi-grained adaptive representation learning, along with a combination of inter-feature contrastive loss and intra-feature Pearson Constraint for optimizing feature learning.

2) A two-stage text-to-video retrieval strategy that strikes an optimal balance between effectiveness and efficiency, facilitating practical implementation.  

3) The proposed method EERCF achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets while having significantly lower computation cost (14-126 times less FLOPs).

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and effective framework for text-to-video retrieval, which learns coarse-to-fine visual representations to enable a two-stage retrieval process balancing performance and speed. The method matches or exceeds prior state-of-the-art with much lower computational complexity.
