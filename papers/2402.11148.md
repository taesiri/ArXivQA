## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective technique to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. A key component of KD is temperature scaling, which is applied to soften both the teacher and student probability distributions. However, the role of temperature scaling is not well understood. Specifically, it is unclear (1) why temperature scaling needs to be applied to both teacher and student, and (2) if it would be better to apply scaling only to the teacher. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a variant of KD called "transformed teacher matching" (TTM) where temperature scaling is only applied to the teacher. By interpreting temperature scaling as a power transform of the probability distribution, the paper shows theoretically that TTM introduces an extra Rényi entropy regularization term compared to standard KD. This acts similarly to confidence penalty regularization and leads to better generalization. To further improve student capability to match the teacher, a sample-adaptive weighted version called WTTM is introduced.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates both theoretically and empirically that removing temperature scaling from the student leads to better performance compared to standard KD
- Provides a theoretical understanding of TTM - it inherently has a Rényi entropy regularizer that improves generalization compared to KD 
- Proposes a novel sample-adaptive weighted TTM method (WTTM) that further improves student capability to match the transformed teacher
- Achieves state-of-the-art distillation performance on CIFAR and ImageNet with the proposed WTTM, outperforming existing complex feature-based distillation methods

In summary, this paper systematically studies the role of temperature scaling in KD, and shows that applying scaling only to the teacher as done in TTM and WTTM leads to significant improvements over standard KD. The proposed WTTM method also achieves new state-of-the-art performance.
