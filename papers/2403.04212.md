# [Persona Extraction Through Semantic Similarity for Emotional Support   Conversation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating emotionally supportive responses through dialogue systems is important for providing mental health support. Previous works have shown that incorporating user persona, which includes preferences, personality, etc, is effective for empathetic response generation. However, most methods rely on pre-provided personas, which may not be available before the start of a conversation. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes PESS (Persona Extraction through Semantic Similarity), a framework to automatically infer informative and consistent persona from dialogues. 

Key Ideas:
1) Compare ground-truth and generated personas at a sentence level using semantic similarity scores to identify missing and inconsistent sentences
2) Propose Completeness Loss to encourage generating missing persona sentences 
3) Propose Consistency Loss to distinguish consistent vs inconsistent sentences using contrastive learning

Main Contributions:  
1) A persona extraction framework PESS that can generate informative and consistent personas using novel Completeness and Consistency losses 
2) Experiments show PESS generates high-quality personas, which significantly improves emotional support response generation (outperforms previous SOTA methods on both automatic and human evaluations)

In summary, this paper addresses the challenge of automatically inferring persona when not explicitly provided, by designing appropriate objectives based on semantic similarity comparisons. The high-quality personas extracted by the proposed PESS framework lead to improved empathetic dialogue response generation.
