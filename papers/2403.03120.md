# [Motion-Corrected Moving Average: Including Post-Hoc Temporal Information   for Improved Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03120)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video segmentation models that include temporal context have high computational complexity and often require fully labeled training sequences. This poses challenges for real-time applications and medical imaging where labeling video data is difficult.
- Simple averaging between current and past frames helps reduce noise but overemphasizes past frames leading to misalignment.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Motion-Corrected Moving Average (MCMA) to refine exponential moving average between current and previous video frames using optical flow.
- Split segmentation model into feature encoder and decoder. Warp prior encoded features using estimated optical flow to align with current frame's geometry before averaging.
- Keep computations in feature space to enable temporal information without alterations to model architecture or training procedure.

Contributions:
- MCMA improves video segmentation performance by including temporal information without needing specialized training or datasets.
- Alignment using optical flow prevents ghosting artifacts caused by overemphasizing past predictions in moving average.
- Optical flow estimation runs in parallel, adding minimal computational overhead. Enables real-time performance.
- Demonstrated improvements in video segmentation accuracy over baseline and plain averaging on two public datasets (EndoVis, Cityscapes) and two medical video datasets (Barrett, Cholec) spanning different levels of motion.
- Reduces false positive predictions in Barrett's classification while improving segmentation accuracy.

In summary, the paper proposes a lightweight yet effective strategy to leverage temporal information in video segmentation models without architectural constraints. By warping prior predictions, it prevents misalignment artifacts. The modular design and parallelized implementation enable real-time applications.
