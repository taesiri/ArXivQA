# [Gradients are Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05803)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How do gradient-based optimization methods perform when applied to chaotic dynamical systems, and what techniques can be used to overcome potential issues that arise?

The key points related to this question appear to be:

- Chaotic dynamical systems, where small changes in initial conditions lead to diverging trajectories, can pose challenges for gradient-based optimization methods like backpropagation. The gradients can "explode" or become unusable.

- This exploding gradient problem arises from the Jacobian matrices that appear when differentiating through long dynamical system trajectories. Eigenvalues greater than 1 in these Jacobian products lead to exponential divergence.

- The authors demonstrate this exploding gradient phenomenon concretely in various domains like rigid-body physics simulators, recurrent neural networks, and learned optimization.

- Potential solutions discussed include modifying the dynamical systems, using truncated backpropagation, gradient clipping, black-box gradient estimates, and exploiting ergodicity. Each has tradeoffs.

- Overall, the key takeaway seems to be that blindly applying gradient-based methods to chaotic systems can fail catastrophically, and more care needs to be taken, either by changing the system or using more robust optimization techniques.

In summary, the core question is understanding and overcoming challenges of combining gradient-based optimization with chaotic dynamics across different domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper seems to be:

- Highlighting the problem of chaotic dynamics and exploding/vanishing gradients when optimizing differentiable systems like recurrent neural networks, physics simulations, meta-learning, etc. 

- Tracing the source of exploding/vanishing gradients to the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix of the system. Systems with maximum eigenvalues > 1 tend to diverge and have exploding gradients.

- Providing an overview of various techniques used to address this issue, like using learned models instead of the full simulation, changing the system dynamics (e.g. RNN architecture), truncated backpropagation, gradient clipping, etc.

- Making the case that in some chaotic systems, black box gradient estimates like evolutionary strategies may have better properties than backpropagated gradients. The reparameterized gradients can have very high variance due to propagating through the unstable dynamics.

- Empirically demonstrating the exploding gradient problem on tasks like robotics control, meta-learning, and molecular simulations.

In summary, the key insight is that gradients through chaotic systems can explode or vanish due to the recurrent Jacobian, and it provides both analysis and various mitigation techniques. The paper argues we should not always rely on backpropagated gradients when optimizing dynamical systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is my assessment of how it compares to other research in the field of differentiable programming and chaotic dynamics:

- The paper provides a broad overview of chaos as a failure mode when differentiating through dynamical systems. This connects and synthesizes findings from various fields where this issue has been encountered before, including climate modeling, rigid body physics, RNNs, meta-learning, etc. Making these connections is a useful contribution.

- The analysis connecting exploding/vanishing gradients to the spectral properties of the Jacobian aligns with prior findings in domains like RNN training. Formalizing and clearly explaining this relationship is valuable.

- The examples demonstrating chaotic loss landscapes and exploding gradient variance across physics sims, meta-learning, and molecular dynamics help concretely illustrate the issues. However, many prior works have shown related examples.

- The discussion of mitigation strategies is fairly high-level. Many techniques mentioned like gradient clipping, black box gradients, modifying objectives, etc. have been explored in depth in prior works. The overview is helpful but doesn't substantially advance the SoTA.

- Empirical validation is limited. The paper would be strengthened by more systematic experiments quantifying the prevalence of exploding gradients across problem domains and the effectiveness of different mitigation techniques.

In summary, the paper does a good job synthesizing and explaining the issue of differentiating through chaos across a variety of fields. However, most of the core ideas have been shown previously in a more domain-specific manner. The main value is in making explicit connections between findings from different communities. More rigorous empirical characterization would strengthen the paper. Overall, it serves more as a useful conceptual overview rather than a significant research advance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to control or avoid the chaotic dynamics that can lead to exploding/vanishing gradients. For example, designing neural network architectures or physics simulations that are inherently more stable and less prone to chaos.

- Better understanding the relationship between chaos, gradients, and optimization landscape geometry. The authors suggest further exploration into how chaos manifests in the loss landscape and affects the ability to optimize.

- Using alternative gradient estimation methods like black-box optimization or Monte Carlo methods that are more robust to chaos. The authors recommend resorting to these methods when faced with chaotic systems where naive gradients fail.

- Adapting techniques like least squares shadowing, inverting the shadow operator, and probabilistic methods to discrete simulations and machine learning systems. These methods were developed for continuous systems like climate modeling, and adapting them could provide more stable gradients.

- Developing better proxy objectives and physics-based inductive biases that allow optimizing chaotic systems through more well-behaved loss surfaces. The authors suggest leveraging domain knowledge to construct better-conditioned objectives.

- Further analysis and modifications of recurrent neural network architectures to control exploding/vanishing gradients and allow modeling of more complex dynamics.

- Combining black-box and backpropagation-based gradients to get lower variance gradient estimates. The authors suggest hybrid approaches could be beneficial.

- General investigation into the challenges of differentiating through chaotic and multiscale systems across different fields like machine learning, control, and physics simulation.

In summary, the authors recommend better understanding and controlling chaos, using more robust gradient estimators, incorporating problem-specific structure, and drawing ideas across disciplines to address the issues faced when differentiating iterative chaotic systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper discusses how differentiable programming techniques like automatic differentiation and backpropagation through time, while powerful, can fail when used on chaotic systems. The gradients computed through such systems can explode or vanish, making optimization difficult. The authors trace this issue to the spectrum of the Jacobian matrices that arise when differentiating through the dynamics. They provide examples of exploding gradients in domains like recurrent neural networks, rigid body physics simulation, meta-learning, and molecular dynamics. The paper then discusses ways to address these exploding gradients, like using black box optimization methods, changing the system dynamics, or modifying the loss function. Overall, the paper argues that blindly applying gradients to dynamical systems can fail, and that care needs to be taken when optimizing chaotic processes like recurrent networks, physics engines, and complex simulators.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main point of the paper:

The paper argues that while automatic differentiation techniques are powerful, they can fail when differentiating through chaotic or unstable dynamical systems, as small changes in initial conditions can cause trajectories to diverge exponentially.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper discusses the problem of chaotic dynamics causing issues when computing gradients through iterative systems. Differentiable programming techniques are powerful but have limits when the underlying system exhibits chaos. The paper traces this failure to the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix of the system, where eigenvalues greater than 1 lead to exploding gradients. A variety of examples are explored where this occurs, including recurrent neural networks, physics simulation, meta-learning, and molecular dynamics. 

The paper then discusses potential solutions to handle chaotic systems when using gradients. These include modifying the system to be more stable, using truncated backpropagation, gradient clipping, shadowing methods, probabilistic approaches, learned models, and black box gradient estimates. The main message is that just because a system is differentiable does not mean gradients will be effective for optimization. Black box gradient estimates can sometimes provide better results than true gradients when chaos is present. Overall, an awareness of when chaotic dynamics can spoil gradient-based optimization is key.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to compute gradients through chaotic dynamical systems, where small perturbations to the initial conditions or parameters can lead to diverging behavior over time. The key insight is that the gradients depend on the product of Jacobians over time, as shown in Eq. (2). If the eigenvalues of these Jacobian matrices are greater than 1, the gradients can explode exponentially. To address this, the authors suggest several modifications to make the system more stable, such as changing the architecture or initialization of recurrent neural networks, using contact softening or mini-optimizations for physics simulations, and truncating backpropagation through time. They also discuss using black box methods like evolutionary strategies to estimate gradients, as well as techniques leveraging ergodicity like least squares shadowing. Overall, the main message is that naively computing gradients through chaotic systems can be problematic, and modifications to the system, gradient estimation, or optimization process itself may be necessary.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the issue of chaotic dynamics and exploding/vanishing gradients when trying to optimize systems by differentiating through them. Some key points:

- Many modern machine learning techniques involve differentiating through iterative/recurrent processes like neural network training, reinforcement learning, physics simulation, etc. 

- The gradients through these iterative processes depend on products of the Jacobians over time. If the dynamics are chaotic and sensitive, these products can explode or vanish.

- This can cause problems when trying to optimize parameters of the system using gradients. The gradients may be numerically unstable or fail to convey useful information.

- The paper demonstrates this issue arising in various domains like rigid body physics, meta-learning, and molecular simulation.

- It relates the gradient explosions to the presence of eigenvalues greater than 1 in the Jacobians of the system dynamics.

- The paper discusses various ways to address this problem, like modifying the system dynamics, using proxy objectives, truncating gradients, gradient clipping, etc. But notes these come with tradeoffs.

- It also suggests using black box gradient estimates as a simpler alternative in some cases, as they can have better numerical properties than backpropagated gradients.

So in summary, the key focus is on the unintuitive failures of gradient-based optimization through chaotic iterative systems, analyzing the cause, and reviewing potential solutions or workarounds.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper discusses chaos and instabilities that can emerge when computing gradients through iterative dynamical systems, such as recurrent neural networks, physics simulators, and optimization processes. The gradients of loss functions for these systems intrinsically depend on products of Jacobians of the dynamics. When the eigenvalues of these Jacobians are greater than 1, the dynamics can become chaotic, causing the gradients to explode exponentially. This makes optimization difficult. The authors demonstrate this phenomenon across domains like rigid-body physics, meta-learning, and molecular dynamics. They trace the exploding gradients directly to eigenvalues of system Jacobians by analyzing the Ant environment experiments. Potential solutions discussed include modifying the system itself to have better conditioned dynamics, using black box gradient estimates, truncating gradients, and clipping gradients. However, all these introduce bias and the authors recommend trying black box methods first as they can estimate the true gradient with lower variance. Overall, the key insight is that just because a system is differentiable does not mean gradients will be useful for optimization. Care must be taken with chaotic and unstable dynamics.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper discusses how differentiable programming techniques, while powerful, have limitations when used with iterative dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. The gradients of loss functions for such systems depend on products of Jacobians that can grow exponentially if eigenvalues are greater than 1, leading to exploding gradients.
