# [Improving Speaker Assignment in Speaker-Attributed ASR for Real Meeting   Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Past work on end-to-end models for meeting transcription has focused more on model architecture and less on application to real-world data. 
- When applying these models to real recorded meetings, issues arise due to long audio lengths requiring segmentation, and the need to obtain speaker embeddings for speaker assignment. 
- Little prior work has studied optimizing the integration of Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Speaker Diarization (SD) and Speaker-Attributed ASR (SA-ASR) into a pipeline tailored for real applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a complete pipeline with VAD, SD and SA-ASR modules for meeting transcription.
- Advocate fine-tuning the SA-ASR model on VAD segments instead of ground-truth or fixed segments to match test conditions. 
- Explore strategies to enhance speaker assignment in SA-ASR using embeddings from SD instead of human annotations.
- Vary number and lengths of segments used to obtain speaker embeddings and study impact on speaker error rate.

Key Contributions:
- Fine-tuning on VAD segments reduces speaker error rate (SER) by up to 28% relative compared to other segmentation methods.
- Extracting speaker embeddings from SD instead of human annotations further reduces SER by up to 20% relative by improving embedding accuracy.   
- Number and lengths of segments impacts robustness of speaker embeddings. More and longer segments yield better speaker representation and lower SER.
- Improved speaker embeddings do not reduce word error rate, suggesting the feedback mechanism between Speaker Decoder and ASR Decoder needs enhancement.

In summary, the key novelty is showing how to optimally integrate VAD, SD and SA-ASR into a pipeline for meeting transcription, and demonstrating techniques to significantly enhance speaker assignment within the SA-ASR module.
