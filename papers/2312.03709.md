# [UID as a Guiding Metric for Automated Authorship Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores using Uniform Information Density (UID) metrics as a way to guide automated authorship obfuscation. Authorship obfuscation involves taking a text and perturbing it so that automated authorship attribution systems are unable to correctly identify the original author. 

The main research question investigated is whether UID can be an effective metric to use in authorship obfuscation to successfully cause misattribution by authorship classifiers. UID refers to the theory that humans distribute information evenly in speech and text to maximize efficiency. 

The paper proposed three obfuscation algorithms that utilize UID metrics - Synonym Swap, UID Word Swap (UWS), and UID Paraphrase (UP). Synonym Swap randomly swaps words with synonyms. UWS uses BERT to select target words and probable replacements. UP paraphrases sentences using diverse beam search. 

Experiments were run on 100 articles from the TuringBench dataset, with 50 human-authored and 50 GPT-3-generated articles. Obfuscated versions were created with the algorithms and labeled by two authorship classifiers - ZeroGPT and DetectGPT.

The results showed high semantic similarity between originals and obfuscated articles indicating good preservation of meaning. However, there was no clear evidence that utilizing UID metrics resulted in improved obfuscation performance. 

Limitations are discussed including small dataset size, lack of tuned classifiers, and potential need to incorporate UID more directly into the obfuscation process. Future work is proposed to address these limitations and further analyze if UID can play a role in authorship obfuscation.
