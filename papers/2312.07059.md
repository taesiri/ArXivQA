## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Long Short-Term Memory Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN) for estimating the number and gender of simultaneous speakers in noisy environments. A dataset of 19,000 5-second audio samples with varying combinations of male and female voices and background noises was created. Features were extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and fed into a network with CNN layers to extract spatial attributes and bidirectional LSTM layers to extract temporal attributes. The model outputs estimates for the number of male and female speakers, with the sum determining the total speaker count. Comprehensive parameter tuning was conducted, finding 7 CNN channels of 5x5 kernels with 256 filters, 3 BI-LSTM layers of 128 units, and a fully-connected network to work best. The model attained low mean squared error rates around 0.017-0.019 for speaker count and gender estimation. The integration of CNN and BI-LSTM enabled robust learning of spatial and temporal audio attributes, overcoming limitations of architectures relying solely on either. By effectively learning gender and number from complex overlapping audio, this system could enable valuable real-world applications in people counting.
