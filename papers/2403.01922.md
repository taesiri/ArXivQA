# [FlowPrecision: Advancing FPGA-Based Real-Time Fluid Flow Estimation with   Linear Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01922)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate real-time fluid flow measurement is critical for industrial and environmental monitoring applications, but remains challenging. Direct contact sensors degrade quickly in harsh environments while non-contact sensors lack precision or are expensive. Soft sensors utilizing data from cheap sensors to estimate flow rate are a promising solution but typically rely on cloud processing, creating timing and network issues. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper applies linear quantization to neural network-based soft sensor models targeting FPGA deployment for efficient local processing. Linear quantization adapts model parameters to actual data distributions, overcoming limitations of fixed-point quantization and enhancing precision. Optimized integer-only inference accelerates execution while an FPGA hardware accelerator balances improvements to model accuracy and speed with resource utilization and power efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- Applies linear quantization to MLP models, reducing test MSE by up to 10.1% over fixed-point quantization
- Validates approach over multiple datasets, showing consistent gains and improved stability 
- Develops optimized inference techniques and FPGA accelerator enhancing model precision and speed while managing higher resource usage and power draw  
- Achieves up to 9.39% faster inference with optimized hardware implementation, offering efficient local processing alternative to cloud-reliant soft sensors

Overall, the paper demonstrates linear quantization and specialized FPGA acceleration can enable precise, efficient real-time flow estimation for autonomous monitoring systems, overcoming limitations of fixed-point quantization and cloud dependencies. The localized soft sensor offers a viable deployment solution for harsh, remote settings.
