# [Shallow ReLU neural networks and finite elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05809)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper discusses establishing a precise connection between shallow neural networks with ReLU activation and finite element functions such as constant, linear, and tensor finite elements.
- Prior works have shown that any continuous piecewise linear function can be represented by a deep ReLU neural network. However, the number of layers and neurons required for such strict representations are not clearly given. 
- For finite element functions which are exactly piecewise linear, a more accurate characterization of the representation power of shallow neural networks is desired.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the concept of "weak representation" of a function space, which is equivalent to strict representation in Lp norm.
- It is proved that continuous/discontinuous piecewise linear functions on a convex polytope mesh can be weakly represented by a two hidden layer ReLU neural network.
- The numbers of neurons required for the two hidden layers are precisely given based on properties of the mesh, specifically the numbers of polytopes and hyperplanes.
- For tensor finite element functions, strict representation via tensor neural networks is shown, where the size can be determined by the tensor rank.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes connection between shallow ReLU networks and finite element functions through the concept of weak representation.
- Provides theoretical foundation on the approximation capability of shallow networks for representing piecewise linear functions. 
- The size of the representing network can be explicitly computed based on properties of the mesh.
- Bridging neural networks and finite elements could allow mutual benefits in analysis and applications.
- Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate computing the network size for specific meshes and finite element functions.

In summary, the paper links shallow neural networks with finite element methods, enabling new perspectives for understanding and analyzing both areas. The representation results enrich the theoretical properties of shallow networks and finite elements.
