## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spatial-temporal graph (STG) data like traffic networks, metro systems, and weather data are complex with dynamic, heterogeneous, and non-stationary characteristics. This poses challenges for effectively modeling and forecasting the evolution of STG systems over time.  
- Existing methods using graph neural networks (GNNs) or Transformers have limitations in capturing long-term dependencies or have high computational complexity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new model called STG-Mamba that adapts selective state space models (SSSMs) for STG forecasting tasks. 
- It treats the STG data as an evolving system and leverages SSSMs to model the dynamic state transitions.
- The model has an encoder-decoder structure with stacked Graph Selective State Space Blocks (GS3Bs) as basic modules.
- A Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Network (KFGN) is proposed to enable adaptive graph structure upgrading consistent with the system state evolution.
- The GS3B incorporates a selection mechanism to distinguish and retain information relevant for forecasting.

Main Contributions:
- First work to adapt SSSMs for modeling STG system evolution, providing an alternative to Transformer models.
- Proposes custom components GS3B and KFGN tailored for integration of dynamic graph data into SSSMs.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 STG forecasting tasks while also significantly improving computational efficiency.  
- Reduces complexity from quadratic for Transformers to linear for sequence length, cutting down FLOPs and inference times.
- Provides promising new direction for efficient yet accurate STG modeling.

In summary, the paper pioneers selective state space models for spatial-temporal graph forecasting with custom innovations for graph dynamics modeling. It convincingly demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiencies over existing methods on real-world traffic, metro and weather datasets.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba), the first deep learning-based selective state space model (SSSM) for effective data-centric spatial-temporal graph (STG) learning. 

2. It introduces a novel Graph Selective State Space Block (GS3B) as the basic module in STG-Mamba to integrate STG networks with SSSMs, capable of capturing sophisticated heterogenous dependencies in STG and modeling the dynamic evolution of STG systems.

3. It proposes Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) to enable adaptive graph structure upgrading that smoothly fits within the SSSM-based modeling process.

4. Extensive experiments on three benchmark STG datasets demonstrate that STG-Mamba not only exceeds state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, but also reduces computational overhead substantially with its linear time complexity, compared to the quadratic complexity of Transformer-based approaches.
