# [Semi-supervised Active Learning for Video Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07169)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a semi-supervised active learning framework for efficient video action detection. The approach utilizes both labeled and unlabeled video data, overcoming limitations of active learning's cold start problem and semi-supervised learning's need for informative samples. A novel data augmentation strategy called NoiseAug is introduced for sample selection in active learning. It applies varying noise to estimate model uncertainty for ranking sample usefulness. For semi-supervised learning, an fft-attention technique leverages frequency analysis to emphasize relevant activity regions, improving pseudo-label quality. Together, active learning selects informative samples for annotation, while semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training. Evaluated on UCF101-24, JHMDB-21 for action detection and YouTube-VOS for video object segmentation, the proposed unified approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. It demonstrates effectiveness for spatio-temporal understanding tasks using limited supervision, with strong generalization capability to related video domains. The simplicity of the data-driven sample selection and region emphasis enables wider applicability.
