Problem: 
Traditional artificial neural networks struggle with analyzing complex, non-stationary time series data due to high computational complexity, limited ability to capture temporal information, and difficulty handling event-driven data patterns. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Multi-modal Time Series Analysis Model based on Spiking Neural Networks (MTSA-SNN) to address these challenges. The key components of MTSA-SNN are:

2. Joint Learning Module: Employs a joint learning function and weight allocation mechanism to fuse information from multi-modal pulse signals in a shared representation space.

3. Output Layer: Generates predictions or classifications for downstream tasks based on the fused multi-modal spike information.  

4. Wavelet Transform: Decomposes input signals into multi-scale subbands to enhance analysis of non-stationary data.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel spiking neural network model MTSA-SNN for effective multi-modal time series analysis.

- Designs pulse encoding schemes to unify multi-modal temporal data. 

- Introduces spike-based joint learning functions and weight allocation to integrate cross-modal signals.

- Incorporates wavelet transform for multi-scale representation learning.
