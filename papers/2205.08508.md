# [A CLIP-Hitchhiker's Guide to Long Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08508)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively adapt image-text models like CLIP to long video retrieval tasks?The key points are:- Recent works have shown promising results by using CLIP for video retrieval, essentially "hitchhiking" on the image-text representation learned by CLIP. However, simply mean pooling CLIP embeddings per frame performs comparably or better than more complex temporal aggregation methods tried. - For long videos, mean pooling is suboptimal as it weights all frames equally rather than focusing on the most relevant parts. - This paper proposes a simple weighted mean approach to aggregate CLIP embeddings based on query-relevance scoring. This outperforms prior complex aggregation methods and sets a new state-of-the-art on long video retrieval benchmarks.- They provide analysis into why this simple weighted mean works so well, including the effect of dataset scale, and improvements to single-frame representations.In summary, the main hypothesis is that a simple weighted mean aggregation of CLIP embeddings based on query-scoring can outperform more complex temporal modeling attempts for long video retrieval. The experiments validate this hypothesis across several datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective baseline method for adapting image-text models like CLIP to long video retrieval tasks. The key points are:- They show that a weighted average of CLIP image embeddings, where the weights are based on query-scoring, outperforms more complex temporal aggregation methods like transformers. This simple method achieves state-of-the-art on several long video retrieval benchmarks.- They demonstrate the effectiveness of constraining the temporal aggregation to only linearly weight the original image embeddings, rather than learning entirely new representations.- They provide analysis and insights into why this simple weighted average method works well, including: not enough training data for complex temporal modeling, weighted average embeddings capture distinct information, and scoring helps learn better image representations. - Overall, they provide a strong simple baseline for long video retrieval using CLIP, outperforming prior works, and suggest that complex temporal modeling may not be better than basic weighted averaging given current data constraints. The weighted average method also acts as an improved baseline for future methods to compare against.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes using simple query-scoring to weight the relevance of individual frames when aggregating CLIP image embeddings for long video retrieval and classification, finding this outperforms more complex temporal modeling approaches and sets a new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points regarding how this paper compares to other research in long-form video understanding:- It focuses on adapting image-text models like CLIP to long video retrieval/classification tasks. Many recent works have explored using CLIP for video but with limited success in temporal modeling. This paper shows that a simple weighted mean of frame embeddings can outperform more complex temporal aggregation methods.- It provides state-of-the-art results on several long video retrieval benchmarks including MSR-VTT, ActivityNet Captions, and Condensed Movies. The weighted mean aggregation approach using query scoring achieves higher performance than prior work using CLIP.- The paper investigates different scoring methods to predict frame relevance for weighting, including query-dependent and independent approaches. It finds that query scoring works best on average but temporal self-attention can sometimes be comparable.- It offers analysis into why weighted mean frame embeddings are so effective compared to learned aggregation. Main reasons are insufficient training data, mean embeddings capturing distinct information, and improvements to single-frame representations.- The focus is on long-form videos which require aggregating information over minutes or more. This sets it apart from works focused on short video understanding. The weighted mean is more impactful for long videos with high variation between frames.Overall, this paper pushes state-of-the-art in long video retrieval by showing that current complex temporal modeling approaches struggle to beat a simple weighted mean of CLIP embeddings. The strong results and analysis help establish an improved baseline for the field.
