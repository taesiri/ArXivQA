# [A CLIP-Hitchhiker's Guide to Long Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08508)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively adapt image-text models like CLIP to long video retrieval tasks?The key points are:- Recent works have shown promising results by using CLIP for video retrieval, essentially "hitchhiking" on the image-text representation learned by CLIP. However, simply mean pooling CLIP embeddings per frame performs comparably or better than more complex temporal aggregation methods tried. - For long videos, mean pooling is suboptimal as it weights all frames equally rather than focusing on the most relevant parts. - This paper proposes a simple weighted mean approach to aggregate CLIP embeddings based on query-relevance scoring. This outperforms prior complex aggregation methods and sets a new state-of-the-art on long video retrieval benchmarks.- They provide analysis into why this simple weighted mean works so well, including the effect of dataset scale, and improvements to single-frame representations.In summary, the main hypothesis is that a simple weighted mean aggregation of CLIP embeddings based on query-scoring can outperform more complex temporal modeling attempts for long video retrieval. The experiments validate this hypothesis across several datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective baseline method for adapting image-text models like CLIP to long video retrieval tasks. The key points are:- They show that a weighted average of CLIP image embeddings, where the weights are based on query-scoring, outperforms more complex temporal aggregation methods like transformers. This simple method achieves state-of-the-art on several long video retrieval benchmarks.- They demonstrate the effectiveness of constraining the temporal aggregation to only linearly weight the original image embeddings, rather than learning entirely new representations.- They provide analysis and insights into why this simple weighted average method works well, including: not enough training data for complex temporal modeling, weighted average embeddings capture distinct information, and scoring helps learn better image representations. - Overall, they provide a strong simple baseline for long video retrieval using CLIP, outperforming prior works, and suggest that complex temporal modeling may not be better than basic weighted averaging given current data constraints. The weighted average method also acts as an improved baseline for future methods to compare against.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points regarding how this paper compares to other research in long-form video understanding:- It focuses on adapting image-text models like CLIP to long video retrieval/classification tasks. Many recent works have explored using CLIP for video but with limited success in temporal modeling. This paper shows that a simple weighted mean of frame embeddings can outperform more complex temporal aggregation methods.- It provides state-of-the-art results on several long video retrieval benchmarks including MSR-VTT, ActivityNet Captions, and Condensed Movies.

It finds that query scoring works best on average but temporal self-attention can sometimes be comparable.- It offers analysis into why weighted mean frame embeddings are so effective compared to learned aggregation. Main reasons are insufficient training data, mean embeddings capturing distinct information, and improvements to single-frame representations.- The focus is on long-form videos which require aggregating information over minutes or more. This sets it apart from works focused on short video understanding. The weighted mean is more impactful for long videos with high variation between frames.Overall, this paper pushes state-of-the-art in long video retrieval by showing that current complex temporal modeling approaches struggle to beat a simple weighted mean of CLIP embeddings. The strong results and analysis help establish an improved baseline for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Obtaining more large-scale video-text data for pretraining. The authors note that the lack of sufficient pretraining data is a key limitation in developing effective long-form video representations. They suggest future work could focus on obtaining more paired video-text data at scale to facilitate pretraining. - Incorporating self-supervised learning. The authors propose combining self-supervised objectives with the scarcer textual supervision during pretraining, to further improve video representations.- Investigating different temporal aggregation methods. While weighted mean pooling works well, the authors note more complex temporal modeling could potentially outperform this simple approach given enough training data. Exploring alternatives like attention models or recurrent networks is suggested.- Multi-task learning objectives. The authors suggest incorporating additional tasks like action localization during pretraining may improve learning long-form video representations. - Testing on broader range of datasets. Evaluating on more diverse and challenging long-form video datasets is proposed to better test long-form video understanding.In summary, the key future directions highlighted are obtaining more pretraining data, combining self-supervision, exploring better temporal aggregation models, multi-task learning, and evaluation on more diverse datasets. The overarching theme is developing methods to learn more powerful spatiotemporal representations for long-form videos.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes using weighted mean pooling of per-frame CLIP embeddings as a strong baseline for long video retrieval and understanding. Rather than developing complex temporal aggregation networks on top of CLIP, the authors show that simply weighting the relevance of each frame embedding and taking the weighted mean can outperform prior work. They compare three methods to obtain relevance scores for each frame: 1) query scoring using the similarity of each frame embedding to the text query, 2) self-attention on just the frame embeddings, and 3) joint attention using the query embedding and frame embeddings. Experiments across MSR-VTT, ActivityNet, and Condensed Movies datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of this simple weighted mean aggregation baseline over prior works using temporal transformers and squeeze-and-excitation networks. The simplicity and strong performance suggests current temporal modeling attempts are still limited by lack of large-scale pretraining data. The weighted mean also provides an improved baseline for future video-language research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes using simple query scoring to weight frame embeddings for improved video retrieval and classification with vision-language models like CLIP. Recent works have tried to adapt CLIP to videos by proposing complex temporal aggregation methods, but the authors find these perform comparably or worse than just mean pooling the frame embeddings. They show that a weighted mean of frame embeddings guided by query similarity scores significantly outperforms prior temporal aggregation attempts across multiple long-form video datasets. The weighted mean puts more emphasis on relevant frames while downweighting irrelevant ones. They experiment with different scoring methods including query scoring, self-attention, and joint attention. The simple query scoring method works best, with no learned parameters. The results demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of weighting frame embeddings for temporal aggregation, providing a new state of the art baseline for long video retrieval and classification using pretrained vision-language models.In summary, the key contributions are: (1) proposing weighted mean aggregation of CLIP frame embeddings guided by query scoring for improved long video retrieval, (2) achieving new state of the art results across multiple datasets, outperforming prior complex temporal aggregation attempts, (3) analysis providing insights into why this simple method works so effectively, including benefiting single frame representations during training. The weighted mean aggregation provides a strong yet simple baseline for long video tasks using pretrained visual-text models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in this paper is a simple yet effective technique for aggregating frame embeddings from a pretrained image-text model (CLIP) for long video retrieval and classification. The key idea is to compute relevance scores for each frame of a long video and take a weighted average of the frame embeddings based on these scores. This allows frames that are more relevant or informative to be weighted higher compared to redundant or uninformative frames. The authors investigate three ways to compute frame relevance scores:1) Query scoring: Dot product similarity of each frame embedding with the text query embedding. No extra parameters.2) Self-attention scoring: A temporal transformer on just the sequence of frame embeddings, predicting a scalar score per frame.3) Joint-attention scoring: A temporal transformer on the frame embeddings plus the text query appended at the end, predicting scores per frame.The scored frame embeddings are softmaxed and used to compute a weighted average aggregation of the frames into a single video-level embedding. This simple weighted mean aggregation outperforms prior works with more complex aggregation methods like squeeze-and-excitation networks or cross-transformers. The strength of this approach lies in its simplicity and strong performance across several long video retrieval benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper aims to adapt image-text models like CLIP for long video retrieval tasks. Prior works have shown good results by using CLIP for video tasks in a method called "CLIP hitchhiking", but there has been limited success in learning better temporal aggregation methods on top of CLIP's per-frame features. - Simple mean pooling of CLIP embeddings works surprisingly well, outperforming more complex temporal modeling attempts. However, mean pooling is suboptimal for long videos where events may only last a few seconds. - The paper proposes a simple weighted mean aggregation method, where frames are weighted by their relevance scores. Three scoring methods are explored: query scoring, self-attention, and joint attention.- This weighted mean aggregation significantly outperforms prior temporal modeling attempts and mean pooling baselines. The simplicity and strong performance makes it a good baseline for long video retrieval.- Analysis provides insights into why the weighted mean works well - it maps frames into distinct embedding spaces, benefits from query conditioning during training, and restricts complex temporal modeling to linear combinations.In summary, the key focus is adapting CLIP better to long video retrieval via a simple but effective weighted mean aggregation method, which provides a strong baseline for the field. The analysis also aims to understand why this straightforward approach works better than more complex temporal modeling.
