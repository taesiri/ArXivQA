# [Let's Think Outside the Box: Exploring Leap-of-Thought in Large Language   Models with Creative Humor Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02439)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to enhance the non-sequential thinking and creative problem-solving abilities, known as Leap-of-Thought (LoT), of large language models (LLMs). LLMs excel at logical reasoning but struggle with creative tasks requiring thinking outside the box. To assess LLM's LoT skills, the authors leverage the Oogiri creative humor game which demands unexpected humor responses to images/text. They collect the large-scale multimodal Oogiri-GO dataset with over 130k samples. Experiments show advanced LLMs still lack sufficient LoT abilities for creative humor generation in Oogiri. To address this, CLoT relies on two stages - associable instruction tuning formulates Oogiri data into instructions for training LLM's basic LoT skills, and explorative self-refinement allows LLM to generate more creative data to self-improve its LoT ability. CLoT significantly enhances LLMs' performance across Oogiri tasks and generalizes well to other creative domains. This work offers valuable insights into improving LLMs for innovative applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) framework to improve large language models' ability to think creatively outside the box by using an Oogiri humor game dataset for associable instruction tuning and explorative self-refinement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It pioneers the exploration of the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) capability in large language models (LLMs), which is the ability for non-sequential, creative thinking by association. This is an important cognitive skill for innovation and creativity. 

2. It introduces a large-scale creative dataset called Oogiri-GO with over 130,000 samples of creative humor responses based on the Oogiri game. This provides a testbed for analyzing the LoT abilities of LLMs.

3. It proposes a novel Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) framework to enhance the LoT abilities of LLMs. CLoT has two key stages - associable instruction tuning and explorative self-refinement. Experiments show CLoT significantly improves the creative performance of LLMs.

4. The proposed CLoT demonstrates strong versatility across languages (English, Chinese, Japanese) and generalizes well to other creative tasks beyond humor generation.

In summary, this paper makes pioneering efforts towards understanding and improving the Leap-of-Thought capabilities of LLMs through a novel CLoT framework and a large-scale creative dataset Oogiri-GO. It opens up an important direction for enhancing innovation and creativity in LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Leap-of-Thought (LoT): Non-sequential, creative thinking paradigm that involves strong associations and knowledge leaps to bridge disparate ideas.

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Sequential thinking process where each thought builds on the previous one to logically reason step-by-step.  

- Oogiri Game: Traditional Japanese creative game that requires unexpected and humorous responses, making it suitable to assess LoT abilities.

- Oogiri-GO Dataset: Multimodal, multilingual dataset with over 130,000 Oogiri game samples used to evaluate LoT abilities.

- Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT): Proposed paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability via associable instruction tuning and explorative self-refinement.

- Associable Instruction Tuning: Transform Oogiri data into instructions to train LLM's associable generation and discrimination. 

- Explorative Self-Refinement: Allow LLM to generate more creative data under weakly-associated conditions and use it to refine itself.

So in summary, the key focus is on exploring and enhancing the Leap-of-Thought creative thinking abilities in large language models using the Oogiri game dataset and the proposed CLoT framework. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) framework to improve the leap-of-thought ability of large language models. Can you elaborate on why existing methods like fine-tuning and prompting are insufficient to achieve this goal?

2. One key component of CLoT is the associable instruction tuning stage. Can you explain the rationale behind the design of the instruction templates, especially the inclusion of empty/weakly-associated conditions? How do they facilitate creative exploration? 

3. The paper conducts associable instruction tuning via LoRA. What are the advantages of using LoRA compared to other tuning methods? Are there any potential limitations? 

4. In the explorative self-refinement stage, the paper extracts a set of nouns for sampling weakly-associated conditions. What are some strategies to ensure diversity when selecting this noun set? How might this impact model performance?

5. The paper argues that using weakly-associated conditions helps mitigate potential performance collapse during self-refinement. Can you analyze the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon?  

6. Compared to sequential reasoning methods like Chain-of-Thought, what are some unique challenges when evaluating the leap-of-thought ability of language models? How does the paper address them?

7. The paper evaluates CLoT on multilingual and multimodal models. What modifications need to be made to apply CLoT to single-modal or non-multilingual models?

8. How suitable is the Oogiri game for analyzing creativity compared to other humor tasks? What are its limitations and how might they impact conclusions about leap-of-thought abilities? 

9. The paper focuses on studying leap-of-thought for humor generation. How can we assess the versatility of CLoT for non-humor creative tasks? What metrics can be used?

10. What are some promising future directions for enhancing leap-of-thought in large language models, building upon ideas presented in this paper? Can you propose any methodological improvements to CLoT?
