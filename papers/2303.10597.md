# [Partial Network Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10597)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we efficiently transfer partial functionality from a source pre-trained neural network to a target pre-trained neural network, without modifying the weights of either network?

The authors propose a new approach called "partial network cloning" to tackle this challenge. The key ideas are:

1) Localize the part of the source network that is most relevant to the target functionality, without changing any weights. This is done using a local-performance based pruning technique. 

2) Insert the extracted module into the target network by cascading it to a certain layer, again without modifying weights. The insertion position is optimized to maximize performance on the target task while minimizing negative impact on the original task.

3) Jointly optimize the localization and insertion to find the best partial clone.

The goal is to enable flexible customization of pre-trained models without altering them, for applications like incremental learning and model reuse. The core research hypothesis seems to be that it's possible to effectively clone functionality between fixed neural networks through this localized extraction and insertion approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It introduces a novel task called Partial Network Cloning (PNC) for migrating knowledge from a pre-trained source network to a target network. 

- It proposes an effective scheme to solve PNC that conducts joint learnable localization and insertion of the transferable module between the source and target networks. The two operations reinforce each other to ensure good performance.

- It copies and pastes a module of parameters from the source network into the target network, without modifying the original parameters of either network. This allows flexibility in expanding network functionality while preserving original competence. 

- It achieves superior performance compared to conventional knowledge transfer settings like continual learning and model ensemble on several datasets. For example, it improves accuracy by 5-10% over continual learning.

- It reduces data dependency to only 30% of the original training data. 

- The cloned module can be readily removed from the target network to recover its original parameters and competence when needed. This enhances utility of model zoos.

In summary, this paper introduces the novel PNC task and an effective solution for it that outperforms prior methods. It allows flexible function expansion of networks while preserving original competence, enhancing model re-use.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces a novel approach for partial network cloning that enables flexible functionality addition to pre-trained neural networks. The key idea is to clone and insert part of the parameters from a source network into a target network without modifying the original weights, allowing the cloned module to be added or removed on demand. The proposed method achieves this via jointly learning to localize the transferable module in the source network and insert it into the target network in an optimal position.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective strategy for partial network cloning that clones functionality between pre-trained networks in a parameter-preserving manner.
