# [DrivingGaussian: Composite Gaussian Splatting for Surrounding Dynamic   Autonomous Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07920)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces DrivingGaussian, a novel framework for representing large-scale dynamic autonomous driving scenes using Composite Gaussian Splatting. It incrementally reconstructs the extensive static background with Incremental Static 3D Gaussians as the ego vehicle moves, while modeling multiple fast-moving objects with a Composite Dynamic Gaussian Graph. To initialize the Gaussians, it leverages LiDAR prior for more accurate geometry and consistency across surrounding multi-camera views. Experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in modeling driving scenes and enabling high-quality novel view synthesis. Key innovations include the composite representation for static and dynamic elements, incremental reconstruction of background, dynamic graph for moving objects, and use of LiDAR to initialize Gaussians. Limitations lie mainly in representing small, dense objects and reflective materials. Overall, DrivingGaussian effectively handles the complexity of dynamic driving scenes for tasks like view synthesis and corner case simulation.

The paper presents DrivingGaussian, a novel framework to represent large-scale dynamic autonomous driving scenes using composite Gaussian splatting, which incrementally reconstructs the static background and models multiple dynamic objects to enable high-quality surrounding view synthesis and dynamic scene reconstruction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. DrivingGaussian is the first representation and modeling framework for large-scale, dynamic driving scenes based on Composite Gaussian Splatting. 

2. Two novel modules are introduced: Incremental Static 3D Gaussians for reconstructing the static background incrementally, and Composite Dynamic Gaussian Graphs for modeling multiple dynamic objects individually and integrating them into the scene.

3. With the assistance of LiDAR prior, the proposed method facilitates the recovery of complete geometry in large-scale driving scenes. 

4. Comprehensive experiments show that DrivingGaussian outperforms previous methods in challenging autonomous driving benchmarks and enables corner case simulation for various downstream tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using Composite Gaussian Splatting to decompose and reconstruct both static backgrounds and dynamic objects in complex, large-scale driving scenes. The use of LiDAR prior also helps recover more accurate geometry. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in autonomous driving scene modeling and synthesis.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing large-scale dynamic autonomous driving scenes from sparse vehicle-mounted sensor data is challenging, especially when the ego vehicle moves at high speeds. The static background and dynamic objects undergo rapid changes depicted through limited outward multi-camera views. It becomes difficult to model such a 360-degree driving scene due to complex geometry, diverse optical degradation, spatiotemporal inconsistency, and multiple fast moving objects. Existing methods like NeRF struggle with such scenes due to reliance on ray sampling, while Gaussian Splatting methods fail to handle combined static-dynamic regions with multiple moving objects.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes DrivingGaussian, a novel framework to represent surrounding dynamic autonomous driving scenes using Composite Gaussian Splatting. It decomposes the scene into a static background and dynamic objects. 

1) For the static background, Incremental Static 3D Gaussians are introduced to progressively model the background with ego vehicle movement using multi-camera images from sequential timesteps.

2) For dynamic objects, a Composite Dynamic Gaussian Graph is proposed to individually reconstruct each object and restore their positions and occlusion relationships by transforming and integrating them into the static background.

3) A LiDAR prior is incorporated for accurate geometry and consistency across views. LiDAR points are fused with images to obtain better Gaussian initialization.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to represent large-scale dynamic driving scenes using Composite Gaussian Splatting
- Proposes two novel modules - Incremental Static 3D Gaussians and Composite Dynamic Gaussian Graph
- LiDAR prior provides accurate geometry and multi-view consistency
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on autonomous driving datasets 
- Enables dynamic scene construction and corner case simulation to validate driving systems

In summary, the paper decomposes complex dynamic driving scenes into static and dynamic regions, representing them using novel Gaussian modules, aided by LiDAR prior. This enables high-fidelity scene modeling and synthesis across tasks.
