## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Remote sensing (RS) images have complex and diverse geographical landscapes and objects that are not adequately captured in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). 
- Existing methods neglect multi-level visual information critical for full vision-language alignment and holistic RS image understanding.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct large-scale RS image-text dataset \ALIGNMENTNAME using open geospatial data to embed comprehensive RS knowledge into models.
- Create instructional dataset \SFTNAME tailored for RS by transforming RS datasets and using GPT-4 to generate complex reasoning data.  
- Propose specialized MLLM \MODELNAME using novel multi-level vision-language alignment strategy and curriculum learning to exploit full potential of datasets.

Key Contributions:
- \ALIGNMENTNAME dataset with 1.15M high-quality global RS image-text pairs capturing diverse geographical features.
- \SFTNAME multimodal instruction dataset for various RS tasks with complex reasoning data.  
- \MODELNAME MLLM with superior performance on RS classification, VQA, visual grounding through innovative alignment approach and training methodology.
- Thorough experiments prove state-of-the-art capabilities of \MODELNAME for nuanced RS reasoning and analysis.

In summary, the paper introduces high-quality datasets and a specialized MLLM to address challenges of complex RS image understanding, through multi-level alignment and tailored training strategies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the profoundly enhanced reasoning and perceptual capabilities unlocked in the RS domain.
