# [DreamControl: Control-Based Text-to-3D Generation with 3D Self-Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06439)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes DreamControl, a two-stage framework for generating high-quality 3D content from text descriptions. In the first stage, it optimizes a coarse neural radiance field (NeRF) scene as a 3D self-prior using score distillation sampling (SDS). To alleviate inconsistent geometry (the Janus problem), it presents an adaptive viewpoint sampling strategy to match the viewpoint bias of the 2D diffusion model and a boundary integrity metric to automatically terminate optimization. In the second stage, it renders the 3D prior as edge conditions and adopts ControlNet for fine-grained texture generation while maintaining geometry consistency. To stabilize this control-based optimization, it proposes a conditional LoRA to predict noise based on normal maps and a weighted score distillation loss. Experiments demonstrate DreamControl's ability to produce diverse 3D content with high geometric consistency and texture fidelity. The control-based framework also enables user-guided 3D generation based on sketches and 3D animation by conditioning on template skeletons.
