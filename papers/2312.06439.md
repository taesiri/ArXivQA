# [DreamControl: Control-Based Text-to-3D Generation with 3D Self-Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06439)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes DreamControl, a two-stage framework for generating high-quality 3D content from text descriptions. In the first stage, it optimizes a coarse neural radiance field (NeRF) scene as a 3D self-prior using score distillation sampling (SDS). To alleviate inconsistent geometry (the Janus problem), it presents an adaptive viewpoint sampling strategy to match the viewpoint bias of the 2D diffusion model and a boundary integrity metric to automatically terminate optimization. In the second stage, it renders the 3D prior as edge conditions and adopts ControlNet for fine-grained texture generation while maintaining geometry consistency. To stabilize this control-based optimization, it proposes a conditional LoRA to predict noise based on normal maps and a weighted score distillation loss. Experiments demonstrate DreamControl's ability to produce diverse 3D content with high geometric consistency and texture fidelity. The control-based framework also enables user-guided 3D generation based on sketches and 3D animation by conditioning on template skeletons.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework with 3D self-prior generation and control-based score distillation. What are the motivations and rationales behind this two-stage design? How do the two stages complement each other?

10. The method has a risk of generating malicious content like other generative models. What solutions can be adopted to detect and mitigate such risks? What directions can further research take to address this?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DreamControl: Control-Based Text-to-3D Generation with 3D Self-Prior":

Problem:
Existing text-to-3D generation methods based on 2D-lifting suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry, known as the Janus problem. This is mainly caused by two issues - (1) viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models, and (2) overfitting of the optimization objective during training. Recent methods aim to incorporate 3D prior knowledge into 2D diffusion models, but compromise on texture fidelity and lack generalizability due to limited 3D training data.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a two-stage framework called DreamControl to generate high-quality 3D content with consistent geometry and detailed texture. 
1) In the first stage, a coarse 3D scene is optimized as a self-prior using score distillation on NeRF. Adaptive viewpoint sampling and a boundary integrity metric are proposed to alleviate inconsistent geometry.  
2) In the second stage, the 3D prior guides the optimization via control-based score distillation to generate fine details while maintaining geometry consistency. A conditional LoRA and weighted score are used to stabilize this optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes optimizing NeRF as a 3D self-prior, using adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric to improve geometry consistency.
- Introduces control-based score distillation to maintain prior geometry while generating detailed texture, using conditional LoRA and weighted score for stabilization.  
- The two-stage framework DreamControl generates high-quality 3D content from text regarding both geometric consistency and texture fidelity.
- The control-based optimization enables applicability to downstream tasks like user-guided 3D generation and 3D animation.
