# [Mapping Degeneration Meets Label Evolution: Learning Infrared Small   Target Detection with Single Point Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we develop a new framework for infrared small target detection that only requires single point supervision rather than expensive pixel-level annotations?

The key hypothesis is that by leveraging an interesting "mapping degeneration" phenomenon in CNN training under point supervision, the proposed label evolution framework can automatically regress pixel-level pseudo labels from only point labels. This allows training CNNs to achieve pixel-level infrared small target detection in an end-to-end manner with much weaker supervision.

In summary, the paper aims to reduce the annotation cost for infrared small target detection by proposing a novel weakly-supervised framework that leverages point labels to automatically generate pseudo masks for training. The core idea is built upon the discovered "mapping degeneration" phenomenon and a label evolution technique.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel weakly supervised framework for infrared small target detection using only point-level supervision. Specifically:

- The paper makes the first attempt to achieve infrared small target detection with only point labels, which significantly reduces annotation cost compared to pixel-level mask supervision. 

- The paper discovers an interesting "mapping degeneration" phenomenon when training with point supervision, where CNNs first learn to segment pixels near targets then converge to predict point labels.

- Based on this observation, the paper proposes a label evolution framework called LESPS to leverage the intermediate CNN predictions to progressively expand the point labels to pseudo masks. This allows end-to-end pixel-level detection from only points.

- Experiments show the proposed method enables networks to recover 70%+ of fully supervised performance in IOU and 95%+ in detection probability using just point labels.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel weakly supervised framework that can achieve competitive pixel-level infrared small target detection using only point annotations, greatly reducing annotation cost. The discovery of mapping degeneration and the proposed label evolution technique are central to enabling this capability.
