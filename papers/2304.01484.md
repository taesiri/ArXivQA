# [Mapping Degeneration Meets Label Evolution: Learning Infrared Small   Target Detection with Single Point Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we develop a new framework for infrared small target detection that only requires single point supervision rather than expensive pixel-level annotations?

The key hypothesis is that by leveraging an interesting "mapping degeneration" phenomenon in CNN training under point supervision, the proposed label evolution framework can automatically regress pixel-level pseudo labels from only point labels. This allows training CNNs to achieve pixel-level infrared small target detection in an end-to-end manner with much weaker supervision.

In summary, the paper aims to reduce the annotation cost for infrared small target detection by proposing a novel weakly-supervised framework that leverages point labels to automatically generate pseudo masks for training. The core idea is built upon the discovered "mapping degeneration" phenomenon and a label evolution technique.
