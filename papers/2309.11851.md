# [DEYOv3: DETR with YOLO for Real-time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- DETR relies heavily on ImageNet pretraining which limits backbone design and generalization ability. It also has high computational costs limiting practical use.  
- Existing real-time detectors like YOLO rely on NMS which is a bottleneck for accuracy and speed.

Proposed Solution:
- A new 2-stage training method called "step-by-step training" that eliminates the need for ImageNet pretraining. 
- Stage 1: Pretrain a YOLO model from scratch to initialize the backbone and neck of the end-to-end model. This provides better initialization than ImageNet.
- Stage 2: Only train the decoder from scratch while keeping the backbone and neck fixed. This accelerates convergence.

- A new real-time end-to-end model called DEYOv3 that combines YOLO (one-to-many branch) with a transformer decoder (one-to-one branch).
- Eliminates NMS and has an efficient encoder design making it fast.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes step-by-step training to remove reliance on ImageNet and enable flexibility in backbone design. Achieves better performance than DETR training.
- Introduces DEYOv3, a SOTA real-time end-to-end detector that surpasses all existing methods without using additional datasets. Runs up to 270 FPS.
- Ablation studies analyze impact of step-by-step training and performance differences between one-to-many and one-to-one branches.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel training strategy and model design that advances the state-of-the-art in real-time end-to-end object detection. The method does not rely on external datasets and achieves an excellent combination of accuracy and speed.
