# [Multiscale Structure Guided Diffusion for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01789)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can image-conditioned diffusion probabilistic models (icDPMs) be made more robust and generalizable for image deblurring, particularly when applied to out-of-domain test data?

The key hypothesis proposed is that incorporating an auxiliary multiscale structure guidance into the icDPM can improve its generalization ability and make it more constrained/robust for deblurring unseen images. 

In particular, the paper investigates:

- The generalization ability and domain sensitivity of existing icDPM methods for deblurring. 

- A proposed multiscale guidance module extracted from a regression network, which provides structural prior information to the icDPM.

- Whether this guidance can enhance model robustness, improve deblurring and reduce artifacts when applied to out-of-domain images.

So in summary, the central research question is about improving the generalization of icDPMs for deblurring via an auxiliary guidance mechanism, with a focus on evaluating performance on out-of-domain test data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Investigating and analyzing the domain generalization of conditional diffusion models in motion deblurring, and finding a relationship between model robustness and image conditioning.

2. Proposing a multiscale structure guidance module that provides auxiliary sharp structure information to the diffusion model. This is designed to make the model more robust to domain shifts. 

3. Demonstrating improved generalization performance with the proposed guidance module. The paper shows the model achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality on unseen blurry image datasets, while maintaining competitive distortion metrics.

In summary, the key contribution is enhancing the image-conditioned diffusion probabilistic model for deblurring via a learned multiscale structure guidance. This improves the model's ability to generalize to new datasets by making the conditioning more effective. The proposed method is evaluated on diverse blurry image datasets and shown to produce higher quality results on unseen data compared to existing methods.
