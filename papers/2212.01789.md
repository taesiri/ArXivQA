# [Multiscale Structure Guided Diffusion for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01789)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can image-conditioned diffusion probabilistic models (icDPMs) be made more robust and generalizable for image deblurring, particularly when applied to out-of-domain test data?The key hypothesis proposed is that incorporating an auxiliary multiscale structure guidance into the icDPM can improve its generalization ability and make it more constrained/robust for deblurring unseen images. In particular, the paper investigates:- The generalization ability and domain sensitivity of existing icDPM methods for deblurring. - A proposed multiscale guidance module extracted from a regression network, which provides structural prior information to the icDPM.- Whether this guidance can enhance model robustness, improve deblurring and reduce artifacts when applied to out-of-domain images.So in summary, the central research question is about improving the generalization of icDPMs for deblurring via an auxiliary guidance mechanism, with a focus on evaluating performance on out-of-domain test data.
