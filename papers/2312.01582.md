# [Explaining with Contrastive Phrasal Highlighting: A Case Study in   Assisting Humans to Detect Translation Differences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01582)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new approach to generating contrastive phrasal highlights that explain the predictions of NLP models comparing two text inputs. The method aligns phrases across the inputs and highlights minimal phrase pairs whose removal increases the model's prediction of semantic equivalence. Through proxy evaluation on a dataset of human rationales and two IRB-approved user studies, the authors demonstrate that these highlights help bilingual speakers more reliably annotate fine-grained meaning differences in translations and detect critical machine translation errors. Specifically, the highlights assist crowdworkers with challenging tasks like identifying subtle translation divergences and local mistranslations that flip meaning. The paper argues that for translation and other tasks involving text comparison, explanations should be contrastive, i.e. show differences between inputs rather than just highlight important tokens. This work contributes the first rigorous human evaluation of highlight-based explanations on realistic applications like translation quality assurance. Key limitations are reliance on high-quality alignment and examining only high-resource languages. Overall, it provides evidence that properly-designed contrastive highlights can effectively guide people performing cognitively demanding NLP tasks.
