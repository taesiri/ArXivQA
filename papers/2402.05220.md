# [On Parameter Estimation in Deviated Gaussian Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05220)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of parameter estimation in "deviated Gaussian mixture of experts" models, where the data is generated from a mixture of a known function $g_0(Y|X)$ and a Gaussian mixture of experts term $p_{G_*}(Y|X)$. Specifically, the goal is to estimate the mixing proportion $\lambda^*$ and mixing measure $G_*$ defining the Gaussian mixture component. This problem arises in goodness-of-fit testing when testing whether data comes from $g_0(Y|X)$ or the full mixture model. Parameter estimation is challenging due to interactions between $g_0$ and $p_{G_*}$ and between parameters of the Gaussian densities.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate $\lambda^*$ and $G_*$. To analyze the convergence rate of the MLE, the paper introduces a novel "distinguishability condition" to characterize the interaction between $g_0$ and $p_{G_*}$. Under "distinguishable" settings when this condition holds, there is no interaction and convergence analysis resembles standard Gaussian mixtures. Under "non-distinguishable" settings when the condition fails, the interaction must be accounted for. 

The paper introduces new "Voronoi loss functions" $D_1$, $D_2$ to precisely characterize the estimation rate of individual components, unlike previous generalized Wasserstein loss functions. These metrics capture different rates for components fitted by multiple vs single fitted components.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes density estimation convergence rate of MLE to be $\tilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$  
- Proves parametric estimation rates for mixing proportion $\lambda^*$ and exactly fitted components of $G_*$
- Derives slower rates for overfitted components depending on algebraic constraints between Gaussian parameters
- Demonstrates advantages of new Voronoi loss functions over generalized Wasserstein loss
- Provides novel analysis handling interactions between $g_0$ and $p_{G_*}$ under non-distinguishable settings

Overall the paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of a challenging parameter estimation problem with practical relevance. The introduction of tailored Voronoi loss functions and handling of interactions under non-distinguishable settings are significant contributions.
