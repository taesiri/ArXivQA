# [A Novel Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System for Flying   Ad Hoc Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04135)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (FL-IDS) tailored for flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). FL-IDS operates in a decentralized manner, with each UAV training an intrusion detection model locally using its own data. Only the model weight updates are shared with a central server for aggregation into a global model, preserving data privacy. FL-IDS is evaluated on a realistic FANET dataset across three attacks - sinkhole, blackhole, and flooding against the AODV routing protocol. The results demonstrate FL-IDS achieves a high detection accuracy comparable to a Centralized IDS, while significantly reducing communication costs. A comparative analysis also reveals superior performance over a purely Local IDS. Additionally, a bias towards specific participating clients further refines FL-IDS, surpassing centralized approaches even at lower attacker ratios by focusing on the best detectors. This study makes notable contributions through the proposal of the first decentralized privacy-preserving intrusion detection system uniquely designed for FANETs and backed by extensive evaluation across factors like detection accuracy, communication efficiency and privacy.
