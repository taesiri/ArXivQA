# [The Treasure Beneath Multiple Annotations: An Uncertainty-aware Edge   Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11828)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize the inherent ambiguity in multiple edge annotations to improve edge detection performance. 

The key hypothesis is that modeling the uncertainty underlying diverse edge annotations can help capture the ambiguity and improve edge detection. Specifically, the authors propose converting the deterministic edge labels into distributions to explore label uncertainty.

The main contributions are:

1) Proposing an uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED) which introduces a learnable Gaussian distribution with a variance branch to model label uncertainty. 

2) Using the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty to guide training, by focusing on pixels with higher uncertainty.

3) Designing a weighted loss function that progressively emphasizes pixels with higher uncertainty.

4) Demonstrating consistent improvements by combining UAED with various encoder-decoder models on edge detection benchmarks.

In summary, this paper focuses on modeling uncertainty to handle ambiguous edge annotations, in contrast to prior work that mainly concentrates on designing network architectures. The central hypothesis is that learning from label uncertainty can boost edge detection performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED) to model the inherent ambiguity in edge detection caused by multiple subjective annotations. Specifically:

- They introduce uncertainty estimation into edge detection by converting the label space into a learnable Gaussian distribution. The variance of the distribution is learned to measure the ambiguity among different annotations. 

- They utilize the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty to guide the training. Pixels with higher uncertainty are treated as hard samples and emphasized during training with a progressively weighted loss. 

- Extensive experiments show UAED brings consistent improvement when combined with various backbone networks on edge detection benchmarks. UAED achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring less computation than transformer-based methods.

In summary, the key innovation is exploring the uncertainty underlying multiple edge annotations and designing an uncertainty-driven edge detector, which is the first work to model uncertainty for the edge detection task. The proposed UAED effectively utilizes the uncertainty estimation to boost performance across different network architectures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware edge detection method called UAED that captures the inherent ambiguity in edge annotations from multiple annotators by modeling the label space as a learnable distribution, estimating variance as uncertainty to guide training emphasis on uncertain pixels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few points comparing this paper to other research in edge detection:

- This paper proposes a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Edge Detection (UAED) that incorporates uncertainty estimation into the edge detection task. Most prior work has focused on designing better network architectures and ignored exploring the inherent ambiguity in the label space from multiple annotators. Modeling uncertainty is a new direction for edge detection.

- The key idea is to convert the deterministic labels into distributions and add a branch to estimate the variance as the uncertainty. The estimated uncertainty is used to weigh the loss function to focus training on pixels with higher uncertainty. This is a unique way of utilizing the estimated uncertainty.

- UAED can be combined with various CNN and transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures as a plug-and-play module. Experiments show consistent improvement across different backbones, demonstrating its general applicability. 

- Compared to the current state-of-the-art transformer-based method EDTER, UAED achieves comparable or better performance while requiring less computation resources and time. So it provides a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

- Extensive experiments on BSDS and Multicue datasets show UAED outperforms previous methods by a large margin. The idea of modeling uncertainty is proven to be effective for boosting edge detection performance.

- A limitation is that UAED still relies on pixel-level annotations. Reducing annotation dependence remains an open issue for future exploration in this field.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by being the first to model uncertainty for edge detection. The proposed UAED framework is shown to be widely applicable and delivers new state-of-the-art results. It opens up a new direction for further improving edge detection by looking beyond architectural design and utilizing uncertainty information.
