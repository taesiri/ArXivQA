# [The Treasure Beneath Multiple Annotations: An Uncertainty-aware Edge   Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11828)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize the inherent ambiguity in multiple edge annotations to improve edge detection performance. 

The key hypothesis is that modeling the uncertainty underlying diverse edge annotations can help capture the ambiguity and improve edge detection. Specifically, the authors propose converting the deterministic edge labels into distributions to explore label uncertainty.

The main contributions are:

1) Proposing an uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED) which introduces a learnable Gaussian distribution with a variance branch to model label uncertainty. 

2) Using the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty to guide training, by focusing on pixels with higher uncertainty.

3) Designing a weighted loss function that progressively emphasizes pixels with higher uncertainty.

4) Demonstrating consistent improvements by combining UAED with various encoder-decoder models on edge detection benchmarks.

In summary, this paper focuses on modeling uncertainty to handle ambiguous edge annotations, in contrast to prior work that mainly concentrates on designing network architectures. The central hypothesis is that learning from label uncertainty can boost edge detection performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED) to model the inherent ambiguity in edge detection caused by multiple subjective annotations. Specifically:

- They introduce uncertainty estimation into edge detection by converting the label space into a learnable Gaussian distribution. The variance of the distribution is learned to measure the ambiguity among different annotations. 

- They utilize the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty to guide the training. Pixels with higher uncertainty are treated as hard samples and emphasized during training with a progressively weighted loss. 

- Extensive experiments show UAED brings consistent improvement when combined with various backbone networks on edge detection benchmarks. UAED achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring less computation than transformer-based methods.

In summary, the key innovation is exploring the uncertainty underlying multiple edge annotations and designing an uncertainty-driven edge detector, which is the first work to model uncertainty for the edge detection task. The proposed UAED effectively utilizes the uncertainty estimation to boost performance across different network architectures.
