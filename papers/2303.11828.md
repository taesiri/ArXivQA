# [The Treasure Beneath Multiple Annotations: An Uncertainty-aware Edge   Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11828)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize the inherent ambiguity in multiple edge annotations to improve edge detection performance. 

The key hypothesis is that modeling the uncertainty underlying diverse edge annotations can help capture the ambiguity and improve edge detection. Specifically, the authors propose converting the deterministic edge labels into distributions to explore label uncertainty.

The main contributions are:

1) Proposing an uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED) which introduces a learnable Gaussian distribution with a variance branch to model label uncertainty. 

2) Using the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty to guide training, by focusing on pixels with higher uncertainty.

3) Designing a weighted loss function that progressively emphasizes pixels with higher uncertainty.

4) Demonstrating consistent improvements by combining UAED with various encoder-decoder models on edge detection benchmarks.

In summary, this paper focuses on modeling uncertainty to handle ambiguous edge annotations, in contrast to prior work that mainly concentrates on designing network architectures. The central hypothesis is that learning from label uncertainty can boost edge detection performance.
