# [Doubly Abductive Counterfactual Inference for Text-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02981)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Doubly Abductive Counterfactual Inference for Text-based Image Editing":

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of text-based image editing (TBIE), where the goal is to edit a single input image to match a textual description, while preserving fidelity to the original image. However, existing methods struggle to achieve a good balance between editability (ability to perform desired edits) and fidelity. 

The authors formulate TBIE as a counterfactual inference problem on top of text-conditional diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. This formulates the fidelity objective as abducting an exogenous variable U that encodes details of the input image. However, due to overfitting of U to the input, editability suffers.

Proposed Solution: 
To address this tradeoff, the authors propose a Doubly Abductive Counterfactual (DAC) framework with two abduction steps:

1. Abduct U to reconstruct the input image under the original text description. This encodes fidelity.

2. Abduct another variable Δ that transitions the image under the original text to match the editing text. While Δ overfits, inverting it recovers editability. 

By combining suitable U and Δ, DAC achieves better balance of editability and fidelity.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates TBIE as a counterfactual inference problem, formalizing the tradeoff between editability and fidelity

- Proposes the DAC framework with two abduction steps to address this tradeoff

- Shows that DAC supports diverse edit types like addition, removal, manipulation etc. with higher quality than previous approaches

- Provides extensive analysis on design choices and comparisons to validate the improved editability and fidelity of DAC

In summary, the paper makes TBIE amenable to formal analysis using counterfactual inference, and develops the DAC framework to address a key limitation of overfitting leading to reduced editability, demonstrating improved versatility and quality over previous TBIE techniques.
