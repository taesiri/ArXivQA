# [Goodness-of-Fit and Clustering of Spherical Data: the QuadratiK package   in R and Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper introduces a new R and Python package called QuadratiK that provides innovative statistical methods for goodness-of-fit testing and clustering analysis based on kernel-based quadratic distances (KBQDs). KBQDs offer a flexible framework for assessing compatibility of data with assumed distributions and for comparing multiple data samples. However, there is a lack of accessible and unified software implementing recent advances in KBQD methodologies. 

Proposed Solution:
The QuadratiK package bridges this gap by offering user-friendly implementations of mathematical and computationally efficient KBQD tests and clustering techniques, including:

- One-sample, two-sample and k-sample goodness-of-fit tests
- Tests of uniformity on multidimensional spheres 
- Algorithms for generating random samples from spherical distributions
- A clustering algorithm tailored for directional/spherical data

The package is available in both R and Python, includes optimized C++ code for computational efficiency, and provides functions for tuning parameters and validating results. A graphical dashboard interface is also offered to increase accessibility.

Main Contributions:

- Provides accessible, unified implementations of recent methodological advances in kernel-based analysis, spanning goodness-of-fit testing to spherical clustering

- Offers these techniques to both R and Python users, enhancing adoption across statistics and machine learning communities

- Includes computational optimizations via C++ along with tools for parameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization 

- Introduces new capabilities for working with spherical data, including assessing uniformity, simulation, and clustering

- Presents an easy-to-use dashboard to make these advanced methods accessible to non-programmers

In summary, QuadratiK is an innovative software package that makes sophisticated KBQD statistical techniques for distributional testing and clustering accessible to diverse audiences in an efficient, validated, and interpretable manner.
