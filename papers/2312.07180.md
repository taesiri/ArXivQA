## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Context-Aware Iteration Policy Network to enable efficient optical flow estimation by determining the optimal number of iterations for each sample. The key idea is to rely on contextual information, including previous and future iterations information, to realize whether the flow improvement is limited or minimal. Specifically, historical hidden cells and iteration embeddings provide previous iterations information to indicate if a bottleneck is encountered. An incremental loss helps the policy network perceive the magnitude of future flow improvements. With these contextual cues, the lightweight policy network can accurately decide when to skip iterations while maintaining performance. Experiments demonstrate around 40%/20% FLOPs reduction on Sintel/KITTI datasets while preserving accuracy. The dynamic network is also user-controllable - by tuning the resource preference value, users can easily trade off between efficiency and performance based on computational budgets. Through both methodological and empirical contributions, this paper presents an effective way to enable efficient recurrent inference for optical flow estimation.
