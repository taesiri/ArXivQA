# [One Solution is Not All You Need: Few-Shot Extrapolation via Structured   MaxEnt RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis seems to be that learning diverse behaviors for accomplishing a task can enable an agent to generalize to new situations and environments, without needing to explicitly train on varied environments or perturbations. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Learning multiple diverse policies/skills for solving a task using a single training environment can provide robustness when that environment changes at test time. - The diversity encourages the agent to find many solutions to the task, so even if one solution fails in a new situation, another may still succeed.- This approach can allow generalization to new environments without having access to an explicit distribution of environments/tasks during training.- Theoretical analysis connects the diversity objective to a robustness guarantee over a set of test MDPs.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that structured diversity-driven learning can enable few-shot generalization to new situations, without requiring manual perturbation during training. The key insight is that diverse skills learned on a single task encapsulate behaviors that can adapt to new environments.
