# [One Solution is Not All You Need: Few-Shot Extrapolation via Structured   MaxEnt RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis seems to be that learning diverse behaviors for accomplishing a task can enable an agent to generalize to new situations and environments, without needing to explicitly train on varied environments or perturbations. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Learning multiple diverse policies/skills for solving a task using a single training environment can provide robustness when that environment changes at test time. - The diversity encourages the agent to find many solutions to the task, so even if one solution fails in a new situation, another may still succeed.- This approach can allow generalization to new environments without having access to an explicit distribution of environments/tasks during training.- Theoretical analysis connects the diversity objective to a robustness guarantee over a set of test MDPs.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that structured diversity-driven learning can enable few-shot generalization to new situations, without requiring manual perturbation during training. The key insight is that diverse skills learned on a single task encapsulate behaviors that can adapt to new environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a framework for policy robustness in reinforcement learning by optimizing for diversity. Rather than training a single policy to be robust across different environments, the key idea is to learn multiple policies such that collectively they are robust to varying environments. The paper introduces an algorithm called Structured Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (SMERL) which optimizes an objective that encourages diversity among learned policies while also ensuring they achieve near-optimal return on a training MDP. The paper provides a theoretical analysis showing how this objective can be derived and connected to robustness over a set of MDPs. It also empirically evaluates SMERL on navigation tasks and continuous control environments, demonstrating that it can quickly adapt to new test conditions and outperforms prior methods like standard RL, adversarial RL, and unsupervised diversity learning.In summary, the main contribution seems to be presenting a paradigm for achieving robustness in RL by optimizing for diversity during training, enabled by the proposed SMERL algorithm and supported by theoretical results and experimental evaluation. This provides an alternative to methods like domain randomization or adversarial training for handling varying environments.
