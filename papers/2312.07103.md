# [The Computational Complexity of Concise Hypersphere Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07103)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper performs the first complexity-theoretic study of the hypersphere classification problem for binary data, an important cornerstone of machine learning. While the analogous problem for real-valued data is efficiently solvable, the authors show hypersphere classification becomes NP-hard for binary data, even with highly restricted inputs such as only two red or blue vectors. To explore finer-grained boundaries of (in)tractability, the authors use the lens of parameterized complexity to analyze the impact of conciseness constraints and structural properties like treewidth that could be leveraged algorithmically. Their technical contributions include new parameterized algorithms, including for the settings with bounded data or explanation conciseness, complemented by evidence that some parameterizations likely cannot achieve fixed-parameter tractability. Ultimately, the results provide a comprehensive complexity classification based on all possible combinations of natural parameters measuring conciseness and input structure. By settling open questions about the complexity landscape for this important problem, the work helps better understand fundamental tradeoffs between accuracy, efficiency and interpretability in classification.
