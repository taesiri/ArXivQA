# [Less is More: Focus Attention for Efficient DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12612)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the efficiency and accuracy trade-off in DETR-like object detection models? The key hypotheses are:1) Current DETR models treat all tokens equally in the encoder, leading to redundant computation on uninformative background tokens. Selecting a subset of informative foreground tokens can improve efficiency.2) Simply reducing the overall number of tokens can hurt detection accuracy. We need smarter strategies to selectively focus computation on the most useful tokens.3) Stacking localization and semantic cues can help identify the most informative foreground and object tokens for enhanced attention. 4) Reconstructing the encoder with dual attention on foreground and fine-grained object tokens can improve semantics while minimizing extra computation.In summary, the central goal is developing a token selection and attention strategy to focus computations on the most useful tokens, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy trade-offs in DETR-like models. The key ideas are using stacked localization/semantic scores for selection and dual attention for enhancement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Focus-DETR, a new object detection model based on DETR that focuses attention on more informative tokens for better trade-off between computation efficiency and accuracy. 2. It introduces a scoring mechanism that considers both localization and category semantic information from multi-scale feature maps to explicitly discriminate foreground and fine-grained object tokens at different semantic levels.3. It reconstructs the encoder with dual attention - enhanced self-attention for fine-grained tokens and deformable attention for foreground tokens, which enhances the semantic information of queries while balancing performance and cost.4. Extensive experiments show Focus-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other sparse DETR methods like Sparse DETR and PnP-DETR under similar settings. When applied to DINO, it loses only 0.5 AP but reduces computation by 45% and improves inference speed by 40.8%.In summary, the key innovation is the multi-level scoring mechanism and dual attention encoder that allows Focus-DETR to focus computations on the most informative tokens, leading to better efficiency without compromising accuracy. The results demonstrate its effectiveness for sparse modeling of DETR-like detectors.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Focus-DETR, a new object detection model based on DETR that focuses attention on more informative tokens by using a scoring mechanism to select foreground and fine-grained object tokens and enhancing them through dual attention in the encoder, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy compared to prior DETR variants.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:- The use of DETR-like models for object detection has become popular recently, with many works aiming to improve their efficiency and accuracy. This paper focuses specifically on improving the transformer encoder in DETR models.- Previous works like Sparse DETR and PnP-DETR have tried reducing computations in the encoder by pruning background tokens. However, this paper argues those methods have suboptimal token selection strategies that overly rely on the decoder's cross attention. - Instead, this paper proposes a new scoring mechanism called Focus-DETR that considers both localization and semantic information to select informative foreground and object tokens from multi-scale features. - The proposed dual attention mechanism in the encoder further enhances fine-grained object tokens and remedies limitations of deformable attention. This enables Focus-DETR to balance accuracy and efficiency.- Experiments show Focus-DETR outperforms Sparse DETR and achieves comparable complexity and improved AP compared to state-of-the-art sparse DETR detectors. The approach also generalizes well to different DETR architectures.- Overall, Focus-DETR provides a novel encoder design for sparse DETR-like models, with more reliable token selection and enhancement strategies. The results demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy over related sparse encoding approaches for DETR models.In summary, this paper makes contributions in sparse encoding specifically for DETR-like models, with a new scoring mechanism and encoder design to focus attention on informative tokens. The approach shows promise over prior works in improving speed and accuracy trade-offs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring more hierarchical semantic grading strategies for tokens, such as distinguishing object boundaries vs centers. The current method in the paper focuses on coarse foreground/background discrimination and general objectness scores, but more fine-grained semantic distinctions could be useful.- Developing a unified feature scoring and selection mechanism throughout the entire Transformer model, rather than just the encoder. The authors currently reconstruct the encoder with dual attention, but suggest expanding similar ideas across the full model.- Applying similar token pruning and attention focusing approaches to other Transformer-based vision models beyond object detection, such as semantic segmentation, action recognition, etc. The core ideas could generalize.- Further improving the computational efficiency and speed of the model - the current method reduces FLOPs substantially but there is still room for improvement in latency and throughput.- Developing methods to automatically determine the optimal pruning ratios, rather than manually tuning or scheduling them. Making the model determine important tokens in a more adaptive, dynamic way.- Combining the approach here with other model compression techniques like knowledge distillation, quantization, etc. to push efficiency even further.So in summary, the main suggestions are around 1) more granular semantic scoring, 2) model-wide attention focusing, 3) application to broader vision tasks, 4) further efficiency improvements, 5) dynamic token selection, and 6) combining with other compression techniques. The core idea of pruning less important tokens and focusing attention seems very promising to build on.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents Focus-DETR, a method to focus attention on more informative tokens for efficient object detection using Transformers. The key ideas are:1) A scoring mechanism considers both localization and category semantic information from multi-scale feature maps to explicitly discriminate foreground and fine-grained object tokens. 2) Based on the scoring, foreground tokens and fine-grained object tokens are fed into the encoder with dual attention. This enhances the semantic interaction of object queries while remedying limitations of deformable attention. 3) Extensive experiments show Focus-DETR achieves better efficiency and accuracy trade-offs. For example, it obtains 50.4 AP on COCO using 154 GFLOPs, outperforming prior work Sparse DETR which gets 48.2 AP using 152 GFLOPs.In summary, Focus-DETR improves Transformer-based detectors by focusing attention on more informative tokens, via explicit semantic level discrimination and fine-grained feature enhancement. This leads to better efficiency and performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new object detection model called Focus-DETR that focuses attention on more informative tokens to improve efficiency and accuracy. The key ideas are 1) a scoring mechanism that considers both localization and semantic information to identify foreground and fine-grained object tokens and 2) a dual attention encoder that enhances interactions between the fine-grained object tokens. Specifically, the model uses a Foreground Token Selector (FTS) that assigns foreground probabilities to tokens using ground truth bounding boxes. It also has a multi-category score predictor to identify fine-grained object tokens likely to belong to object categories. These object tokens then go through an encoder with dual attention, which allows enhanced self-attention between the fine-grained tokens and updates the foreground token features. This allows Focus-DETR to focus computations on the most useful tokens. Experiments show Focus-DETR improves accuracy and efficiency over prior work like Sparse DETR, with higher AP scores and reduced GFLOPs. The model is also generalizable to different DETR architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes Focus-DETR, a method to improve the efficiency of DETR-like object detectors by focusing attention on the most informative tokens. The key ideas are:1) A foreground token selector (FTS) module that scores each token based on whether it belongs to the foreground, using supervision from ground truth boxes. It uses top-down modulation across multi-scale features for better foreground selection. 2) A multi-category score predictor that further scores the foreground tokens based on their objectiveness, selecting a small subset of fine-grained object tokens. 3) A dual attention encoder that first enhances the fine-grained object tokens using self-attention, then scatters the enhanced features back to the original foreground tokens. This improves their semantics with minimal computation cost.4) A cascade token selection approach that gradually reduces the number of selected tokens across encoder layers, enhancing fault tolerance.Together, these focus attention on the most informative tokens for efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The method improves over prior work like Sparse DETR that relies on less reliable selection mechanisms. Experiments show state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency on COCO.
