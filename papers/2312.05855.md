# [NeVRF: Neural Video-based Radiance Fields for Long-duration Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05855)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NeVRF: Neural Video-based Radiance Fields for Long-duration Sequences":

Problem:
Generating dynamic radiance fields for photo-realistic free-viewpoint video of long-duration dynamic scenes remains challenging. Existing methods struggle to balance quality and storage size. They also have difficulty handling complex scene changes over long durations, like topological changes and large motions. In addition, previous methods require all sequence data upfront for training, making them unfeasible for endless streams of sequential data.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel neural video-based radiance field (NeVRF) representation to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1) Multi-View Radiance Blending: Directly predict radiance from multi-view input videos instead of a canonical space. Use a shared encoder for view features and a network to predict blending weights and visibility. Avoid expensive visibility calculations.

2) Sequential Learning Scheme: Introduce a continual learning paradigm tailored for sequential data to enable long sequences without revisiting previous data. Use experience replay to retain performance on old data when updating networks.

3) Density Field Compression: Compress similar structures across frames in the density field for compact storage, using SVD.

Main Contributions:

- A video-based radiance field representation with separate geometry and appearance to achieve quality results with compact storage for dynamic scenes

- A novel image-based rendering pipeline that predicts radiance directly from multi-view videos and visibility blending 

- A continual learning scheme for sequential data that supports long-duration rendering without catastrophic forgetting

The method is demonstrated to enable long sequence reconstruction, achieve state-of-the-art quality, and compress dynamic scenes effectively.
