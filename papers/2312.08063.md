# [Estimation of Concept Explanations Should be Uncertainty Aware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08063)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Uncertainty-Aware Concept Explanations (U-ACE) for generating more reliable concept-based explanations of machine learning models. Concept explanations aim to interpret a model by estimating the importance of human-understandable concepts. The authors observe that existing methods for estimating concept explanations can be unstable due to high variance, especially when concepts are missing or irrelevant. To address this, U-ACE incorporates Bayesian uncertainty modeling into the concept importance estimation. Specifically, U-ACE models aleatoric uncertainty arising from noisy concept activations as well as epistemic uncertainty arising from missing or hard-to-recognize concepts. Through theoretical analysis, the authors show U-ACE is more robust to over-complete and under-complete concept sets compared to standard methods. Empirically, U-ACE generates higher quality explanations on both synthetic and real-world image datasets based on distance from a simple linear explanation method using ground truth annotations. The improved reliability and label-efficiency of U-ACE concept explanations could make them valuable for tasks like model debugging and scientific discovery.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware Bayesian method called U-ACE for estimating concept explanations that improves their reliability by modeling the uncertainty in concept activations predicted from the representation layer of a model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Uncertainty-Aware Concept Explanations (U-ACE) for estimating concept-based explanations of machine learning models. Specifically:

- The paper motivates the need for modeling uncertainty when estimating concept explanations, in order to improve their reliability. Existing methods can produce unstable or unreliable explanations due to high variance.

- The U-ACE method incorporates Bayesian estimation to model uncertainty in the concept activation scores predicted from the model. This helps address variance issues and improve explanation stability.

- Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the paper demonstrates that the U-ACE method generates more reliable concept explanations compared to prior methods, while also being label-efficient and faithful to the model.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing a new uncertainty-aware approach to concept explanations that improves their reliability, as demonstrated through both theory and empirical evaluations. The method also avoids the need for labeled concept data through use of a pretrained multimodal model.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Concept explanations - Explaining model predictions using human-understandable concepts
- Unreliability - Existing concept explanation methods can be unreliable or sensitive to choices like concept set and dataset
- Uncertainty modeling - The paper argues for modeling uncertainty in concept activations and explanations to improve reliability 
- Bayesian estimation - The proposed method, U-ACE, takes a Bayesian approach to estimate concept explanations in an uncertainty-aware manner
- Label efficiency - Using pretrained multi-modal models like CLIP to specify concepts instead of labeled concept datasets
- Reliability - The paper aims to show U-ACE produces more reliable concept explanations through theoretical and empirical analysis

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware Bayesian estimation method called U-ACE. How exactly does modeling uncertainty in concept activations help improve the reliability of concept explanations?

2. Proposition 1 provides a closed-form expression to estimate the mean and variance of concept activations. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this result. What assumptions are made?

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Concept explanations are an interpretable method to explain model predictions using human-understandable concepts. They work by estimating the importance of concepts for a model's predictions. However, existing concept explanation methods are known to be unreliable as the estimated explanations vary significantly with choices like the probe dataset or concept set used. This unreliability is because current methods do not properly account for the uncertainty present in the concept importance estimation process.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new concept explanation method called Uncertainty-Aware Concept Explanations (U-ACE) that models uncertainty to improve reliability. U-ACE works in two main steps:

1. Estimate concept activations from the model's internal representations for each input, along with error bounds that capture the uncertainty. This is done in a data-efficient way using a pre-trained multimodal model like CLIP.

2. Aggregate activations into a model explanation by fitting a Bayesian linear model that maps activations to model outputs. The noise modeled in step 1 is used to define an uncertainty-aware prior over the linear weights to make the explanations robust to uncertainty.

Main Contributions:

- Identify unreliability of prior concept explanation methods as arising from not modeling uncertainty 

- Propose U-ACE, a new uncertainty-aware Bayesian approach to concept explanations

- Theoretical analysis showing U-ACE explanations are more reliable compared to standard methods

- Empirical evaluation on 2 synthetic and 2 real-world datasets demonstrating improved reliability and label-efficiency of U-ACE

In summary, the paper makes concept explanations more reliable by explicitly accounting for uncertainty, while still retaining their interpretability and without needing extra labeled data. The proposed U-ACE method is shown to outperform prior concept explanation techniques.
