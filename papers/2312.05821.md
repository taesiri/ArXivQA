# [ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have massive memory and computation requirements, limiting their adoption. Existing compression techniques like weight quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation rely heavily on fine-tuning, which is expensive for LLMs.  
- Low-rank decomposition is promising for LLM compression but straightforward application of existing methods fails. Two key challenges are identified:
  1) Sensitivity to weight variations - small changes in weights can cause large shifts in activations due to outliers.
  2) Varying sensitivity among layers - some layers are more sensitive to compression than others.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose two techniques - Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD) and Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS):

1) ASVD: 
- Scales weight matrix columns based on activation distribution to handle outliers.
- Decomposes scaled weight matrix to retain top singular values and vectors.
- Reconstructs weight matrix using truncated decomposition and inverse scaling.  

2) STRS:
- Evaluates layer-wise sensitivity using perplexity changes from truncated SVD on calibration data. 
- Layers vary in sensitivity - MLP layers are more sensitive than MHA layers.
- Uses binary search to find optimal truncation ranks per layer based on sensitivity.

- ASVD handles activation outliers for accuracy.
- STRS adapts to varying layer sensitivity for efficiency.

Contributions:
- First work on low-rank decomposition for efficient LLM compression without retraining.
- ASVD handles activation outliers by scaling weights based on distributions. 
- STRS determines optimal truncation ranks by assessing layer sensitivities.
- Experiments show 10-20% compression on LLamas with minimal accuracy loss.
- ASVD compatible as plug-and-play technique with LLM quantization methods.

In summary, the paper introduces two novel techniques to enable low-rank decomposition for efficient LLM compression without expensive retraining. ASVD and STRS address key challenges around activations and layer sensitivity respectively.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD) to compress large language models by decomposing weight matrices and handling activation outliers and layer sensitivity differences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD) to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically:

- ASVD incorporates the distribution of activations into the decomposition process to handle activation outliers more effectively. It scales the weight matrix columns based on activation patterns to improve decomposition accuracy.

- The paper also proposes a Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) method to address the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers to decomposition. STRS determines a suitable rank for optimal decomposition of each layer through an efficient evaluation process.

- Experiments show ASVD can compress LLMs by 10-20% without losing reasoning capacity, in a training-free manner. It also shows compatibility with weight quantization methods.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient, training-free decomposition approach tailored for compressing LLMs by handling activation outliers and layer sensitivity, with demonstrated compression performance and flexibility. The method aims to facilitate wider adoption of large models across different computing environments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD): The proposed training-free compression approach that takes into account activation patterns to improve decomposition accuracy.

- Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS): The proposed method to determine optimal truncation ranks for each layer based on an analysis of their sensitivity to decomposition. 

- Low-rank decomposition: The general technique of approximating weight matrices as low-rank matrices to reduce model size.

- Training-free compression: The paradigm of compressing models without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

- Large Language Models (LLMs): The class of large transformer-based language models that the techniques are applied to, such as LLaMA.

- Activation outliers: The outlier values in activations that need special handling during decomposition.

- Layer sensitivity: The varying resilience of different layers to compression, requiring tailored approaches. 

- Perplexity: The key metric used to evaluate model performance after compression.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed ASVD and STRS methods, the concept of low-rank decomposition, the training-free compression paradigm, LLMs, issues like activation outliers and layer sensitivity, and perplexity as an evaluation metric.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions managing activation outliers as a key challenge in decomposing LLMs. Can you expand on why these outliers pose such difficulty and how specifically ASVD handles this issue through its channel-wise scaling matrix?

2. When exploring methods to determine the scaling matrix S, the paper evaluates absolute mean value and absolute max value of input activations. What is the rationale behind choosing these specific metrics and what are some other potentially effective ways to quantify activation significance? 

3. The paper argues ASVD can help address varying sensitivity of different layers to decomposition. Can you walk through how the layer-wise truncation rank search process works in detail and why a binary search approach is well-suited?

4. How exactly does ASVD leverage properties of SVD for low-rank matrix approximation? What is the significance of the truncation error formula presented and how does ASVD optimization connect back to this theoretical principle?

5. The absorption of singular values is noted to provide benefits for weight quantization. Can you expand on the quantization challenges this absorption aims to alleviate and why the proposed fusion technique is superior to alternatives?

6. In analyzing the decomposed networks, we see MLP layers are compressed less than MHA layers. What explanations does the paper offer for this discrepancy and what are your thoughts on potential other factors at play?

7. One interesting finding is higher compression ratios for initial layers. What hypotheses might explain this observation and how could we further analyze the data to validate the reasoning? 

8. How compatible is ASVD with various训练 quantization methods beyond simple RTN and NF4 evaluated? Are there certain advanced quantization techniques you believe could integrate especially effectively?

9. The paper compares with a Fisher information weighted SVD technique. What specifically does this method do differently and why does ASVD still outperform it? Can you critique any limitations of this comparison?

10. If you were to advance the ASVD approach even further, what key next steps would you prioritize investigating and why? What existing gaps could be addressed by future work?
