# [Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation: Let's Talk About The Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08357)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can self-supervised monocular depth estimation be made more robust to different weather conditions and times of day?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods rely too heavily on sunny, clear weather training data and thus do not generalize well to other conditions like rain, fog, nighttime, etc.

2) Data augmentations like weather effects, nighttime, and image corruptions can help make self-supervised monocular depth more robust. However, naively applying these tends to hurt performance. 

3) A novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss and consistent training framework can allow data augmentations to improve robustness without sacrificing performance on clear, sunny data.

So in summary, the main research question is how to improve generalizability and robustness of self-supervised monocular depth to different weather conditions and times of day. The key hypothesis is that a certain training framework with bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss can allow data augmentations to help achieve this goal without hurting original performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss function that enforces consistency between depth maps estimated from original and augmented images. This allows the original depth maps to guide the learning for augmented images and vice versa. 

- Putting forward a set of recommendations/components for a robust data augmentation framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, including using original images for warping, training on original+augmented image pairs, and pseudo-supervision for pose estimation.

- Introducing a variety of weather and time related data augmentations (rain, fog, night etc.) using graphics/GANs to make the model more robust to different environments.

- Adding positional augmentations like vertical cropping and tiling to reduce the network's reliance on naive cues like vertical position.

- Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed method achieves similar or better performance on KITTI while significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art on challenging weather datasets.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be developing an augmentation scheme and associated training methodology to make self-supervised monocular depth estimation more robust to different adverse weather conditions and environments, without sacrificing performance on normal sunny conditions. The bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss plays a key role in enabling effective learning from augmented data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised monocular depth estimation method that uses a novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss and carefully constructed data augmentations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in adverse weather conditions while maintaining accuracy in normal conditions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key ways this research compares to other work in monocular depth estimation:

- The focus on improving robustness to adverse weather conditions sets it apart from much prior work that assumes sunny, clear conditions. Many previous methods perform well on datasets like KITTI but struggle when tested on foggy, rainy, or nighttime data. This paper specifically tackles that weakness.

- The use of extensive data augmentation via generative models and physics-based rendering to create a variety of weather effects is more thorough than what has typically been done before. The authors construct a diverse training set to improve generalizability.

- The proposed bidirectional pseudo-supervision loss function is a novel way to leverage unlabeled augmented data. The consistency between unaugmented and augmented depth maps provides supervision without ground truth depth labels. 

- The combination of algorithmic contributions - the pseudo-supervision loss, semi-augmented warping, training image pairs - seems more comprehensive than most prior work at adapting self-supervised monocular methods to handle data augmentations well. 

- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on KITTI while significantly advancing robustness on challenging weather datasets relative to prior art. The framework consistently improves generalization ability.

- The approach is architecture agnostic and shows gains both with a standard CNN backbone and the Monodepth Transformer architecture, demonstrating wider applicability.

Overall, the paper tackles a known weakness in monocular depth estimation through an extensive data augmentation pipeline and novel training methodology. The gains in out-of-domain generalization substantially advance the state of the art in handling diverse real-world conditions.
