# [Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation: Let's Talk About The Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08357)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can self-supervised monocular depth estimation be made more robust to different weather conditions and times of day?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods rely too heavily on sunny, clear weather training data and thus do not generalize well to other conditions like rain, fog, nighttime, etc.

2) Data augmentations like weather effects, nighttime, and image corruptions can help make self-supervised monocular depth more robust. However, naively applying these tends to hurt performance. 

3) A novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss and consistent training framework can allow data augmentations to improve robustness without sacrificing performance on clear, sunny data.

So in summary, the main research question is how to improve generalizability and robustness of self-supervised monocular depth to different weather conditions and times of day. The key hypothesis is that a certain training framework with bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss can allow data augmentations to help achieve this goal without hurting original performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss function that enforces consistency between depth maps estimated from original and augmented images. This allows the original depth maps to guide the learning for augmented images and vice versa. 

- Putting forward a set of recommendations/components for a robust data augmentation framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, including using original images for warping, training on original+augmented image pairs, and pseudo-supervision for pose estimation.

- Introducing a variety of weather and time related data augmentations (rain, fog, night etc.) using graphics/GANs to make the model more robust to different environments.

- Adding positional augmentations like vertical cropping and tiling to reduce the network's reliance on naive cues like vertical position.

- Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed method achieves similar or better performance on KITTI while significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art on challenging weather datasets.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be developing an augmentation scheme and associated training methodology to make self-supervised monocular depth estimation more robust to different adverse weather conditions and environments, without sacrificing performance on normal sunny conditions. The bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss plays a key role in enabling effective learning from augmented data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised monocular depth estimation method that uses a novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss and carefully constructed data augmentations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in adverse weather conditions while maintaining accuracy in normal conditions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key ways this research compares to other work in monocular depth estimation:

- The focus on improving robustness to adverse weather conditions sets it apart from much prior work that assumes sunny, clear conditions. Many previous methods perform well on datasets like KITTI but struggle when tested on foggy, rainy, or nighttime data. This paper specifically tackles that weakness.

- The use of extensive data augmentation via generative models and physics-based rendering to create a variety of weather effects is more thorough than what has typically been done before. The authors construct a diverse training set to improve generalizability.

- The proposed bidirectional pseudo-supervision loss function is a novel way to leverage unlabeled augmented data. The consistency between unaugmented and augmented depth maps provides supervision without ground truth depth labels. 

- The combination of algorithmic contributions - the pseudo-supervision loss, semi-augmented warping, training image pairs - seems more comprehensive than most prior work at adapting self-supervised monocular methods to handle data augmentations well. 

- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on KITTI while significantly advancing robustness on challenging weather datasets relative to prior art. The framework consistently improves generalization ability.

- The approach is architecture agnostic and shows gains both with a standard CNN backbone and the Monodepth Transformer architecture, demonstrating wider applicability.

Overall, the paper tackles a known weakness in monocular depth estimation through an extensive data augmentation pipeline and novel training methodology. The gains in out-of-domain generalization substantially advance the state of the art in handling diverse real-world conditions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reading the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving nighttime depth estimation, especially for detecting vehicles. The paper notes current methods rely on shadow cues under vehicles which don't work well at night. Generating more realistic nighttime training data without these shadow cues could help.

- Handling more extreme distance changes and vertical obstacles like cliffs better. The paper notes their positional augmentations help reduce reliance on naive depth cues but limitations still exist. More advanced augmentations or network modifications may help here.

- Using more sophisticated generative models to create training data with realistic rain/wetness effects like reflections. This could improve issues like lampposts being mistaken for trees.

- Training on more diverse datasets beyond just KITTI to reduce overfitting, like the issues with mistakenly recognizing lampposts as trees due to prevalence of trees in KITTI.

- Exploring modifications to handle dynamic/moving objects and relax the rigid scene assumption made by current self-supervised monocular depth methods. This could have benefits for real-world applications.

- Leveraging estimated object motions, like from other vehicles, to improve depth understanding and not just treat them as moving objects to be masked out.

So in summary, key future directions relate to improving robustness across different environments and conditions, handling dynamic scenes better, using more and better training data, and integrating depth with other scene understanding tasks like motion estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method called Robust-Depth for improving the robustness of self-supervised monocular depth estimation under challenging weather conditions and image degradations. Current state-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation methods rely on sunny weather training data and struggle when tested on fog, rain, nighttime scenes etc. The key ideas proposed are: 1) A novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss that enforces consistency between the depth maps of original and augmented images. 2) A training scheme that always trains on original and augmented image pairs to prevent catastrophic forgetting. 3) Semi-augmented warping that uses original images for warping to handle inconsistency of augmented images. 4) Carefully designed weather/time/degradation augmentations like rain, fog, night etc combined with positional augmentations like vertical cropping to remove reliance on simplistic cues. Experiments show the method achieves similar performance as state-of-the-art on sunny data but significantly outperforms on challenging weather datasets like Foggy Cityscapes and Nuscenes Night without requiring any labels. Overall the method provides a robust framework to handle diverse real-world conditions for self-supervised monocular depth estimation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Robust-Depth for improving the robustness of self-supervised monocular depth estimation to adverse weather conditions and other image corruptions. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on sunny weather training data like KITTI and fail to generalize to fog, rain, snow etc. The core idea is to train the model on a diverse set of weather augmentations but also introduce a novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss function. This loss enforces consistency between the depth maps predicted on augmented and unaugmented image pairs. For example, the depth predicted on a rainy image can be used to supervise the training for the original sunny image. This brings some of the benefits of supervised learning without requiring labels. 

The paper also makes recommendations for a robust data augmentation scheme including vertical cropping, tiling, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on KITTI while significantly improving generalizability. The method is evaluated on challenging weather datasets like Foggy Cityscapes and NuScenes Night which contain fog, rain and nighttime images. Both qualitative and quantitative results show the superiority of Robust-Depth over existing techniques in handling weather corruptions. The modular framework could be applied to other self-supervised pixel-prediction tasks to improve robustness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised monocular depth estimation method that is robust to different weather conditions and times of day. The key idea is to use a combination of computer graphics and generative models to augment existing sunny weather data with simulations of rain, fog, nighttime etc. A novel bi-directional pseudo-supervision loss is introduced which exploits the alignment between unaugmented and augmented data pairs to provide hints for the depth and pose networks. Specifically, depth maps from unaugmented images are used as soft targets to supervise the augmented depth predictions and vice versa. This brings back some benefits of supervised learning without requiring manual labels. The method also makes recommendations for creating a robust data augmentation framework like using unaugmented images for warping, training on image pairs, and applying vertical/tiling cropping to avoid over-reliance on simplistic cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on KITTI while significantly improving generalization to challenging weather datasets like Foggy Cityscapes and NuScenes Night.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem it is trying to address is the limited robustness and generalizability of current self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods to different weather conditions and times of day. 

Specifically, the paper notes that existing self-supervised depth methods rely heavily on training data consisting of clear, sunny daytime images, like those in the KITTI dataset. However, this assumption of sunny weather does not hold true in many real-world settings and limits the applicability of these methods. For example, the paper points out that in the UK, there were 149 rainy days in 2021.

To overcome this limitation, the paper puts forward a method to augment existing sunny daytime data with realistic simulations of adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, snow etc. as well as variations in lighting to represent nighttime, dawn and dusk scenes. The main goal is to make self-supervised monocular depth estimation more robust so the methods can generalize well to all weather conditions and times of day, not just sunny daytime scenes.

In summary, the key problem is the limited robustness of current self-supervised monocular depth techniques, and the main question is how to augment existing sunny daytime data to cover a wider variety of weather conditions and illumination so these methods can generalize better to real-world settings.
