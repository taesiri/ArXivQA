# [EdgeSAM: Prompt-In-the-Loop Distillation for On-Device Deployment of SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06660)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents EdgeSAM, a highly efficient variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) optimized for real-time interactive segmentation on edge devices like smartphones. The authors employ knowledge distillation to transfer capabilities from the original computationally-intensive SAM to a lightweight CNN-based student model. They find that standard encoder distillation fails to fully capture SAM's knowledge and propose a novel prompt-in-the-loop strategy, actively sampling prompts during training to provide targeted supervision. This enhances the student network's focus, interpretation, and response to prompts. To handle dataset biases, the authors incorporate a lightweight region proposal network module to embed dataset-specific granularity preferences. Experiments demonstrate EdgeSAM's superior efficiency, achieving over 30 FPS on mobile devices - a 40x speedup over SAM - with performance surpassing SAM in some cases. EdgeSAM also outperforms MobileSAM in accuracy while operating 14x faster on smartphones. This real-time on-device performance could enable diverse video and interactive applications. Key innovations include prompt-based distillation, handling biases in automated vs interactive segmentation, exploring accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs for edge deployment, and pushing the boundaries of on-device deep learning.
