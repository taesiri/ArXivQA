# [T-DEED: Temporal-Discriminability Enhancer Encoder-Decoder for Precise   Event Spotting in Sports Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos. PES involves accurately localizing and classifying events in untrimmed videos, represented as single keyframes. The main challenges faced in this task include: (1) The need for discriminative representations to differentiate between spatially similar frames, (2) High output temporal resolution to maintain precision, and (3) Capturing varying temporal contexts for events with different dynamics.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes T-DEED, a Temporal-Discriminability Enhancer Encoder-Decoder model. The key components are:

(1) Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Processes features at multiple temporal scales in the encoder to capture different event contexts. Restores original resolution in the decoder to regain precision.

(2) SGP Layers: Replace self-attention in transformers to enhance token discriminability within sequences, helping distinguish similar frames.

(3) SGP-Mixer Layer: Novel layer to effectively aggregate multi-scale features from encoder-decoder skip connections while boosting token discriminability.

Main Contributions:

(1) Integration of residual connections into SGP layer to support multi-scale feature mixing in the skip connections of the encoder-decoder architecture.  

(2) Introduction of SGP-Mixer module to aggregate information from different temporal scales while sharing core principles of SGP to improve token discriminability.

(3) Extensive ablation studies demonstrating advantages of the proposed techniques.

(4) State-of-the-art results on Figure Skating and FineDiving datasets, outperforming prior art by up to +4.83 mAP.
