# [Target Score Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Denoising score matching (DSM) is commonly used to estimate the score (gradient of the log density) of a "noised" distribution by minimizing a regression loss. However, DSM performs poorly at low noise levels.  

- This is an issue in applications like physical sciences and Monte Carlo sampling where the score of the original "clean" distribution is known. Intuitively, estimating the score of a slightly noised version should be easier with access to the clean score.

- But standard score identities and losses like DSM fail to leverage knowledge of the clean score and exhibit exploding variance at low noise.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a Target Score Identity (TSI) which relies on the clean score. This provides a Monte Carlo estimator of the noised score with lower variance.

- They also propose a Target Score Matching (TSM) loss for parametric score estimation that leverages the clean score. 

- TSI and TSM do not require knowledge of the derivative or score of the noise distribution, unlike DSM.

- The method is extended to non-additive noise using change of variables. Other extensions to Lie groups, interpolation between distributions, and combinations with DSM are also provided.

Contributions:
- Identify issues with standard score estimation at low noise levels and propose TSI and TSM to address this.

- Provide a simple identity and loss to leverage access to clean scores in applicable settings.

- Demonstrate reduced variance theoretically and on analytic/trained score model experiments.

- Extend the framework beyond the basic additive Gaussian noise setting.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel score identity and matching loss to address deficiencies of standard methods when a clean score is available. This is useful in many application settings.
