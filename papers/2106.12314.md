# CharacterChat: Supporting the Creation of Fictional Characters through   Conversation and Progressive Manifestation with a Chatbot

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:"How might a conversation-based tool -- a chatbot -- support writers in creating fictional characters?"The authors state this research question explicitly in the introduction section:"Thus, we investigate how we might utilise this “match” (i.e. conversation as both a UI paradigm and creative expression), with the following research question:How might a conversation-based tool -- a chatbot -- support writers in creating fictional characters?"So the key research question is focused on exploring how a conversational chatbot could be designed as a creativity support tool to help writers with the process of creating fictional characters. The rest of the paper then presents the authors' work towards addressing this question through an iterative user-centered design process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper presents CharacterChat, a chatbot system that supports writers in creating fictional characters through a process the authors call "Progressive Manifestation." CharacterChat allows writers to progressively turn the chatbot into a fictional character of their own design through conversation. 2. The paper proposes and evaluates two key modes that CharacterChat uses to support character creation:- Guided Conversation Mode: The chatbot provides rule-based prompts to help the writer define various attributes of the character, such as name, motivations, fears, etc. It can also suggest potential values for those attributes using a concept network. - Open Conversation Mode: The writer can have free-form conversational exchanges with the chatbot to further explore the character. The chatbot utilizes a neural language model that takes into account the attributes defined so far.3. Through an iterative, user-centered design process, the authors evaluated CharacterChat with writers in two qualitative user studies (N=7 and N=8). The studies provided insights into the usefulness of the tool, especially for early ideation stages of character creation, as well as limitations and areas for improvement.4. The paper reflects on the concept of using conversational AI as both a co-creative tool to support human creativity, and as a representation of the creative outcome itself. This dual role provides a new perspective in human-AI co-creativity.In summary, the core contribution is the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel conversational creativity support tool for fictional character creation. The paper provides both a specific system concept as well as broader insights into this application area at the intersection of AI, HCI and creative writing.
