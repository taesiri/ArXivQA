# [CharacterChat: Supporting the Creation of Fictional Characters through   Conversation and Progressive Manifestation with a Chatbot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12314)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

"How might a conversation-based tool -- a chatbot -- support writers in creating fictional characters?"

The authors state this research question explicitly in the introduction section:

"Thus, we investigate how we might utilise this “match” (i.e. conversation as both a UI paradigm and creative expression), with the following research question:
How might a conversation-based tool -- a chatbot -- support writers in creating fictional characters?"

So the key research question is focused on exploring how a conversational chatbot could be designed as a creativity support tool to help writers with the process of creating fictional characters. The rest of the paper then presents the authors' work towards addressing this question through an iterative user-centered design process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper presents CharacterChat, a chatbot system that supports writers in creating fictional characters through a process the authors call "Progressive Manifestation." CharacterChat allows writers to progressively turn the chatbot into a fictional character of their own design through conversation. 

2. The paper proposes and evaluates two key modes that CharacterChat uses to support character creation:

- Guided Conversation Mode: The chatbot provides rule-based prompts to help the writer define various attributes of the character, such as name, motivations, fears, etc. It can also suggest potential values for those attributes using a concept network. 

- Open Conversation Mode: The writer can have free-form conversational exchanges with the chatbot to further explore the character. The chatbot utilizes a neural language model that takes into account the attributes defined so far.

3. Through an iterative, user-centered design process, the authors evaluated CharacterChat with writers in two qualitative user studies (N=7 and N=8). The studies provided insights into the usefulness of the tool, especially for early ideation stages of character creation, as well as limitations and areas for improvement.

4. The paper reflects on the concept of using conversational AI as both a co-creative tool to support human creativity, and as a representation of the creative outcome itself. This dual role provides a new perspective in human-AI co-creativity.

In summary, the core contribution is the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel conversational creativity support tool for fictional character creation. The paper provides both a specific system concept as well as broader insights into this application area at the intersection of AI, HCI and creative writing.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper presents a chatbot system called CharacterChat that helps writers create fictional characters by having conversational interactions where the user shapes the chatbot into a character by defining attributes and exploring its "personality" through open dialogue.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper comparing to other research in the field of using AI/chatbots to support creative writing:

- The core idea of using a conversational interface (chatbot) to help writers create fictional characters seems relatively novel compared to other creative writing tools. Most prior systems focus on story/plot generation, tracking character info, visualizing stories, etc. rather than ideation of new characters.

- The iterative user-centered design process aligns with best practices in HCI research. The combination of an initial survey, two qualitative user studies, analysis of dialogue logs, and use of an established questionnaire (CSI) provides a rigorous evaluation methodology.

- The concept of "progressive manifestation" via conversation is unique. Prior systems like Google's BanterBot also prompt writers to describe characters, but don't progressively turn the chatbot itself into the character through the conversation.

- Integrating both rule-based prompts and open-ended neural text generation provides complementary modes of ideation support. This mixed-initiative approach balances guided structure with more freeform exploration.

- The sample sizes are fairly small (7 and 8 participants) compared to some quantitative HCI studies, but reasonable for an initial qualitative evaluation, especially given the detail gathered via interviews, think aloud, etc.

- There is a focus on reflective discussion and articulating lessons learned for designing creativity support tools and conversational UIs. This helps situate the specific prototype in a broader context.

Overall, the progressive manifestation idea, balance of guided and open-ended conversation, and qualitative insights seem like unique contributions compared to prior creative writing tools and chatbots. The paper provides a solid foundation for future work to build on.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the conversational and text generation capabilities of the chatbot, especially to better reflect defined character attributes and achieve a more natural dialogue style. The authors suggest advances in conditional language modeling could help achieve this.

- Exploring use by professional writers over longer periods to go beyond novelty effects and gain deeper insights into integration with individual writing processes.

- Incorporating capabilities to handle existing character data, such as loading in attributes previously defined elsewhere. 

- Evaluating the concept at later stages of the character creation process and for further developing characters, not just initial ideation.

- Exploring different combinations of conversational UI with other UI elements (e.g. character sheets) for a flexible hybrid tool.

- Applying the concept of progressive manifestation to other creative domains beyond character creation.

- Comparing the chatbot approach to more traditional character sheet interfaces in future studies. 

- Testing the system with larger sample sizes.

- Releasing the system online for longer-term in-the-wild studies.

In summary, the main suggested future work relates to improving the core AI/chatbot capabilities, studying use by professional writers over longer timespans, supporting later stages of character creation, exploring UI variations, and applying the core concept to other creative domains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents CharacterChat, a chatbot concept and tool that supports writers in creating fictional characters. The core idea is "progressive manifestation", where the writer turns the chatbot into a character by conversing with it. The tool has two modes - guided prompts suggest attributes to define the character, drawing values from a concept network; open conversation lets the writer freely chat with the bot to explore the character. The authors developed CharacterChat through a user-centered design process, conducting a survey on character creation and two qualitative user studies with writers (N=7 and N=8). Results indicate the tool helps inspire ideas, especially in early stages of character creation, but is limited by the chatbot's conversational capabilities. Key lessons learned relate to making mode switches explicit, the benefits of guided prompts despite limiting conversatonal impression, and pragmatic use of interaction to address text generation limitations. Overall, the tool represents a novel application of conversational interfaces and co-creative AI for creativity support.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents CharacterChat, a chatbot system that supports writers in creating fictional characters. The system allows writers to converse with the chatbot and progressively "shape" it into a character by defining attributes about the character's personality, background, appearance, etc. There are two main modes: 1) Guided prompts where the chatbot suggests attributes for the writer to define (e.g. "What is my biggest fear?"). It can also suggest values for attributes based on a concept graph. 2) Open conversation where the writer can explore the character through free dialogue, with the chatbot generating responses conditioned on the attributes defined so far. 

The authors evaluated CharacterChat through an iterative user-centered design process. First they conducted a survey of 30 writers to inform the design. Then they built a prototype and evaluated it in a qualitative user study with 7 writers. Based on feedback, they improved the UI and chatbot capabilities. A second study with 8 writers evaluated this improved version. Overall, the studies showed that the system helps writers get inspiration and ideas, especially in early stages of character creation. The guided prompts and concept graph helped define attributes, while the open conversation provided a way to explore the character. Limitations were mainly due to current conversational capabilities. The authors conclude with takeaways for designing creativity support tools using conversational interfaces.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The authors developed a chatbot called CharacterChat to support writers in creating fictional characters, using an iterative user-centered design process. They first conducted an online survey with 30 writers to gain insights into character creation processes and supplement attributes from the literature. Then they implemented a prototype with two conversation modes: guided prompts to define character attributes, and open-ended chat to explore the character's personality. They evaluated this prototype in a qualitative study with 7 writers, using observation, interviews, questionnaires, and log analysis. Based on this feedback, they improved the UI and chatbot capabilities. They then evaluated the revised prototype in a second qualitative study with 8 new writers, using the same methods. The two user studies provided insights into the usefulness of the tool for early stages of character creation, and limitations due to current chatbot capabilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key question the paper is addressing is:

"How might a conversation-based tool -- a chatbot -- support writers in creating fictional characters?"

The authors motivate this question by pointing out that fictional characters are central to creative narrative work, but creating compelling, "round" characters is challenging. They note that prior tools for writers focus more on tracking/managing existing characters rather than supporting the initial creative process of inventing new characters. 

The authors explore using a conversational interface as a potential way to support character creation, given that conversation is both a common UI paradigm (chatbots) as well as an expressive medium used in stories to reveal character personality and inner life. 

So in summary, the core question is how to design a chatbot tool to support the creative process of inventing and developing fictional characters.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:
