# [Design and Visual Servoing Control of a Hybrid Dual-Segment Flexible   Neurosurgical Robot for Intraventricular Biopsy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rigid neuroendoscopes have limited maneuverability to access tumors in complex brain anatomy. Fixed viewing angles also complicate biopsy of difficult-to-reach tumors. 
- Flexible robots can enhance endoscope dexterity but have challenges with lower image resolution, poor accessibility with single flexible segments, and procedural complexities combining rigid and flexible endoscopes.
- Precise control of flexible robots in confined intracranial spaces is also challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel hybrid dual-segment flexible neurosurgical robot called MicroNeuro is proposed. It can pass through a single burr hole and provides dexterous manipulation for biopsy.
- The robot has an inner endoscope and outer sheath, both with multiple bendable segments. This allows two steering modes for enhanced maneuverability.
- A vision-based control strategy is used, with a visual servoing controller designed to deal with uncertainties. 
- An image-based visual servoing method with online Jacobian matrix estimation is implemented to improve motion accuracy.
- A model predictive control (MPC) scheme with constraints is added to improve robustness against disturbances and allow adaptive tracking of moving targets.

Main Contributions:
- Design of a cable-driven flexible dual-segment robot for neuroendoscopy to provide sufficient intraventricular dexterity through one burr hole.
- Development of a visual model predictive control framework that incorporates online Jacobian estimation to enhance the precision and robustness of visual servoing for the flexible robot.
- Experimental validations showing precise tracking of static and moving targets, trajectory following ability, and maintenance of target focusing under external disturbances from simulator biopsy gripper insertion.
- Demonstrated feasibility for the robot and control method to potentially assist neurosurgeons in safely and effectively accessing tumors in deep brain anatomy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel dual-segment flexible neurosurgical robot and an image-based visual servoing control method with model predictive control to enhance motion accuracy and adaptability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A novel dual-segment flexible robotic endoscope called MicroNeuro is proposed, which is designed specifically for intraventricular neurosurgery. It can pass through a single burr hole and provides sufficient dexterity to perform biopsies in the narrow ventricles.

2) A visual model predictive control (MPC) framework with online Jacobian estimation is proposed to enhance the robustness and precision of visual servoing control for the flexible robot. The MPC utilizes constraints to ensure the robot motions and states remain within desired safe bounds, which is important for neurosurgical applications.

So in summary, the main contributions are the design of a novel flexible neurosurgical robot, and a control framework to enable precise constrained visual servoing of this robot.

The paper introduces a novel flexible neurosurgical robot called MicroNeuro for performing intraventricular biopsies. It has a hybrid dual-segment design to provide dexterity inside the brain. The control method uses image-based visual servoing with online estimation of the robot's Jacobian matrix. It also employs model predictive control with constraints to improve motion accuracy and resist disturbances. Experiments involve tracking static and dynamic targets as well as performing biopsy in a brain phantom. Key performance measures are the tracking error compared to a defined maximum permissible error. Potential applications are biopsying tumors in the pineal region deep inside the brain through a single burr hole.
