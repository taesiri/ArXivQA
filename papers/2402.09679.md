# [Design and Visual Servoing Control of a Hybrid Dual-Segment Flexible   Neurosurgical Robot for Intraventricular Biopsy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rigid neuroendoscopes have limited maneuverability to access tumors in complex brain anatomy. Fixed viewing angles also complicate biopsy of difficult-to-reach tumors. 
- Flexible robots can enhance endoscope dexterity but have challenges with lower image resolution, poor accessibility with single flexible segments, and procedural complexities combining rigid and flexible endoscopes.
- Precise control of flexible robots in confined intracranial spaces is also challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel hybrid dual-segment flexible neurosurgical robot called MicroNeuro is proposed. It can pass through a single burr hole and provides dexterous manipulation for biopsy.
- The robot has an inner endoscope and outer sheath, both with multiple bendable segments. This allows two steering modes for enhanced maneuverability.
- A vision-based control strategy is used, with a visual servoing controller designed to deal with uncertainties. 
- An image-based visual servoing method with online Jacobian matrix estimation is implemented to improve motion accuracy.
- A model predictive control (MPC) scheme with constraints is added to improve robustness against disturbances and allow adaptive tracking of moving targets.

Main Contributions:
- Design of a cable-driven flexible dual-segment robot for neuroendoscopy to provide sufficient intraventricular dexterity through one burr hole.
- Development of a visual model predictive control framework that incorporates online Jacobian estimation to enhance the precision and robustness of visual servoing for the flexible robot.
- Experimental validations showing precise tracking of static and moving targets, trajectory following ability, and maintenance of target focusing under external disturbances from simulator biopsy gripper insertion.
- Demonstrated feasibility for the robot and control method to potentially assist neurosurgeons in safely and effectively accessing tumors in deep brain anatomy.
