# [GRASP: GRAph-Structured Pyramidal Whole Slide Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying and subtyping whole slide images (WSIs) in digital pathology is challenging due to the gigapixel size of the images and weak labels provided only at the slide level. 
- Existing methods using multiple instance learning (MIL) focus only on a single magnification level and do not capture inter- and intra-magnification information in the WSIs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GRASP, a novel graph-structured multi-magnification framework to represent and classify WSIs. 
- GRASP represents a WSI as a hierarchical graph with nodes as image patches from different magnifications (5x, 10x, 20x) connected based on their multi-magnification relationships.
- It uses a 3-layer graph convolutional network architecture designed to allow information propagation across the entire graph to capture inter- and intra-magnification interactions.
- A key novelty is the inter-magnification convergence instead of traditional pooling, which allows distillation of information within and across magnifications into a compact graph-level representation for classification.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the first interpretable, graph-structured multi-magnification model (GRASP) for hierarchical representation and classification of WSIs in digital pathology.
- Graph modeling and convergence approach to effectively aggregate inter- and intra-magnification information from WSIs.  
- State-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks, outperforming existing methods like MIL-based and graph-based models.
- Detailed analysis and evidence confirming GRASP dynamically leverages multi-magnification information mimicking pathologists.
- Strong theoretical analysis on information propagation in GRASP along with empirical studies demonstrating its reliability across different hyper-parameters.
