# [ChatGPT Application In Summarizing An Evolution Of Deep Learning   Techniques In Imaging: A Qualitative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores using ChatGPT to generate summaries of scientific manuscripts and evaluates the quality of these summaries via a qualitative study involving interviews with authors. 

Methodology
- Selected 7 scientific articles with an evolution of deep learning techniques theme
- Used ChatGPT to generate a 1-page summary for each paper
- Interviewed 6 co-authors with 5 questions to assess summary quality on aspects like key information, objectives, details, technical depth, overall satisfaction

Results
- Average scores ranged from 3.43 to 4.73 out of 5 across articles
- Highest scored summary (4.73) effectively captured core info 
- Summaries conveyed main messages but reduced technical depth
- Changed language from specialist to non-specialist tone

Conclusions
- ChatGPT can adequately summarize scientific content  
- It captures essential information and core message
- Slightly diminishes technical details and depth
- Tone becomes less scientific and more informal
- Useful for quick, informal comprehension but not academic publication

Limitations
- Small sample of papers and interviewees
- Subjective nature of qualitative analysis
- Scope focused on a specific research domain

The paper provides an initial analysis of ChatGPT's summarization capabilities on academic writing through interviews with domain experts. While showing promise in conveying high-level messages, the technical precision proves lacking - an important consideration for further applications.
