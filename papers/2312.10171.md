# [Pipeline and Dataset Generation for Automated Fact-checking in Almost   Any Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Automated fact-checking in languages other than English remains challenging, mainly due to the lack of annotated training data. Existing datasets in English cannot be easily transferred to other languages. Generating synthetic training data through machine translation introduces significant noise. Manually annotating fact-checking datasets is expensive and time-consuming. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an automated fact-checking pipeline focused on facilitating implementation in multiple languages. The key idea is to generate synthetic training data using a modified Question Answering for Claim Generation (QACG) scheme that requires only a moderate amount of translated data. 

The pipeline has two main modules - evidence retrieval and claim veracity evaluation. It uses paragraph-level evidence instead of sentences to provide more context. The evidence retrieval module uses the state-of-the-art ColBERTv2 method. The claim veracity module employs natural language inference using XLM-RoBERTa model.

The authors generate QACG datasets in Czech, English, Polish and Slovak using translated question answering data and Wikipedia snapshots. The synthetic claims are based on named entities extracted from Wikipedia paragraphs. Models are trained on aggregated multilingual QACG data.

Contributions:

- Automated fact-checking pipeline focused on multilingual transferability using synthetic data generation

- Modified QACG scheme to generate claims directly from evidence paragraphs using only small translated datasets 

- QACG datasets and trained models released for four languages

- Evaluation of both pipeline modules, including human annotations and difficulty estimation

- Analysis of differences between QACG and existing FEVER datasets

- Prototype FactSearch application with pipeline and user feedback

The proposed pipeline and data generation scheme allows bootstrapping of fact-checking for new languages with limited resources. Both quantitative analysis and user feedback confirm the potential of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an automated fact-checking pipeline for multiple languages that uses synthetically generated training data and operates on the paragraph level, with models and implementations provided for Czech, English, Polish and Slovak based on full Wikipedia snapshots.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Building an automated fact-checking pipeline aimed to be easily adaptable to any language using limited computational resources. This is achieved by using synthetically generated training data via the Question Answering for Claim Generation (QACG) method.

2. Providing all the QACG data and models needed to generate training data in Czech, English, Polish and Slovak. This includes machine translated versions of key datasets like SQuAD and QATD.

3. Releasing extensive fact-checking training datasets derived from Wikipedia for four languages along with evidence retrieval and natural language inference models trained on this data.

4. Comprehensively evaluating the pipeline quantitatively and qualitatively for all four languages, including human annotations and difficulty assessment using Pointwise V-information.

5. Proposing two methods to improve evidence retrieval - ColBERTANS (evidence filtering) and ColBERTNLI (evidence reranking).

6. Developing a FactSearch application featuring the pipeline and getting preliminary user feedback on its performance.

In summary, the main contribution is designing and building an automated fact-checking pipeline that can be easily adapted to new languages, evaluating it thoroughly, and releasing all the resources to reproduce the results.

The paper presents an automated fact-checking pipeline that focuses on evidence retrieval and claim veracity evaluation. It utilizes the Question Answering for Claim Generation (QACG) method to synthetically generate training data. The pipeline works at the paragraph level and uses models like ColBERTvT for evidence retrieval and XLMR for claim verification via natural language inference. The difficulty of the datasets is analyzed using Pointwise V-information. Experiments are done for four languages - Czech, English, Polish and Slovak. Machine translation is used to create some of the required datasets. Models are trained using Wikipedia snapshots. A prototype FactSearch application is also presented that implements the pipeline.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a pipeline for automated fact-checking. What are the key modules in this pipeline and how do they work together? Explain the evidence retrieval and claim veracity evaluation modules in detail.

2. The paper uses Question Answering for Claim Generation (QACG) to generate synthetic training data. Explain the QACG process step-by-step. How is it modified compared to the original implementation?

3. What is the motivation behind working at the paragraph level instead of using individual sentences as evidence? What are the practical advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

4. Explain how SUPPORTED, REFUTED and NOT ENOUGH INFO claims are generated using the QACG pipeline. What alterations were made to the original QACG approach, especially for REFUTED claims?

5. The paper compares monolingual and multilingual models for both evidence retrieval and claim veracity tasks. Analyze these results - which models perform better and why? What role does the QACG-SUM dataset play?

6. Pointwise V-information (PVI) is used to evaluate dataset difficulty. Explain the PVI concept and interpret the results in Table 5. What insight does it provide into the datasets?

7. Human evaluation reveals higher failure rates for QACG compared to FEVER datasets. Speculate on the possible reasons behind this. How do annotation guidelines play a role?

8. Two evidence retrieval augmentations are explored - Anserini filtering and NLI reranking. Analyze the motivation and outcomes of these two methods based on quantitative analysis and human evaluation. 

9. The paper mentions limited transferability between FEVER and QACG domains. What results showcase this characteristic and why does this happen? Suggest ways to potentially improve generalization capability.

10. The FactSearch application provides initial user feedback. Summarize the key concerns reported and map them to quantitative analyses done in the paper. Propose possible improvements to address these.
