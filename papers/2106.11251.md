# [Pseudo-Relevance Feedback for Multiple Representation Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11251)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: Can a multiple representation dense retrieval approach be enhanced by pseudo-relevance feedback?

The key hypothesis is that identifying more related embeddings from the top-ranked documents retrieved in the first pass can help refine the document ranking in a multiple representation dense retrieval system like ColBERT. The authors propose a novel contextualized pseudo-relevance feedback method called ColBERT-PRF to test this hypothesis.

The main contributions are:

1) Proposing ColBERT-PRF, the first pseudo-relevance feedback mechanism for dense retrieval.

2) Clustering and ranking feedback document embeddings to select candidate expansion embeddings.

3) Evaluating ColBERT-PRF in both ranking and reranking settings and showing significant improvements over ColBERT end-to-end dense retrieval.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates a new technique for applying pseudo-relevance feedback to enhance multiple representation dense retrieval systems. The central hypothesis is that adding discriminative and representative embeddings from feedback documents can improve ranking accuracy.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel pseudo-relevance feedback approach called ColBERT-PRF that enhances dense retrieval in multiple representation settings by extracting representative feedback embeddings using clustering, identifying discriminative ones based on IDF, and appending them to the original query representation to improve retrieval effectiveness without requiring retraining of the ColBERT model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in pseudo-relevance feedback for dense retrieval:

- This paper proposes ColBERT-PRF, a novel method for applying pseudo-relevance feedback to dense retrieval models like ColBERT. It is the first work to investigate PRF for dense retrieval, whereas prior PRF research focused on traditional sparse retrieval and neural reranking.

- ColBERT-PRF operates entirely within the dense embedding space, clustering feedback embeddings and appending the most discriminative ones to the query. This avoids issues like topic drift that can occur when mapping embeddings back to words.

- Experiments show ColBERT-PRF significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness of ColBERT on TREC Deep Learning track data. It outperforms strong baselines like RM3, doc2query, ANCE, and BERT-QE reranking.

- The paper introduces innovations like using KMeans clustering and IDF weighting to identify useful feedback embeddings in a dense setting. This is a new perspective compared to prior statistical or neural network approaches to PRF.

- ColBERT-PRF is efficient in that it requires no additional training beyond the base ColBERT model. Some neural PRF techniques like BERT-QE have very high computational overhead.

- There are still opportunities to build on this work, like replacing KMeans with more efficient clustering methods or exploring long-document collections. But overall, this paper presents a novel and promising direction for PRF in dense retrieval.

In summary, this paper breaks new ground by successfully adapting PRF, which has a long history in sparse retrieval, to modern dense representations like ColBERT. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique compared to existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend the approach to test collections with longer documents. The experiments in the paper were conducted on a passage ranking dataset (MS MARCO). The authors suggest verifying the effectiveness of their approach on datasets with full-length documents.

- Explore variations of the clustering algorithm used. The proposed ColBERT-PRF approach uses KMeans clustering to identify representative embeddings from the feedback documents. The authors suggest exploring more efficient clustering algorithms, either per-query online clustering or offline clustering based on the existing dense index.

- Replace the token-level IDF calculation for identifying discriminative embeddings. Currently, ColBERT-PRF maps embeddings back to tokens to calculate IDF weights and identify important expansion embeddings. The authors suggest researching alternative ways to measure embedding informativeness directly in the embedding space, without mapping back to tokens.

- Investigate the efficiency of the approach further. While ColBERT-PRF shows significant effectiveness improvements, the authors note its response time is higher than some baselines. They suggest future work could focus on optimizing the efficiency, for example by more conservative second-pass retrieval settings.

- Adapt the approach to other multiple representation dense retrieval models beyond ColBERT. The authors propose ColBERT-PRF specifically for the ColBERT dense retriever, but suggest it may be adaptable to other similar dense retrieval methods.

- Explore variations of the feedback embedding integration. The paper proposed one way of integrating the expansion embeddings into the query representation and scoring. The authors could investigate alternate ways of leveraging the feedback embeddings.

In summary, the main future directions are: applying it to longer documents, finding more efficient variations of the approach, adapting it to other dense retrievers, and exploring alternate ways to leverage the feedback embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pseudo-relevance feedback method called ColBERT-PRF for enhancing multiple representation dense retrieval models like ColBERT. Pseudo-relevance feedback uses top-ranked documents from an initial retrieval to expand the query representation and improve retrieval performance. The proposed ColBERT-PRF approach first extracts representative feedback embeddings from the initial retrieval results using KMeans clustering. It then identifies the most discriminative embeddings among these using IDF weights. These discriminative embeddings are appended to the original query representation. Experiments on TREC 2019 and 2020 datasets show ColBERT-PRF significantly outperforms the baseline ColBERT model and other lexical and neural baselines in terms of MAP, NDCG, etc. The method is robust across different parameter settings and provides the first investigation of pseudo-relevance feedback for dense retrieval models like ColBERT which use multiple embeddings to represent queries and documents.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a pseudo-relevance feedback method called ColBERT-PRF for multiple representation dense retrieval. The main steps of the method are:

1) Perform initial retrieval using ColBERT to get a set of feedback documents. 

2) Extract all document embeddings from the feedback documents. 

3) Apply K-means clustering on the extracted embeddings to identify representative centroid embeddings.

4) Map each centroid embedding to its most likely corresponding token using approximate nearest neighbor search. Calculate the IDF of the mapped token to determine the informativeness of the centroid embedding. 

5) Select the top informative centroid embeddings as expansion embeddings and append them to the original query embeddings. 

6) Rerank or re-retrieve documents using the expanded query embeddings, giving additional weight to the expansion embeddings.

In summary, the key aspects are using K-means clustering on feedback document embeddings to find representative and informative expansion embeddings, and integrating those expansion embeddings into multiple representation dense retrieval. This PRF method is shown to significantly improve retrieval effectiveness over the ColBERT baseline.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of applying pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) techniques to dense retrieval models. Some key points:

- PRF is a common technique in information retrieval to expand/reweight queries using information from top-ranked "pseudo-relevant" documents. This helps deal with vocabulary mismatch issues. 

- Dense retrieval models like ColBERT are an emerging alternative to traditional sparse retrieval models. They represent queries/documents as dense embeddings and do approximate nearest neighbor search to retrieve documents. 

- But PRF has not been explored for dense retrieval before. The paper proposes a method called ColBERT-PRF to do PRF with a multi-representation dense retriever like ColBERT.

- The key ideas are: cluster the embeddings from pseudo-relevant docs to find "representative" centroids, select discriminative centroids using IDF, and append these to the original query embeddings.

- Experiments on TREC DL passage ranking datasets show ColBERT-PRF significantly improves over ColBERT, demonstrating the promise of PRF for dense retrieval. It outperforms various baselines and is the first method to do PRF in dense retrieval settings.

In summary, the key problem is applying the well-known PRF technique to the newer dense retrieval methods to improve their effectiveness. The paper proposes a novel method ColBERT-PRF to achieve this.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pseudo-relevance feedback mechanism called ColBERT-PRF for enhancing dense retrieval using multiple representations. Dense retrieval models like ColBERT represent queries and documents as embeddings rather than sparse vectors. The authors propose using k-means clustering on the embeddings from top-ranked feedback documents to identify representative centroids. They then select the most discriminative centroids using IDF scores and append these expansion embeddings to the original query embeddings. ColBERT-PRF can be used for both ranking and reranking. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning track datasets show ColBERT-PRF significantly improves ColBERT's retrieval effectiveness, with up to 26% MAP gains on TREC 2019.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pseudo-relevance feedback method called ColBERT-PRF for improving dense passage retrieval using multiple contextualized representations. The existing ColBERT model represents queries and passages using multiple BERT embeddings and retrieves relevant passages in two stages - first generating candidate passages using approximate nearest neighbor search on the embeddings, then re-ranking them by computing exact relevance scores. ColBERT-PRF enhances this by extracting representative feedback embeddings from the initial pseudo-relevant passages using k-means clustering. It selects the most discriminative feedback embeddings using IDF weighting on the likely corresponding tokens. These additional contextualized embeddings are appended to the original query embeddings before retrieving and re-ranking passages. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning track datasets show ColBERT-PRF significantly improves over the base ColBERT model and other baselines like RM3, DeepCT, doc2query, and BERT-QE in terms of MAP, NDCG, MRR and Recall. The gains demonstrate the promise of pseudo-relevance feedback for dense retrieval with multiple contextualized representations.
