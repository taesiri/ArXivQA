# [DevBots can co-design APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing trend of using bots (DevBots) to support software development activities, but their use for conversational software development and collaborative API design with humans is still underexplored. 

- Existing literature lacks clarity on the relationship between DevBots and conversational software development.

- It is unclear how techniques like prompt engineering can enable effective human-DevBot collaboration for software design. 

Solution:
- The authors conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to analyze 24 papers on DevBots and identify their common features, use cases and relationship to conversational software development.

- They proposed an experiment for collaborative API design between a human and DevBot using prompt engineering, with and without retrieval augmented generation (RAG). 

- GPT-3.5 was used to generate OpenAPI specifications based on a prompt, with RAG leveraging existing specs as examples.

Key Contributions:
- Identified common DevBot features like natural language processing, intelligent behavior, answering questions, etc.

- Mapped various DevBot use cases from issue management to requirements specification.

- Discussed how prompt engineering can elicit requirements and testing scenarios from human-DevBot conversations.

- Performed first experiment on using prompt engineering for human-DevBot collaborative API design.

- Evaluated impact of RAG on quality of generated API specs, but results were inconclusive over simply using GPT-3.5 alone.

- Showed feasibility of collaborative API design between human and DevBot, outlined path for future research.

In summary, the paper systematically analyzed DevBot capabilities, proposed a novel application in collaborative API design, but further research is needed to conclude on benefits of techniques like RAG.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper reviews the state of the art in using DevBots for software development, proposes an experiment on collaborative API design between a human and an AI agent, and finds that while DevBots can collaborate with humans on API design, more research is needed to determine if retrieval augmented generation improves the results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing and conducting an experiment to evaluate the use of large language models (LLMs) with and without retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for collaborative API design between a human designer and a DevBot. 

Specifically, the experiment involves creating OpenAPI specification documents for an API using prompts provided to the LLM GPT-3.5, both with and without RAG. The RAG approach provides relevant API specification documents to augment the LLM's generation ability. The results are analyzed to assess the impact of RAG on the quality and correctness of the generated specifications.

While the experiment results are considered inconclusive regarding the benefits of RAG, the paper discusses the potential of using DevBots powered by LLMs for collaborative API design and identifies it as an open research area worth further exploration. Overall, the key contribution is identifying and evaluating this novel application scenario for AI-assisted software development.

The paper discusses the use of DevBots, which are automated bots to support software development, in particular looking at their use for conversational software development. It reviews the literature on DevBots and then proposes an experiment using large language models like GPT-3.5 for collaborative API design between a human and a DevBot. The experiment evaluates a retrieval augmented generation approach to generate OpenAPI specifications. Key concepts explored include prompt engineering, prompt optimization, and evaluating the impact of retrieval augmented generation on the quality of autogenerated API specifications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an experiment to evaluate the use of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) in collaborative API design between a human and an AI system. What are the key components of the RAG approach used in this experiment? How is it different from just using the generative model alone?

2. The authors crafted two different prompts for the generative model - one for the pipeline with RAG and one without. What specific differences were there in the prompts and why did the authors intentionally design them this way? 

3. The paper evaluated the quality of the generated OpenAPI specifications using 9 different correctness criteria. Why were these specific criteria chosen? What limitations might there be in only evaluating based on these criteria?  

4. The RAG pipeline used vector indexing and embedding of existing OpenAPI specification documents to augment the generative model. What specific technique was used for this and what were its limitations? How might this technique be improved in future work?

5. The results found that the RAG pipeline had higher consistency but more syntax errors compared to non-RAG. Why might greater consistency not translate to higher quality outputs? What could explain this discrepancy in the results?

6. Could the higher rate of syntax errors from the RAG pipeline indicate possible ways that the embedding and retrieval process impacted what the generative model produced? Why or why not?

7. The sample size was only 10 attempts per pipeline. How might running the experiment with a much larger number of attempts change the conclusions? What sample size would be more appropriate?

8. The paper found inconclusive results on whether RAG improves collaborative API design. What other objective and subjective metrics could be used to evaluate quality besides just correctness criteria?  

9. How might the approach change if instead of just an OpenAPI specification, the human and AI system collaborated to iteratively design a full API with documentation? Would RAG still provide any benefit?

10. What other techniques could augment or improve the generative model instead of RAG for collaborative API design? How could those be tested and compared experimentally?
