# [FH-TabNet: Multi-Class Familial Hypercholesterolemia Detection via a   Multi-Stage Tabular Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder leading to high LDL cholesterol levels and increased cardiovascular disease risk. Early detection is crucial but underdiagnosis is a major issue. 
- Conventional diagnosis methods have drawbacks like subjectivity, scoring complexities, resource constraints.
- Recent ML models for FH detection have focused only on binary classification with classical models. Application of deep learning is limited likely due to the categorical nature of clinical data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces FH-TabNet, a multi-stage tabular deep learning network for multi-class FH risk categorization into Definite, Probable, Possible and Unlikely.
- It uses the TabNet architecture designed for tabular data. 
- In Stage 1, it distinguishes between combined Definite & Probable and combined Possible & Unlikely categories. 
- Stage 2 has parallel TabNet classifiers for each subgroup for more refined classification.
- It uses sequential attention for adaptive feature selection at each step to enable more efficient end-to-end tabular learning.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the intuitive FH-TabNet architecture using tabular DNNs for the first multi-class FH risk assessment.
- Provides accurate predictions without genetic data, using EMRs and blood markers instead, making it cost-effective.
- Simulation shows significant F1-score improvements over traditional ML models, especially for low-prevalence categories.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative deep learning approach called FH-TabNet to address the key gaps in multi-class FH risk prediction using tabular clinical data.
