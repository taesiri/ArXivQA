# [A Representative Study on Human Detection of Artificially Generated   Media Across Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05976)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-generated media like deepfakes are becoming more advanced and widespread, but there has been little research on people's ability to detect them, especially across countries and media types. 

- Prior work often focuses on just one type of media (usually images) with small or non-representative samples.

- This paper aims to establish the first cross-country and cross-media baseline for people's ability to detect state-of-the-art AI-generated audio, images, and text.

Method:
- Preregistered online survey with 3,002 participants from USA, Germany, and China. 

- Participants were shown real and AI-generated examples of audio, images, or text, and asked to rate if each one seemed human or machine generated.

- Regression analysis was used to model the influence of demographic and cognitive factors on detection accuracy.

Results:
- Across all countries and media types, most AI-generated content was rated by people as more likely to be human-generated. Detection accuracy was around or below 50%.

- Audio was easiest and images hardest to identify as AI-generated. But even for audio, most people were just guessing.

- Cognitive factors like trust, reflection, and familiarity significantly influenced detection accuracy across media types. Other demographic factors had little influence.

Conclusions:
- State-of-the-art AI-generated media is now virtually indistinguishable from real media for most people. Participants predominantly guessed when trying to identify machine-generated content.

- More research is needed not on avoiding AI-generated media, but on living with it through careful legislation informed by studies on human perception and values.

Main contributions:
- First large-scale preregistered study on ability to detect AI-generated media across countries and modalities
- Found high-quality AI content convinces most people it is human-generated 
- Identified cognitive factors that influence detection across media types
