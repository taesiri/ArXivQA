# [GaussianEditor: Swift and Controllable 3D Editing with Gaussian   Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14521)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents GaussianEditor, a novel and efficient 3D editing algorithm for Gaussian Splatting representations that enables precise control and rapid editing. The method introduces Gaussian semantic tracing to consistently identify and track the Gaussians requiring modification throughout the editing process. This facilitates selective application of gradients and constraints only on the desired areas. Additionally, a new representation called Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HGS) is proposed to enhance stability when optimizing under stochastic guidance from 2D diffusion models. HGS moderates the fluidity of Gaussians by imposing varying constraints based on their age, allowing continuous carving of details while retaining overall geometry. The paper also puts forth specialized techniques for efficient 3D inpainting with Gaussian Splatting, enabling swift object removal and insertion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate GaussianEditor's superior controllability, quality and speed compared to previous state-of-the-art 3D editing approaches, with single sessions taking only 5-10 minutes. The method's precise control, versatile editing capacities and rapid performance mark a notable advance in the realm of 3D editing.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) The introduction of Gaussian semantic tracing, which enables more detailed and effective editing control by consistently identifying and tracking the Gaussians requiring editing throughout the training process. 

2) The proposal of Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a novel GS representation that is more robust and adept at accommodating highly random generative guidance during editing by imposing varying constraints on Gaussians from different generations.

3) The development of a specialized 3D inpainting algorithm for Gaussian Splatting that allows for swift removal and addition of objects in scenes.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrating that their proposed method, GaussianEditor, surpasses previous 3D editing methods in terms of effectiveness, speed, and controllability.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling swift, controllable and versatile 3D editing with Gaussian Splatting through enhancements like Gaussian semantic tracing and Hierarchical GS, along with a tailored 3D inpainting approach.
