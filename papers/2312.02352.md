# [Working Backwards: Learning to Place by Picking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Working Backwards: Learning to Place by Picking":

Problem:
- Object placing is an essential capability for autonomous robots to perform household chores like setting the table or loading the dishwasher. However, designing robotic placing policies is challenging as it involves solving subtasks like perception, planning, and control. 
- Imitation learning provides a practical way to learn end-to-end policies from demonstrations, but collecting a large and diverse set of human demonstrations is time-consuming and laborious.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a self-supervised data collection approach called "Learning to Place by Picking" (LPP) that automatically collects placing demonstrations by exploiting the symmetry between picking and placing.  
- The key ideas of LPP:
  - Use an off-the-shelf grasp planner to generate pick poses and pick objects placed at target locations 
  - During the pick, record the trajectory 
  - Reverse the trajectory to generate place demonstrations
  - Learn a visual policy with behavioral cloning using the collected demonstrations
- LPP includes modules for compliant control and tactile-based regrasping to enable robust data collection without human intervention.  

Main Contributions:
- LPP - a self-supervised method to autonomously collect a large and diverse set of demonstrations for manipulation tasks like placing
- A pipeline combining language-based instructions, object detection, segmentation and grasp planning to automatically pick target objects
- Experiments showing LPP can collect placing demonstrations more efficiently than kinesthetic teaching
- Real-world validation by training policies with LPP demonstrations for dish rack loading and table setting tasks  

In summary, the paper proposes an automatic approach to collect placing demonstrations by reversing previously performed picks, enabling efficient self-supervised data collection. The demonstrations can be used to train robotic placing policies that outperform those learned from human kinesthetic teaching.
