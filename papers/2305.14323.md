# ChatCoT: Tool-Augmented Chain-of-Thought Reasoning on Chat-based Large   Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that modeling the interaction between large language models (LLMs) and external tools as a multi-turn conversation can improve the reasoning abilities of chat-based LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. The key ideas are:1) External tools like calculators and retrievers can help LLMs perform basic functions and access knowledge needed for complex reasoning. However, incorporating these tools interrupts the continuity of LLM reasoning. 2) Chat-based LLMs have excellent abilities for multi-turn conversation. Modeling tool usage as conversation turns allows seamless integration of reasoning and tool manipulation.3) By initializing the conversation with knowledge of tools, tasks, and reasoning format, then iterating tool-augmented reasoning steps, chat-based LLMs can perform step-by-step reasoning while freely utilizing tools as needed.So in summary, the paper hypothesizes that leveraging the conversational strengths of chat-based LLMs will allow better integration of reasoning and tool usage for improved performance on complex reasoning. The proposed ChatCoT framework implements this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing ChatCoT, a new chain-of-thought reasoning framework that uses multi-turn conversations to allow large language models (LLMs) to freely interact with external tools while maintaining continuity in the reasoning process. 2. Modeling the interaction between LLMs and tools as a conversation, with the LLM able to send requests to tools and receive functional responses at each turn. This leverages the chatting abilities of chat-based LLMs like ChatGPT.3. Initializing the conversation with useful knowledge like available tools, task examples, and reasoning format to guide the LLM.4. Iterating a tool-augmented reasoning step where the LLM interacts with tools as needed to perform step-by-step reasoning until reaching the final answer.5. Evaluating ChatCoT on ChatGPT for complex reasoning tasks like mathematics problems and HotpotQA question answering. Results show significant improvements over baselines like chain-of-thought prompting, indicating the effectiveness for reasoning.6. Showing ChatCoT can be integrated with other CoT enhancement strategies like self-consistency, and achieves even better relative gains compared to vanilla CoT.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing ChatCoT to unite reasoning and tool use in a natural conversation framework that fits chat-based LLMs, while showing strong results on complex reasoning tasks. The idea of modeling tool interactions as conversational turns seems particularly novel and impactful.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes ChatCoT, a method to improve reasoning of chat-based language models by decomposing reasoning into a multi-turn conversation where the model can interact with tools as needed.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on improving reasoning abilities of large language models:- It focuses on complex reasoning tasks that require using external tools, whereas much prior work has focused just on the reasoning abilities of LLMs without integrating external tools. The paper argues that tools are necessary for handling certain functionality LLMs struggle with.- It proposes modeling the tool usage as a conversation between the LLM and tools, rather than having separate stages of planning tool usage then executing the plan. Other work relies on upfront planning or switching between LLM reasoning and tool actions.- The proposed ChatCoT framework allows integrating tool usage within an ongoing chain of thought reasoning process, avoiding disrupting the continuity of reasoning. This differs from prior work where tool usage interrupts the reasoning chain.- Experiments are conducted on mathematical and multi-hop QA reasoning tasks. Performance improvements are shown compared to CoT prompting and other baselines, demonstrating the benefit of conversational tool integration.- The approach aims to provide a general framework for tool integration applicable across tasks, vs. prior task-specific methods. The conversational format and iterative reasoning steps allow flexible tool usage.In summary, a key distinction is conversational integration of tools to augment chain of thought reasoning, while maintaining continuous reasoning instead of separate planning and execution stages. The experiments on two complex reasoning tasks highlight the potential of this approach.
