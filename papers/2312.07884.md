## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel mutual-learning knowledge distillation framework (MLKD) for robust and fast nighttime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. An advanced teacher model comprised of a state-of-the-art low-light enhancer and superior tracking backbone guides multiple lightweight student models that solely utilize the tracking backbone to directly extract features from nighttime images. The students employ diverse distillation methods to focus learning on different aspects of the teacher's knowledge. A mutual-learning room dynamically selects the best performing student each frame to assist the other students via an additional loss, enabling comprehensive learning. The final best student model, MLKD-Track, demonstrates superior performance to the teacher model in some cases, while being faster and more suitable for UAVs. Extensive experiments on UAV tracking benchmarks verify MLKD-Track surpasses state-of-the-art trackers in various metrics. Additional analysis confirms the contributions of the proposed correlation losses and mutual learning. Real-world UAV tests in challenging low-light conditions showcase the practical effectiveness and robustness of the presented approach.
