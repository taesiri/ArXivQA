# [Is GPT-4 a Good Data Analyst?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15038)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is:"Is GPT-4 a good data analyst?"More specifically, the paper conducts an investigation to determine whether large language models like GPT-4 have the capabilities to effectively take on the role and responsibilities of a human data analyst. The key aspects of a data analyst's job that the paper evaluates include:- Extracting relevant data from databases based on business requirements- Presenting data visualizations in an understandable way - Providing insightful data analysis To systematically evaluate GPT-4's performance as a data analyst, the authors design an end-to-end framework that prompts GPT-4 to do tasks like generating SQL queries, plotting visualizations, and providing bullet point analysis. They compare GPT-4's outputs to those from human data analysts across various evaluation metrics.The central hypothesis is that GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to human data analysts on these data analysis tasks. The paper aims to preliminarily test this hypothesis through experimental evaluation, while also discussing limitations and areas for future work before definitively concluding that AI can replace human analysts.In summary, the key research question is whether GPT-4 is capable of effectively taking on the role of a data analyst, which the paper examines through quantitative analysis and human evaluations. The end goal is to determine if large language models can potentially replace or assist human analysts in data-driven business roles.
