# [Is GPT-4 a Good Data Analyst?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15038)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is:"Is GPT-4 a good data analyst?"More specifically, the paper conducts an investigation to determine whether large language models like GPT-4 have the capabilities to effectively take on the role and responsibilities of a human data analyst. The key aspects of a data analyst's job that the paper evaluates include:- Extracting relevant data from databases based on business requirements- Presenting data visualizations in an understandable way - Providing insightful data analysis To systematically evaluate GPT-4's performance as a data analyst, the authors design an end-to-end framework that prompts GPT-4 to do tasks like generating SQL queries, plotting visualizations, and providing bullet point analysis. They compare GPT-4's outputs to those from human data analysts across various evaluation metrics.The central hypothesis is that GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to human data analysts on these data analysis tasks. The paper aims to preliminarily test this hypothesis through experimental evaluation, while also discussing limitations and areas for future work before definitively concluding that AI can replace human analysts.In summary, the key research question is whether GPT-4 is capable of effectively taking on the role of a data analyst, which the paper examines through quantitative analysis and human evaluations. The end goal is to determine if large language models can potentially replace or assist human analysts in data-driven business roles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper explores the question of whether the large language model GPT-4 can perform the role of a data analyst. The main contributions are:1. The paper proposes a framework to evaluate GPT-4's abilities as a data analyst by prompting it to conduct end-to-end data analysis on various databases. This involves generating code to extract and visualize data, as well as providing insights and analysis. 2. The authors design task-specific evaluation metrics and conduct comparative studies between GPT-4 and human data analysts. This allows a systematic assessment of the pros and cons of using GPT-4 versus human analysts.3. Through experiments on 100 question-database pairs, the results show GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to human analysts in terms of data extraction, visualization, and analysis. However, further studies are needed before concluding GPT-4 can fully replace human analysts.4. The paper provides insightful discussions on the limitations of the current experiments, such as the simplicity of questions and lack of complete practical business scenarios. This sheds light on future research directions.5. Overall, this is the first quantitative study that evaluates the capabilities of large language models as data analysts. The framework, evaluation metrics, experiments and discussions contribute to an improved understanding of the potential for AI to take on such professional roles.In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive framework and study to determine if GPT-4 can act as a data analyst, providing evidence it can match humans in some respects while highlighting areas needing further research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes an end-to-end framework for using GPT-4 as a data analyst to extract relevant data, generate visualizations, and produce data analysis, and finds through experiments that GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to human analysts while being much faster and cheaper.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework to evaluate GPT-4's potential as a data analyst. This is a novel direction since prior work has not specifically examined how large language models like GPT perform at end-to-end data analysis tasks.- Most prior work has focused on evaluating GPT models on core NLP tasks like text classification, question answering, summarization etc. This paper expands the scope by testing on more specialized analytical skills needed for data science jobs.- Some recent papers have explored GPT's capabilities beyond NLP, like in chip design [1], legal writing [2], patent claim generation [3] etc. However, this paper is one of the first to assess aptitude for professional data analysis roles.- In terms of methodology, this paper introduces customized prompts and metrics to systematically test GPT-4 across data extraction, visualization and insight generation. The human evaluation and comparisons are also more rigorous than in some related works.- The findings contribute new insights around GPT-4's strengths and weaknesses at replicating human-level analysis. The discussion on limitations around accuracy, assumptions, and practical questions also adds useful nuance.In summary, this paper pushes research forward in assessing suitability of large language models for professional tasks. The novel application to data analysis, custom evaluation framework and in-depth benchmarking represent clear contributions to the existing literature.[1] Shao, Y. et al. 2021.
