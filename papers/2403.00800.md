# [Brain-Inspired Two-Stage Approach: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning by   Imitating Human Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) lack strong logical reasoning skills for complex multi-step mathematical reasoning tasks. 
- Simply fine-tuning or prompting LLMs is not enough to significantly enhance their reasoning abilities.
- Existing methods that use process reward models or lean reward models to verify reasoning chains are costly and train the "planning" and "reasoning calculation" abilities simultaneously, limiting performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A new approach called "Brain" that imitates human thought processes with two specialized models - the Frontal Lobe Model for planning and the Parietal Lobe Model for logical reasoning code generation.
- Explicitly extract plans from LLM outputs using prompts, then train each model separately. 
- Frontal Lobe Model is optimized using Direct Preference Optimization based on plan quality without needing reinforcement learning.
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other Code LLaMA 7B based models.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes Brain, a two-stage approach that decomposes complex reasoning into planning and code generation to simulate human problem solving.
- Shows plans can be explicitly extracted from natural language, code or formal language outputs of LLMs.
- Demonstrates improving plan quality directly enhances reasoning accuracy.
- Achieves 74% accuracy on GSM8K benchmark, outperforming prior Code LLaMA 7B models.
- Provides insights into limitations of jointly training planning and reasoning in LLMs.

The summary covers the key details on the problem being addressed, the Brain solution proposed, and highlights the main contributions around performance, plan extraction and modelling separate reasoning stages.
