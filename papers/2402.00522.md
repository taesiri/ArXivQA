# [Understanding the Expressive Power and Mechanisms of Transformer for   Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00522)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the problem of modeling long but sparse memories that dynamically depend on the current input, referred to as "adaptive sparse memories". For example, given input $\bx_t$, the target output may depend on past inputs $\bx_{t-t_1}, \bx_{t-t_2},...,\bx_{t-t_M}$ where the time lags $t_1,t_2,...,t_M$ depend on $\bx_t$. 

- Modeling such adaptive sparse memories is challenging for standard transformers due to the discrete and input-dependent nature of the time lags.

Proposed Solution:
- The key idea is to leverage the interaction between the temporal space (provided by relative positional encoding) and token space (provided by dot-product attention) to extract the adaptive sparse memories.

- Specifically, the paper proposes a multi-layer transformer where the first few self-attention layers use residual feedforward networks (FFNs) to map the input $\bx_t$ into a representation that includes the time lags. Then the next few self-attention layers use relative positional encoding (RPE) to extract the memories $\bx_{t-t_1},...,\bx_{t-t_M}$ based on the encoded time lags.

- Both linear and logarithmic RPE schemes are analyzed. The linear RPE matches discrete time lags, while logarithmic RPE matches relative time ratios.

Main Contributions:

- Provides approximation guarantees for modeling adaptive sparse memories using multi-layer transformers with FFNs and RPE. 

- Derives width and depth requirements for both linear and logarithmic RPE schemes. Key finding is that depth can significantly reduce width demands by distributing memory extraction over layers.

- Proves limitations of dot-product-free attention, and proposes a simpler "TMX" attention that retains effectiveness.

- Overall, provides important theoretical justification for using deep transformers with FFNs and RPE to model adaptive sparse long-term memories.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the summary further! I aimed to capture the key points clearly and concisely.
