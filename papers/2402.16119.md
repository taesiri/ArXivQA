# [DeepForge: Leveraging AI for Microstructural Control in Metal Forming   via Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Precise control of microstructure during hot closed-die forging is challenging but critical to achieve desired mechanical properties in forged components. Variabilities in process conditions lead to inconsistencies.
- Limited research exists on closed-loop control systems to regulate temperature and microstructure in metal forming. More sophisticated models and control approaches are needed.
- Difficulty in directly measuring internal microstructural evolution makes property control complicated. Soft sensors that can infer non-observable states are required.

Proposed Solution
- Develops DeepForge, a machine learning model using 1D CNN and GRU architectures, to predict microstructure from surface temperatures.
- Integrates DeepForge predictions into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that optimizes wait times to achieve target grain size.
- Treats temperature variations as controllable parameters. Adaptively adjusts wait times in response to disturbances.

Key Contributions
- DeepForge accurately predicts 6 microstructural parameters from surface temperatures with <1% error. Functions as soft sensor.
- MPC integration enables real-time microstructure control by manipulating wait times. Validated experimentally.
- First-of-its-kind integration of advanced ML architecture with MPC for in-situ microstructure regulation.
- Significant advancement over traditional methods by utilizing directly measurable data for property control.
- Demonstrates improved control and quality in forging via temperature variations as an additional degree of freedom.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing an integrated ML and control framework for real-time microstructure control in metal forming processes. The feasibility of this precise control approach is demonstrated through experimental validation.
