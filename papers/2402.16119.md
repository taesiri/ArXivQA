## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Precise control of microstructure during hot closed-die forging is challenging but critical to achieve desired mechanical properties in forged components. Variabilities in process conditions lead to inconsistencies.
- Limited research exists on closed-loop control systems to regulate temperature and microstructure in metal forming. More sophisticated models and control approaches are needed.
- Difficulty in directly measuring internal microstructural evolution makes property control complicated. Soft sensors that can infer non-observable states are required.

Proposed Solution
- Develops DeepForge, a machine learning model using 1D CNN and GRU architectures, to predict microstructure from surface temperatures.
- Integrates DeepForge predictions into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that optimizes wait times to achieve target grain size.
- Treats temperature variations as controllable parameters. Adaptively adjusts wait times in response to disturbances.

Key Contributions
- DeepForge accurately predicts 6 microstructural parameters from surface temperatures with <1% error. Functions as soft sensor.
- MPC integration enables real-time microstructure control by manipulating wait times. Validated experimentally.
- First-of-its-kind integration of advanced ML architecture with MPC for in-situ microstructure regulation.
- Significant advancement over traditional methods by utilizing directly measurable data for property control.
- Demonstrates improved control and quality in forging via temperature variations as an additional degree of freedom.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing an integrated ML and control framework for real-time microstructure control in metal forming processes. The feasibility of this precise control approach is demonstrated through experimental validation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method that combines a machine learning model called DeepForge with model predictive control to leverage surface temperature measurements for predicting and controlling microstructure evolution in closed-die hot metal forging processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is the development and demonstration of a novel method for microstructure control in closed die hot forging. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) DeepForge - A machine learning model using 1D convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units to predict microstructure changes during forging based on surface temperature measurements. The model achieved high accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.4Â±0.3% for grain size prediction.

2) Integration of DeepForge with model predictive control (MPC) to enable real-time, closed-loop control of microstructure during the forging process by adjusting process parameters like inter-stroke wait times. This allows countering disturbances to achieve target grain sizes. 

3) Experimental validation of the approach by simulating disturbances and using the MPC framework with DeepForge to successfully maintain desired grain sizes below 35 microns. This demonstrates the method's potential for improving control and quality in industrial forging processes.

In summary, the key contribution is using machine learning and MPC for unprecedented microstructure control in hot closed-die forging processes with experimental verification, representing a major advance over existing methods.
