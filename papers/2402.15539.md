# [Speech Corpus for Korean Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Towards   Automatic Assessment Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15539)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of speech corpora for Korean children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), limiting the development of automatic assessment systems and digital therapeutics to aid diagnosis and treatment. 
- Existing corpora in other languages have limitations such as small sample sizes, lack of clinical evaluations from speech therapists, and absence of analysis connecting speech features with clinical scores.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a new Korean speech corpus specifically for children with ASD, containing recordings during speech therapy sessions.  
- Include meta information like age, gender and clinical scores for social communication severity (SCS) and pronunciation proficiency (PP) evaluated by speech therapists.
- Analyze acoustic and linguistic features extracted from the recordings in correlation with SCS and PP scores.

Main Contributions:
- First ever speech corpus for Korean children with ASD with SCS and PP annotations.
- Analysis revealing correlations between clinical scores and features related to voice quality, pitch, MFCCs and lexical aspects. 
- Findings emphasize multifaceted nature of speech assessment in ASD and provide insights for developing automatic evaluation systems.
- Current corpus has 73 children with ASD and 9 typically developing children. Target is 300 children with ASD and 50 typically developing by end of 2024.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions by constructing a new resource to advance research and systems for assessing and assisting children with ASD, along with an analysis that connects speech attributes to clinical perspectives on communication abilities.
