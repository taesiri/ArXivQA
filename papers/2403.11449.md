# [Graph Partial Label Learning with Potential Cause Discovering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modeling graph-structured data, but annotating graphs for supervised training is difficult due to their complexity and interconnectivity. 
- Learning with noisy/imperfect labels (partial label learning) is a challenging weakly supervised learning problem. Integrating partial label learning into graph representation learning is difficult due to the complexity of graph data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Graph Potential Causes Discovering (GPCD) to enable GNNs to learn effectively from graph data with noisy labels. 
- GPCD leverages the concept of "potential causes" from causal theory to extract meaningful subgraphs that likely have a causal relationship with the true labels. This helps filter out label noise during training.
- A specialized model architecture is used to identify potential cause candidates. Refinement is done to extract the potential causes.
- Auxiliary training based on the extracted subgraphs helps guide GNN training and mitigate the impact of label noise.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of GPCD, a novel approach to optimize GNN training under the partial label learning scenario by extracting potential causes from graph data.
- Comprehensive theoretical analysis done to rigorously prove concepts and justify the rationality of the potential cause extraction method.
- Extensive experiments conducted on 7 datasets demonstrating GPCD's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks under label noise.

In summary, the key innovation is the incorporation of potential cause extraction from causal theory to obtain meaningful subgraphs from complex graph data, which then facilitates effective GNN training even with noisy labels. Both theoretical and empirical validation are provided.
