# [Large Language Models Play StarCraft II: Benchmarks and A Chain of   Summarization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
StarCraft II is a complex real-time strategy game that poses significant challenges for AI agents due to the need for both precise micro-level operations and long-term strategic planning. While previous works like AlphaStar have achieved strong gameplay, they still exhibit deficiencies in aspects like strategy interpretability and adaptable unit compositions. At the same time, emerging large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in complex reasoning for decision making.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes using large language models as agents to play StarCraft II by leveraging their strategic planning abilities. To enable LLMs to interact with the game, the authors develop "TextStarCraft II", a textual version of the StarCraft II environment built using the python-sc2 interface. To enhance the LLM's capability to analyze information and make decisions, a "Chain of Summarization" method is introduced. This consists of single-frame summarization to distill key game data, and multi-frame summarization to discern trends and formulate strategies.  

Main Contributions:

1. TextStarCraft II environment enabling natural language interaction with StarCraft II

2. Chain of Summarization technique to improve LLM's reasoning for decision making

3. LLM agents demonstrate strategic capabilities like economic expansion, defensive building construction, research upgrades, and adaptive unit composition

4. LLM agents defeat built-in AI in Harder difficulty without any additional training

5. Assessments showing LLMs possess relevant StarCraft II knowledge, validated through blind reviews by 30 grandmaster players  

6. Analysis of LLM agent gameplays indicating sensible strategies but some limitations in creativity compared to humans

7. LLM agent decisions are more interpretable than AlphaStar, aided by logical reasoning grounded in historical gameplay experience

In summary, this work shows the promise of using large language models as agents in complex strategy games like StarCraft II through innovations in representation and reasoning techniques. The LLM agents showcase strategic competencies surpassing built-in AI through leveraging textual gameplay knowledge.
