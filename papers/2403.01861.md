# [AiSDF: Structure-aware Neural Signed Distance Fields in Indoor Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01861)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing online 3D scene reconstruction methods using implicit neural representations like signed distance fields (SDFs) focus mainly on efficiency rather than quality. 
- They do not exploit the inherent structural regularity (planes, rectangles, etc) of indoor scenes which can be used to improve reconstruction quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AiSDF, a novel structure-aware online SDF reconstruction framework that exploits the Atlanta World (AW) assumption about structural regularity of indoor scenes.

- Key ideas:
   - Continually estimate the AW directions (vertical + multiple horizontals)
   - Extract planar rectangular surfels aligned to AW directions 
   - Use surfels for adaptive sampling and constraints

- Process overview:
   - Get posed depth images
   - Select keyframes
   - Estimate AW directions 
   - Extract rectangular surfels 
   - Sample points on surfels and non-surfels 
   - Query MLP for SDF values
   - Optimize MLP with losses considering surfels

- Outcomes:
   - Implicit neural SDF with better quality
   - Explicit planar map composed of surfels

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea to integrate structural regularity assumptions into online neural SDF mapping
- Atlanta-aware surfel extraction for explicit planar map
- Adaptive sampling strategy using surfels
- Improved reconstruction quality with planar map
- Lightweight explicit map for robots

The method is evaluated on ScanNet and ReplicaCAD scenes, outperforming prior online SDF works like iSDF and voxel methods in quality metrics.

In summary, the paper proposes a way to leverage geometric structure in the challenging problem of online neural 3D mapping to get better reconstruction quality along with an explicit planar map.
