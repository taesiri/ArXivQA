# [Lost in Overlap: Exploring Watermark Collision in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Text watermarking methods embed invisible identifiers into machine-generated text to track ownership and guard against misuse. However, widespread adoption across diverse models leads to inevitable watermark collisions.
- Watermark collision refers to instances where multiple watermarks occur simultaneously in a text sample. This has not been studied before and poses unknown threats. 

Proposed Method  
- The authors design a pipeline with a watermarker model to generate watermarked text, and a paraphraser model to paraphrase it with a different watermark. This simulates dual watermark collisions.
- Several state-of-the-art watermarking algorithms are evaluated as baselines by tuning their watermark strength as weak or strong. The detection accuracy (TPR, FPR metrics) of both watermarks is measured to assess impact.

Key Findings
- Watermark collisions negatively affect detection of both watermarks, with one being stronger than the other. Upstream watermarks are prone to erasure from downstream ones.  
- Watermark collisions can enable malicious paraphasing attacks to easily remove existing watermarks.
- Collisions also provide a probabilistic method to detect if a text already has an unknown watermark.

Main Contributions  
- First study analyzing impact of dual watermark collisions in machine generated text.
- Demonstrates vulnerabilities of existing watermark techniques when subjected to collisions.
- Discusses potential threats posed to text ownership verification and LLM tracking from widespread watermark adoption.
- Raises awareness of this unchecked issue to inform future watermark development.
