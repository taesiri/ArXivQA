# [DETRs with Hybrid Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13080)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new hybrid matching scheme to improve the training of DETR-based models for various visual tasks like object detection and tracking. The key ideas are:- DETR models rely on one-to-one bipartite matching between predictions and ground truth during training. This leads to few positive training examples and limits training efficacy. - The proposed hybrid matching combines one-to-one matching with an auxiliary one-to-many matching branch. The one-to-many matching assigns multiple predictions to each ground truth to increase positive examples.- Inference uses only the original one-to-one branch, thus maintaining the end-to-end nature and efficiency of DETR.- Experiments across tasks like object detection, pose estimation and tracking show consistent improvements from the proposed hybrid matching scheme.In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining one-to-one and one-to-many matching during training can improve optimization and accuracy of DETR models, while retaining their end-to-end inference capability. The consistent gains across tasks validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid matching scheme to improve the training efficacy of DETR-based approaches for object detection and other vision tasks. Specifically:- They propose combining a one-to-one matching branch and a one-to-many matching branch during training. The one-to-one matching maintains the end-to-end capability of DETR while the one-to-many matching increases the number of positive training samples. - During inference, only the original one-to-one matching branch is used, thus maintaining the end-to-end merit and efficiency of DETR.- They show the hybrid matching scheme consistently improves a variety of DETR-based methods across different vision tasks, including object detection, 3D detection, pose estimation and tracking. It improves their accuracy without compromising inference speed.- For object detection, their method achieves 1.7% higher COCO AP than Deformable DETR and establishes new state-of-the-art for DETR methods. It also improves 3D detection AP by 1.5% on nuScenes.In summary, the key innovation is a simple yet effective hybrid matching scheme that boosts the training of DETR-based methods without sacrificing their end-to-end capability. The consistent gains across tasks demonstrate the generalization of this idea.
