# [Empowering Large Language Model Agents through Action Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15809)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for controlling embodied agents to accomplish tasks through planning and interaction. However, these LLM agents have limited ability to learn from experience and expand their action spaces. 
- Humans acquire skills by expanding action spaces through experiential learning, but LLM agents operate within fixed, predetermined action spaces, restricting their potential for growth.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a framework called \modelname for open-action learning in LLM agents. 
- It allows agents to dynamically generate new action types as Python functions based on experience, aligning the action space better with the LLM's planning capacities.
- \modelname employs an iterative learning strategy - it identifies errors in unsuccessful training tasks, asks the LLM to revise currently available actions, thereby improving action effectiveness through a feedback loop.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a paradigm focused on learning to expand and refine the action space of LLM agents based on experience rather than operating within a fixed action space.
- Introduces the \modelname framework to implement open-action learning using Python functions and an iterative learning strategy.
- Empirical evaluations show \modelname effectively learns customizable action spaces within a few trials and outperforms state-of-the-art agents by a significant margin.
- Demonstrates the importance of experiential action learning in developing more capable LLM agents that can expand their skills.

In summary, the key insight is that the limitations of LLM agents stem from the misalignment between planning and fixed action spaces. By enabling agents to learn new actions from experience, \modelname unlocks greater planning potential in LLMs and aligns tasks better with their capabilities. The iterative learning of customizable actions is the core contribution towards more intelligent LLM agents.
