# [Autism Detection in Speech -- A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a need to better understand linguistic, prosodic, and acoustic cues that could help identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors aim to analyze research across domains - biomedical, psychological, and natural language processing (NLP) - to find potential strategies for detecting ASD in speech.

- Specifically, the authors have two main research questions: 1) What are the gaps in current ASD detection research? 2) What potential strategies can identify ASD in speech based on findings across the three domains analyzed?

Definition of ASD:
- The paper explains how ASD diagnosis has evolved over time, from early definitions by Kanner and Asperger to more recent ICD-10 and DSM criteria. Key aspects include deficits in social communication/interaction and restricted/repetitive behaviors.  

- The focus is on high-functioning ASD subgroups like Asperger's given their stronger verbal abilities. Differences in presentation based on age and sex are also noted as important to consider.

Analysis of Bio-Med-Psych Research: 
- Verbal fluency findings are mixed - some studies find no fluency differences for AS vs neurotypicals, while others show subtle differences in strategy like using more prototypical words.

- Multiple studies point to prosodic differences as markers, like monotonic speech, pitch differences, slower speaking rate. Voice quality descriptors also differ.

Analysis of NLP Research:
- Similarly, NLP analyses reveal prosodic, lexical, disfluency and rate differences. Dictionary-based methods, ML approaches leveraging various speech features, and some transformer models are covered.

- But key gaps exist - lack of focus on females, predominance of ML vs deep learning, more audio than textual analyses, and no multimodal analyses.

In summary, while progress has been made using linguistic and acoustic cues to detect ASD automatically, gaps remain around inclusion, advanced NLP methods, and multimodality that should be addressed by future work.
