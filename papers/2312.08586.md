# [Estimating calibration error under label shift without labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08586)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper addresses the challenging problem of evaluating a machine learning model's calibration when there is a distribution shift between the training data (source) and the deployment data (target), specifically label shift, and when there are no labels available for the target data. Label shift refers to changes in the marginal label distribution between source and target, while the conditional input-label distributions remain unchanged. To tackle this, the authors propose the first consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator for calibration error under label shift without target labels. Their method relies on importance re-weighting the labeled source data to account for the label distribution shift. They derive the variance of this estimator, present an algorithm to calculate it, and compare it to a Monte Carlo estimate. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed calibration error estimator under label shift on diverse datasets, models, weight estimators, and degrees of shift. The experiments on medical imaging, language, and wildlife classification datasets confirm that their estimator can reliably assess model calibration on unlabeled target data under varying conditions. A key advantage is integrating state-of-the-art weight estimators from the domain adaptation literature. The estimator could be improved further as these methods enhance. Overall, this is an important contribution towards evaluating model reliability and trustworthiness when deploying machine learning systems in the real world.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reliable uncertainty estimation and model calibration are critical for machine learning systems, especially in safety-critical applications. 
- Calibration error (CE) measures the alignment between a model's predicted probabilities and its actual accuracy.
- Existing CE estimators assume access to labels from the target distribution. However, this assumption is often violated due to dataset shift between training (source) and deployment (target) distributions.
- The paper focuses on label shift - changes in marginal label distribution between source and target, while the conditional input distribution given a label remains unchanged. Label shift commonly occurs in real-world scenarios.
- Estimating CE under label shift without target labels poses a key challenge that has not been addressed before.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the first consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator of CE under label shift without requiring labels from the shifted target distribution. 
- The estimator employs importance re-weighting to account for the label shift when estimating CE on the source distribution. It relies on state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods to obtain importance weights.
- The variance of the proposed estimator is formally derived, providing insights into its reliability. This applies both when labels are available (source domain) and under label shift (target domain).

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first method to estimate CE under label shift without target labels, enabling assessing model calibration in this challenging yet practical scenario (ยง3)  
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the estimator on diverse datasets, models, types and intensities of label shift (ยง4.1, ยง4.2)
- Ablates the influence of sample size, ratio of source/target samples, etc. showing the approach is reliable across different conditions (ยง4.3)
- Derives variance of the estimator, and empirically validates it aligns with Monte Carlo estimates (Appendix)

The proposed method facilitates assessing model calibration under dataset shifts commonly encountered in practice, without needing expensive annotations. The estimator's favorable statistical guarantees make it suitable for safety-critical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the first method to estimate the calibration error of a model on unlabeled, label-shifted target data by leveraging importance re-weighting of the labeled source data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator for calibration error under label shift, without requiring access to labels from the label-shifted target distribution. Specifically, the paper:

1) Proposes a calibration error estimator that leverages importance re-weighting of the labeled source distribution to account for the shift in the unlabeled target distribution. 

2) Derives the variance of the proposed estimator, providing insights into its reliability. Variance formulas are provided both for when labels are available (e.g. on source data) and for the label-shifted scenario.

3) Validates the effectiveness of the proposed estimator through experiments on diverse datasets, models, weight estimators, and degrees of label shift. The method is shown to provide reliable calibration error estimates across different conditions.

In summary, the key contribution is an estimator to assess model calibration under label shift without target labels, along with extensive empirical analysis demonstrating its capabilities. The method addresses an important practical problem and enables more comprehensive evaluation of model reliability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Calibration error (CE) - A measure of the alignment between predicted probabilities of a model and its actual accuracy. The paper focuses on estimating CE under dataset shift.

- Label shift - A type of dataset shift where the marginal distribution over labels changes between source/train and target/test data, but the conditional input distribution remains unchanged. 

- Importance weighting - A technique used to re-weight the source data to account for the shift in labels and estimate target statistics.

- Asymptotically unbiased estimator - The proposed CE estimator is consistent and asymptotically unbiased under the label shift assumption.

- Variance of the estimator - The paper derives a formula for the variance of the proposed CE estimator, with and without access to labels.

- Real-world datasets - Experiments are conducted on diverse real-world datasets across modalities like images, text to demonstrate the effectiveness.

- Ablation studies - In-depth empirical analysis is performed under different ratios of label shift, sample sizes etc. to understand the estimator's behavior.

So in summary, the key focus is on estimating calibration error under label shift in the absence of target labels, using importance re-weighting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an estimator for calibration error under label shift without access to labels on the target data. What is the intuition behind using importance re-weighting of the labeled source distribution to account for the shift in the unlabeled target distribution? 

2. The variance formula for the proposed calibration error estimator is derived both for the case when labels are available (e.g. source data) and for the label-shifted scenario. Walk through the key steps in these variance derivations. What are the main challenges in estimating the variance without target labels?

3. The proposed estimator relies on estimating per-class importance weights using methods from domain adaptation literature. The experiments analyze several weight estimation methods - ELSA, RLLS, BBSL and EM-BCTS. Compare and contrast the relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods when incorporated into the calibration error estimator. 

4. Across different intensities of label shift, the experiments reveal that the performance of some weight estimation methods deteriorates. Specifically, the RLLS method appears most robust. Analyze the possible reasons behind the instability of other methods under severe shift.

5. The ablation studies explore the impact of factors like sample size, ratio of source and target samples, number of bins etc. on the proposed estimator. Discuss how each of these factors influence bias vs. variance trade-offs. 

6. Fig. 4 shows that when the source distribution itself is highly imbalanced, the calibration error estimates exhibit higher deviation from ground truth. Explain why high imbalance in source data presents difficulties.

7. The proposed estimator focuses specifically on label shift. The paper identifies covariate shift as an important direction for future work. What modifications would be needed to adapt the estimator for covariate shift?

8. Since the estimator relies on density ratio estimation, discuss how the choice of kernel may impact consistency, bias, variance, and integration into calibration methods. 

9. The experimental results are demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets. What are some key differences in evaluating the method on synthetic vs. real datasets, in terms of assumptions made?

10. The authors use the Camelyon17 dataset to simulate label shift since the original dataset does not have a test set. Propose other realistic strategies for introducing and evaluating label shift on datasets without an explicit test set.
