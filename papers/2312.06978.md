# [CLASSMix: Adaptive stain separation-based contrastive learning with   pseudo labeling for histopathological image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06978)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new semi-supervised learning model called CLASSMix for histopathological image classification. The model has two main components: contrastive learning between adaptively stain separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images, and pseudo labeling using MixUp augmentation. Slide-level adaptive stain separation is first performed to obtain the Hematoxylin and Eosin components. Augmentations are applied to the original RGB, Hematoxylin, and Eosin images. A contrastive loss encourages the ResNet encoder features from the Hematoxylin and Eosin views of the same image to be similar. MixUp is used to create mixed samples from labeled and unlabeled data, with targets set to a mix of the labels. Experiments on clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the adaptive stain separation, contrastive loss, and MixUp components. Key results show 95.35% accuracy on the Utah dataset and 92.13% on the more challenging TCGA dataset, outperforming other methods by over 3%.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning method called CLASSMix that combines contrastive learning on adaptively stain separated hematoxylin and eosin images with pseudo labeling using MixUp to achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on histopathological image datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors proposed a new semi-supervised classification model called CLASSMix for histopathological image classification. The model combines contrastive learning between adaptively stain separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images, as well as pseudo labeling using MixUp to make use of both labeled and unlabeled data.

2. The authors provided a new Utah ccRCC dataset containing tile-level labels on 49 whole slide images, as well as annotations on a TCGA ccRCC dataset containing 150 labeled whole slide images and 270 unlabeled images.

3. The authors tested various state-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods on the ccRCC datasets. Their proposed CLASSMix model achieved the best classification performance compared to other methods. They also did ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components of their model.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) proposing a new semi-supervised learning model for histopathology image classification; (2) providing new annotated ccRCC datasets; and (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the superior performance of their proposed approach.
