# [CLASSMix: Adaptive stain separation-based contrastive learning with   pseudo labeling for histopathological image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06978)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new semi-supervised learning model called CLASSMix for histopathological image classification. The model has two main components: contrastive learning between adaptively stain separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images, and pseudo labeling using MixUp augmentation. Slide-level adaptive stain separation is first performed to obtain the Hematoxylin and Eosin components. Augmentations are applied to the original RGB, Hematoxylin, and Eosin images. A contrastive loss encourages the ResNet encoder features from the Hematoxylin and Eosin views of the same image to be similar. MixUp is used to create mixed samples from labeled and unlabeled data, with targets set to a mix of the labels. Experiments on clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the adaptive stain separation, contrastive loss, and MixUp components. Key results show 95.35% accuracy on the Utah dataset and 92.13% on the more challenging TCGA dataset, outperforming other methods by over 3%.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Histopathological image classification is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, training highly accurate models requires substantial labeled data which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning can alleviate this need for large labeled datasets, but remains relatively unexplored for histopathology images.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a new semi-supervised learning model called CLASSMix that combines contrastive learning on adaptively stain separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images along with pseudo labeling using MixUp augmentation.

The key components are:
1) Slide-level adaptive stain separation to get Hematoxylin and Eosin images from RGB histology slides. Hematoxylin highlights cell nuclei while Eosin shows cytoplasm/extracellular matrix.
2) Augmentations on original RGB image and separated H&E images. 
3) Contrastive loss between H and E encoders to bring their features closer in latent space.
4) Pseudo labeling on unlabeled samples followed by MixUp augmentation to generate more labeled samples.

The model is trained end-to-end using labeled samples and pseudo-labeled mixed samples in a semi-supervised manner.

Experiments:
The method was evaluated on clear cell renal carcinoma tiles from an in-house Utah dataset and the TCGA dataset. State-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised methods were compared.

Contributions:
1) Proposed CLASSMix model combining adaptive stain separation, contrastive learning and MixUp for semi-supervised histology image classification.
2) Provided new Utah ccRCC dataset and TCGA ccRCC dataset with tile-level labels.
3) Demonstrated superior performance of CLASSMix over other methods, analyzed contributions of different components.

In summary, this paper presents a novel approach for semi-supervised learning on histopathology images that effectively utilizes domain knowledge of stain separation and combines contrastive learning with data augmentation to achieve state-of-the-art results. The labeled datasets contributed will also facilitate further research.
