# [NodeMixup: Tackling Under-Reaching for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NodeMixup: Tackling Under-Reaching for Graph Neural Networks":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) suffer from an "under-reaching" issue where labeled nodes in a graph are only accessible to a small portion of unlabeled nodes due to uneven location distribution. This leads to incomplete knowledge about unlabeled nodes during training.
- Under-reaching hinders alignment of distributions between labeled and unlabeled nodes, which is key to GNNs' effectiveness. This makes it difficult for GNNs to generalize to unseen unlabeled nodes during inference.

Proposed Solution: NodeMixup
- Core idea is to increase reachability of labeled nodes by mixing labeled and unlabeled nodes using an augmented training procedure. This facilitates distribution alignment.

- Performs "cross-set pairing" to choose node pairs from both labeled set and confident pseudo-labeled unlabeled set. Increases access of labels to more unlabeled nodes.

- Conducts "intra-class mixup" between same-class pairs. Merges neighbor connections to improve intra-class similarity. 

- Does "inter-class mixup" between different-class pairs using standard mixup. Captures more generalizable decision boundaries.

- Employs "NLD-aware sampling" to determine node sampling weights based on neighbor label distribution similarity and node degrees. Focuses on dissimilar and low-degree nodes.

Contributions:
- Identifies and analyzes under-reaching issue in GNNs through empirical observations, showing negative impact on distribution alignment.

- Proposes NodeMixup, an architecture-agnostic data augmentation method to increase labeled nodes' reachability via labeled-unlabeled node mixup guided by graph structure and sampling strategy. 

- Achieves consistent and significant performance gains when applying NodeMixup to popular GNN models over multiple graph datasets. Demonstrates general effectiveness.
