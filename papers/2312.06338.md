# [BoschAI @ Causal News Corpus 2023: Robust Cause-Effect Span Extraction   using Multi-Layer Sequence Tagging and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06338)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper describes BoschAI's approach to the Event Causality Identification Shared Task at CASE 2023. Their system ranks 3rd out of 10 teams in Subtask 1, which involves classifying whether sentences contain causal relationships. For this subtask, they train BERT and RoBERTa classifiers with weighted cross-entropy loss to handle label imbalance. Their key innovation is in Subtask 2, which requires extracting spans of text denoting the cause, effect, and optional signal in causal relations. They propose a multi-layer BILOU tagging scheme to allow handling multiple relations per sentence. On top of contextualized embeddings from RoBERTa-Large, they add a Conditional Random Field layer to encourage consistent predictions. The authors find that augmenting the limited training data with EDA helps significantly, giving the best F1 score of 72.8% on test, outperforming the next best team by 13 percentage points. Analyses show higher performance on single- vs multi-relation instances, and that further gains may come from more advanced data augmentation and scaling up models.
