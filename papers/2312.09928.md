# [Neurosymbolic Value-Inspired AI (Why, What, and How)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09928)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems like large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted across industries. However, there are growing concerns about their unintended biases and ethical issues when deployed in sensitive domains like healthcare and autonomous vehicles. 

- LLMs lack an explicit understanding of human values and norms that guide decision-making in human societies. There is a need for AI systems, especially LLMs, to incorporate human values to ensure safe and responsible functioning when assisting humans.

Proposed Solution - Value-Inspired AI (VAI):
- The paper proposes a neurosymbolic framework called Value-Inspired AI (VAI) to enable LLMs to represent and reason with human values. 

- It extends Kahneman's System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative) framework by outlining additional components needed:
  1) Dynamic knowledge graphs to represent values
  2) Brain-inspired neural networks to model different types of memories 
  3) Abstraction logics to enable communication between the neural and symbolic components
  4) Metacognition triggers to invoke the appropriate system

- By integrating these components using a neurosymbolic approach, the VAI framework allows modeling complex real-world scenarios that require value-based decision making.

Main Contributions:
- Identified the limitations of existing methods like LLMs in incorporating human values
- Proposed a novel neurosymbolic framework called VAI with detailed architecture to address this gap
- Outlined the essential components and their implementations needed to realize robust and practical VAI systems
- Discussed current progress and open challenges to guide future work on developing human value-aware AI systems

In summary, the paper makes a strong case for neurosymbolic VAI to instill human values into AI and provides concrete directions for developing such hybrid systems.
