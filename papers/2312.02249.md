# [Recursive Visual Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing visual programming (VP) methods for visual question answering (VQA) generate all code in one function, resulting in lengthy, complex code that is prone to inaccuracies and lacks interpretability. 
- As question complexity increases (e.g. multiple sub-questions, lengthy reasoning chains), single-function code generation often fails to capture all details or makes errors.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Recursive Visual Programming (RVP) which takes inspiration from human programming practices to simplify and modularize generated code.  
- RVP prompts the language model to break down questions into sub-questions, then recursively generates separate code to solve each sub-question beforecombining solutions.
- This structured decomposition improves accuracy, efficiency, interpretability, and ability to handle complex questions.
- RVP can also dynamically assign return types to match each context, enabling flexible, accurate code generation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes recursive coding for VP, integrating human-like decomposition strategies to enhance complex VQA.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA datasets including VSR, GQA, NextQA, COVR.
- Demonstrates interpretability benefits relative to non-recursive VP methods via code readability studies.  
- Introduces capability for VP methods to dynamically assign types when generating code based on context.
- Provides extensive analysis into recursive patterns, return types, question categories benefiting from recursion.

Overall, RVP advances VP methods by adopting recursive, modular programming to generate clearer, more accurate code for answering complex visual questions. Experiments and analyses confirm performance and interpretability gains.
