# [ChatGPT is not all you need. A State of the Art Review of large   Generative AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the latest advances in large generative AI models, and how are they transforming different industries/applications?The authors aim to provide a concise review of the state-of-the-art in large generative AI models that have recently emerged, and to categorize them based on the types of mappings they perform between different input and output modalities (text, image, video, audio, etc.). The key focus seems to be summarizing the capabilities of models across different categories (like text-to-image, text-to-text, etc.) and highlighting their potential impacts on sectors like art, education, programming, and science.So in summary, the main goal appears to be reviewing and taxonomizing recent progress in large generative models across different input-output modalities and applications, rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The paper serves more as a research survey and classification of the latest advances in this rapidly evolving field.
