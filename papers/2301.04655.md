- Broad coverage - While not comprehensive, this review highlights the major players across organizations like Google, Meta, OpenAI, DeepMind in this space. Other papers may focus more on models from a single lab or company. 

- Limited comparison - The models are presented independently without much direct comparison. Some other reviews do more head-to-head model comparisons on metrics like sample quality, training efficiency, etc.

Overall, this review provides a high-level overview of the bustling generative AI landscape and developments from an application perspective, complementing other reviews with more technical or company/model-specific analysis. The recency and breadth covered is a notable strength compared to other surveys.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a text-to-image generative model called Muse that achieves state-of-the-art image generation while being more efficient than previous diffusion or autoregressive models. The key method used is training the model on a masked modeling task in discrete token space. This allows the model to be trained in parallel, decoding images in one pass, unlike autoregressive models that must decode sequentially. By working in discrete space, the model is also more efficient than previous latent diffusion models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion that operate in continuous latent space. Overall, the use of discrete tokens and parallel decoding allows Muse to generate high fidelity images around 10x faster than other leading text-to-image models.
