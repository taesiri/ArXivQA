# [ChatGPT is not all you need. A State of the Art Review of large   Generative AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the latest advances in large generative AI models, and how are they transforming different industries/applications?The authors aim to provide a concise review of the state-of-the-art in large generative AI models that have recently emerged, and to categorize them based on the types of mappings they perform between different input and output modalities (text, image, video, audio, etc.). The key focus seems to be summarizing the capabilities of models across different categories (like text-to-image, text-to-text, etc.) and highlighting their potential impacts on sectors like art, education, programming, and science.So in summary, the main goal appears to be reviewing and taxonomizing recent progress in large generative models across different input-output modalities and applications, rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The paper serves more as a research survey and classification of the latest advances in this rapidly evolving field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive review and taxonomy of the latest advances in large generative AI models. Specifically:- It organizes recent influential generative models into a taxonomy based on the mapping between input and output data types (text, image, video, audio, etc.). The taxonomy highlights 9 key categories of generative models.- It gives details on over 20 major generative models that have been released in the past couple years, including models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, LaMDA, and many others. For each model, it summarizes how it works at a high level and discusses its capabilities.- It analyzes the companies and organizations behind these models, showing that only a handful of big tech companies have the resources to develop them. - It surveys applications of these models across different industries like art, gaming, science, etc. and discusses how they are revolutionizing certain sectors.- It also highlights limitations of current generative models in terms of data, computation, bias, and understanding of ethics.Overall, this review paper provides a structured overview of the state-of-the-art in generative AI, covering the most promising recent models, their applications, and current limitations. It would serve as a useful reference for anyone looking to understand the capabilities and landscape of large generative models.
