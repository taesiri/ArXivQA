## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a text-to-image generative model called Muse that achieves state-of-the-art image generation while being more efficient than previous diffusion or autoregressive models. The key method used is training the model on a masked modeling task in discrete token space. This allows the model to be trained in parallel, decoding images in one pass, unlike autoregressive models that must decode sequentially. By working in discrete space, the model is also more efficient than previous latent diffusion models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion that operate in continuous latent space. Overall, the use of discrete tokens and parallel decoding allows Muse to generate high fidelity images around 10x faster than other leading text-to-image models.
