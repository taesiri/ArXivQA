## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes E4SRec, an elegant, effective, efficient and extensible solution for applying large language models to sequential recommendation tasks. The key innovation is the injection of item ID embeddings into the language model, enabling it to leverage crucial collaborative signals contained in item IDs. This overcomes limitations of prior methods that could not effectively handle IDs and relied too much on semantic content. E4SRec generates recommendations over all candidates in one forward pass, solving efficiency and out-of-range output issues. It freezes the language model and trains only a minimal set of pluggable components per dataset, making deployment lightweight with a shared backbone model. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses highlight strengths in data sparsity, efficiency and extensibility. The proposed solution provides an elegant pathway to unlock the power of large language models for industrial recommendation systems.
