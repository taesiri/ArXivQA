# [A VR Serious Game to Increase Empathy towards Students with Phonological   Dyslexia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Dyslexia is a learning disorder that causes difficulties in reading and can lead to feelings of frustration and isolation in students. Specifically, phonological dyslexia impairs the ability to connect sounds to written letters and words, making reading challenging. There is a need to increase empathy and support for university students with dyslexia to reduce dropout rates and facilitate academic success.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a virtual reality (VR) serious game to promote understanding and empathy towards students with phonological dyslexia. In the game, players take on tasks using an alphabet designed to simulate dyslexic reading difficulties. The goal is for non-dyslexic players to experience the frustrations firsthand, increasing their empathy. Players attempt to brew a potion by reading scrambled instructions and get compensatory tools if they fail, highlighting the need for learning supports.

Key Contributions:
- Design of a VR game that uses a dyslexia-simulating font and reading-based tasks to foster empathy in non-dyslexic players 
- Player frustration followed by provision of compensatory tools demonstrates the challenges and need for supports in dyslexia
- Preliminary testing on 32 people showed the game increased difficulty and frustration, which declined with more time and tools, raising empathy
- Validation on a larger sample and extension to other dyslexia types is planned to further test effectiveness
- Overall, an innovative application of VR to facilitate understanding of phonological dyslexia in higher education through firsthand simulation of reading struggles

In summary, the paper presents a novel VR serious game that puts non-dyslexic players in the shoes of a student with phonological dyslexia to powerfully demonstrate reading challenges and the need for greater empathy and learning supports. Preliminary evidence shows this immersive approach can effectively promote understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a virtual reality serious game where players experience reading difficulties similar to those caused by phonological dyslexia, with the goal of increasing empathy and inclusion towards university students with this condition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a virtual reality (VR) serious game to increase empathy towards students with phonological dyslexia. Specifically, the paper describes a VR game where players have to complete reading-based tasks using an alphabet designed to simulate the difficulties experienced by people with dyslexia. The goal is that by experiencing these challenges directly, non-dyslexic players will gain more empathy and understanding of the issues faced by dyslexic students. This should in turn foster a more supportive and inclusive environment for dyslexic students in education. So in summary, the key contribution is using VR technology to increase empathy and awareness of phonological dyslexia among non-dyslexic people, especially teachers and peers of dyslexic students.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the game is designed to replicate reading difficulties experienced by people with dyslexia. What specific aspects of dyslexia reading challenges are simulated in the game and how are they implemented?

2. Players go through three virtual rooms in the game. What is the purpose of having multiple rooms instead of just the potions laboratory room where the main game takes place? How do the additional rooms contribute to the overall experience?

3. The potions teacher avatar plays an important role in guiding and interacting with players. What specific behaviors are programmed for this avatar to evoke feelings of frustration in players? How are these behaviors intended to help players empathize with dyslexic students?

4. The game allows players to use compensatory tools and strategies in later attempts if they fail initially. What are some examples of these tools and strategies and how are they designed to highlight the needs of students with dyslexia?  

5. What considerations went into the visual design of characters and items in the virtual environment to make them appealing while also serving the purpose of the serious game?

6. How was the difficulty level and time limit for completing the potion calibrated? What data was used and what was the rationale behind the final settings chosen?

7. What methodology was used to evaluate the game's ability to evoke empathy in players? What metrics were measured and how does the data support the claim that the game increases empathy?

8. How could the game be adapted to highlight issues faced by students with other types of dyslexia besides phonological dyslexia focused on here? What changes would need to be made?

9. What possibilities exist for expanding this game approach to raise awareness about difficulties faced by students with other types of learning disorders besides dyslexia? What are some examples?

10. What future research directions are discussed to validate and extend the effectiveness of this serious game approach for enhancing empathy toward students with dyslexia?
