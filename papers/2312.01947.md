# [Maximising Quantum-Computing Expressive Power through Randomised   Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01947)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new paradigm for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) based on randomised quantum circuits. Instead of using a fixed parameterised circuit, a distribution of random circuits is generated according to a parameterised guiding function represented by an artificial neural network. A key advantage is the ability to systematically trade off between the expressive power of the variational wavefunction and the time cost for evaluating expectations, controlled by the normalisation factor. In the low time-cost limit, the expressive power matches deterministic circuits. As time cost increases, expressive power monotonically improves. Remarkably, with any fixed circuit ansatz, the variational wavefunction can approximate arbitrary states to arbitrary accuracy given sufficient time cost, as rigorously shown by a universal approximation theorem. These results are further elucidated for variational quantum eigensolvers, deriving analytic relationships between approximation error, time cost and circuit depth. The proposed random circuit VQA approach thus offers a promising route to enhance performance of near-term algorithms while keeping gate counts fixed.
