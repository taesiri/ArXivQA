# [Maximising Quantum-Computing Expressive Power through Randomised   Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01947)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) rely on the expressive power of parameterized quantum circuits to find solutions. However, expressive power is limited by the number of gates that can be reliably executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.  
- Highly expressive circuits also lead to barren plateaus that cause issues during optimization.
- There is a need to improve the expressive power of VQAs without increasing gate count.

Proposed Solution:
- instead of using deterministic circuits, utilize random circuits to generate the variational wavefunction 
- Parameterize the distribution and phase of the random circuits using artificial neural networks (ANNs)
- Optimize the ANN parameters instead of the quantum circuit parameters

Main Contributions:
- This introduces a trade-off between expressive power of the variational wavefunction and the time cost (number of measurements)
- For a fixed gate count, expressive power can be systematically increased by extending the quantum computing time
- In the limit of large permitted time cost, the variational wavefunction can approximate any quantum state with arbitrary accuracy (universal approximation theorem)
- Established quantitative relationships between expressive power, time cost and gate count for using this approach with variational quantum eigensolvers
- Highlighted potential of the random circuit approach to achieve high expressive power despite gate number constraints in NISQ devices

In summary, the paper proposes and analyzes a novel paradigm for VQAs using random circuits that can trade-off between expressive power and time cost. Key results show that this approach can theoretically achieve universal approximation with sufficient time resources even with limited gate counts.
