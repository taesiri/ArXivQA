# [Accelerating Learnt Video Codecs with Gradient Decay and Layer-wise   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02605)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel model-agnostic pruning scheme to reduce the complexity of learned video codecs while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance. The method combines gradient decay, which enhances parameter exploration during sparsification, and adaptive layer-wise distillation, which regulates the sparse training process through staged knowledge transfer from a pre-trained teacher model. The gradient decay technique progressively decays the surrogate gradients of pruned weights over training iterations, allowing more flexibility early on while stabilizing convergence later. The layer-wise distillation splits the distillation of codec sub-modules into stages rather than the pruning itself, thereby implicitly regularizing the global sparsity target. This approach efficiently updates parameters with less overhead. The method is applied to prune the decoders of three learned video codecs - FVC, DCVC, and DCVC-HEM. Results show the compact models can achieve up to 65% reduction in multiply-accumulate operations and 50% lower latency with less than 0.3dB BD-PSNR drop. The performance-complexity trade-off clearly surpasses other pruned models, demonstrating the capability for practical deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a generic workflow to reduce complexity of learned video codecs using gradient decay for improved sparsification and adaptive layer-wise distillation to regularize the training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel model-agnostic pruning scheme for reducing the complexity of end-to-end learned video codecs. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A new gradient approximator called "gradient decay" which enhances parameter exploration during sparsification while preventing runaway sparsity. This is shown to be superior to the commonly used straight-through estimator (STE) for surrogate gradients. 

2) An adaptive layer-wise distillation strategy that regulates the sparse training process through staged feature-level knowledge transfer from a pre-trained teacher model. This improves optimization efficiency with minimal overhead.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed pruning scheme by applying it to three state-of-the-art learned video codecs - FVC, DCVC and DCVC-HEM. Results show the compact models can achieve up to 65% reduction in MACs and 2x speedup with less than 0.3dB BD-PSNR drop.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel pruning workflow leveraging gradient decay and adaptive distillation that can effectively reduce complexity across multiple learned video compression models with minimal impact on rate-distortion performance.

The paper proposes a new complexity reduction approach for pruning end-to-end learned video codecs. The key ideas presented are using gradient decay instead of STE for gradient approximation during pruning, and using an adaptive layer-wise distillation strategy to regularize the pruning process. The techniques are evaluated on three learned video codecs - FVC, DCVC, and DCVC-HEM. The results demonstrate significant reductions in complexity and decoding latency with minimal impact on rate-distortion performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a gradient decay method to approximate gradients for pruned weights instead of using straight-through estimator (STE). How does gradient decay help stabilize training and prevent runaway sparsity compared to STE?

2. The paper mentions the issue of forward-backward mismatching with STE, especially at higher sparsity levels. Explain what causes this mismatch and how gradient decay helps mitigate this issue. 

3. The paper employs a sigmoid scheduler to configure the gradient decay parameter beta. Walk through the details of how this scheduler works and how it enables more exploration early on while stabilizing training later. 

4. Explain the motivation behind using an adaptive layer-wise distillation strategy instead of partitioning the training process into stages when pruning different modules. How does this implicit regularization help?

5. Walk through the details of how the layer-wise distillation loss is calculated in Eq. 6. Why is normalization used before calculating the MSE loss between student and teacher features?

6. The paper uses a decaying schedule for the distillation loss weight Î»3 similar to gradient decay beta. Explain the motivation behind this decay and how it prevents over-compensation.

7. Analyze the results in Table 2 showing the ablation studies. Compare versions 1-4 and discuss the relative impact of gradient decay and layer-wise distillation.  

8. Explain why the decoding latency reduction with pruning is less substantial compared to reductions in parameters and FLOPs. What are some ways this could be further improved?

9. Analyze Fig. 3(c) showing training loss over time. Compare the baseline, GD only, and GD+ALD versions and discuss how each contribution stabilizes training. 

10. The method is model-agnostic and tested on 3 video codecs. Discuss any differences in how the pruning process worked for these codecs and reasons behind similarities/differences in results.
