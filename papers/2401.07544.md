# [See the Unseen: Better Context-Consistent Knowledge-Editing by Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT can recall the same knowledge across different contexts, demonstrating context-consistency. 
- However, existing knowledge editing methods that aim to update the knowledge of LLMs lack generalization across contexts. 
- This is because they edit the knowledge using only a single context prompt, without accounting for the fact that the knowledge needs to be applied consistently across different contexts.

Key Idea: 
- The paper empirically finds that the effects of different contexts on an LLM's recall of the same knowledge follows a Gaussian-like distribution, only causing small shifts in activations.
- Based on this, the paper proposes to add Gaussian noise to the LLM's feedforward network activations during knowledge editing. 
- This simulates the LLM seeing different unseen contexts, improving generalization of the edited knowledge across contexts.

Method:
- The method builds on state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques like ROME and MEMIT that update the feedforward network parameters.
- During editing, Gaussian noise is added to the activations, so the optimized parameters work better across simulated unseen contexts.  
- This "deep noise editing" adds noise across layers, not just the target layer being edited.

Results:
- Experiments on GPT-2, GPT-J and LLaMA editing benchmarks demonstrate clear improvements in generalization with this approach.
- Analysis shows the approach fits knowledge editing better than other noise injection methods like NoisyTune and NEFTune.
- The paper also empirically analyzes LLM knowledge consistency and distinguishes it from other context sensitivities.

Key Contributions:
- Empirical analysis providing insights into knowledge consistency in LLMs, distinguishing it from other context sensitivities.
- Deep noise editing method to improve context generalization of knowledge editing.
- State-of-the-art results on multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrating effectiveness. 
- Analysis distinguishing the approach from other noise injection techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes adding Gaussian noise to feedforward network activations when editing knowledge in large language models, in order to simulate different contexts and improve generalization of the edited knowledge to unseen contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to improve the generalization of knowledge editing for large language models. Specifically:

1) The paper empirically analyzes how different contexts affect the feedforward network activations when recalling the same knowledge, and finds that different contexts induce small shifts to the activations that follow a Gaussian-like distribution. 

2) Motivated by this finding, the paper proposes a "deep noise editing" method which adds Gaussian noise to the feedforward network activations during knowledge editing. This simulates the effect of different contexts to help the model generalize better.

3) Experiments on multiple language models and datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves generalization in knowledge editing, achieving state-of-the-art performance. 

In summary, the key contribution is identifying the effect of different contexts on knowledge recall, and leveraging this effect with a simple noise-based technique to significantly improve generalization in the knowledge editing task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Knowledge-editing - The task of updating the knowledge contained within large language models. A main focus of the paper.

- Context-consistency - The property that language models should be able to recall the same knowledge across different contexts. An important consideration for effective knowledge-editing. 

- Feed-forward networks (FFNs) - A key component of Transformers where knowledge is stored. Analysis of FFN activations is central to the findings.

- Activations - Specifically FFN activations, which show small Gaussian-like shifts for knowledge-related tokens across different contexts. This property motivates the noise-based editing approach. 

- Generalization - A key evaluation metric to test if edited knowledge can be properly recalled across unseen paraphrasing contexts. Improving generalization is a main goal. 

- Noise - Gaussian noise added to FFN activations during editing to simulate different contexts. Allows models to "see the unseen" and improves generalization.

- State-of-the-art methods - Existing advanced knowledge editing techniques like ROME and MEMIT. Used as baselines to demonstrate improved performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper finds that different contexts place small shifts that follow a Gaussian-like distribution on FFN activations for knowledge-related tokens. What evidence supports this finding? How was this distribution analyzed and characterized?

2. The paper proposes adding Gaussian noise to FFN activations during knowledge editing to simulate different contexts. How was the magnitude (Î±) of noise determined? Were different values tested? How sensitive are the results to this hyperparameter? 

3. Deep noise editing involves adding noise to FFNs across multiple layers rather than just the target layer for editing. Why is this more effective? Does the impact vary across different layers?

4. How does the proposed method account for possible conflicts when editing a large number of knowledge items? Could accumulating noise or constraints cause issues? 

5. For comparison methods like NoisyTune and NEFTune, what modifications were made to adapt them for knowledge editing? How were hyperparameters configured?

6. The fluency metric used focuses on ngram diversity rather than semantic coherence. How well does this capture text quality? Could other automatic or human evaluations better measure fluency?

7. The paper shows the method works on GPT-2 and GPT-J. How transferrable is it to other Transformer architectures? What model properties affect its applicability?  

8. What other editing objectives beyond maximizing target token probability could this method be applied to? Could the noise distribution be adapted?

9. The sensitivity analysis for the number of edited items shows diminishing returns. What limits further scaling? Is there a theoretical editing capacity?

10. The paper focuses on editing feed-forward networks, but attention could also be sensitive to context. Could injecting noise during attention improve consistency further?
