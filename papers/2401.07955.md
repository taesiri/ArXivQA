# [A Study on Large Language Models' Limitations in Multiple-Choice   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper analyzes the ability of 26 small open-source language models to properly answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Despite the widespread use of MCQ tests to evaluate language models across various fields, the paper finds that most models struggle to correctly understand and respond to MCQs. 

Methods
The authors test the models using a dataset of 885 statements across 6 categories like facts, conspiracies, controversies etc. with labeled ground truths. They ask the same question in 5 differently worded prompts to elicit MCQ responses from the models. The models are evaluated using text responses as well as a probability-based method. Responses are also checked with randomized choice order to test dependence.

Key Findings
- 65% of models have near zero probability of responding properly, indicating no MCQ task understanding. 
- 70-75% models are choice order dependent, giving unreliable responses. 
- 50-65% models respond 'Yes' most of the time, despite only 5% ground truth being 'Yes'.
- Only 5 models show better performance - 4 Mistral models and vicuna-7b-v1.5.

Conclusions
The paper shows that most small open-source models fail at the MCQ task by not understanding instructions, heavily depending on choice order, or both. This is concerning given the widespread use of MCQ tests across domains to evaluate language models. The paper calls for caution in using MCQ tests for evaluation without proper testing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the performance of 26 small open-source language models on multiple-choice question answering and finds that most models struggle to understand the task, depend too much on choice order, or both.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of 26 small open-source language models on their ability to answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The key findings are:

1) 65% of the models show poor understanding of the MCQ task, evident from extremely low probabilities of responding with one of the choice letters (A, B, C, D) and bad text responses. 

2) 70-75% of the models that did respond properly were choice order dependent - their responses became randomized when the order of choices was randomized. Only 5 models were choice order independent.

3) 50-65% of the models respond mostly with "A" irrespective of the content, indicating they simply choose the first option rather than evaluating the choices.

4) Only 2 models (Mistral-7B-v0.1 and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) successfully answered MCQs without choice order bias and showed good understanding of the task.

In summary, the paper demonstrates significant limitations of small open-source language models in answering MCQs, which is concerning given the widespread use of MCQ tests to evaluate these models. The paper recommends testing for choice order dependence and task understanding before using MCQs with language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Multiple choice questions (MCQs) 
- Open-source models
- Task understanding
- Choice order dependence
- Response distribution
- Instruction following
- Prompt engineering
- Model evaluation

The paper analyzes the performance of 26 open-source LLMs on answering multiple choice questions. It looks at whether these models actually understand the MCQ task, and if their responses depend too much on the order of answer choices provided. The analysis involves using different prompting strategies and evaluation methods to extract and assess the models' responses. The key findings indicate issues with most models' ability to properly respond to and understand the MCQ format, highlighting the need for caution when using such questions to test LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This study analyzes 26 small open-source models on the task of multiple-choice question answering. What were the key criteria used to select these specific models and what are some limitations of the model set chosen?

2. Two main approaches are used to extract responses from models - parsed text responses and a probability-based method. Can you elaborate on the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach? Under what conditions would one be favored over the other?  

3. The paper concludes that most models either fail to understand the MCQ task or are too dependent on choice order. What specifically in the results led to these conclusions? Could there be alternative explanations for some of the observed behavior?

4. Prompt wording and format is known to significantly impact model responses. How might the prompts used in this study, though simple, still bias models unfairly? What variations could be tested?

5. The ground truths for the statements were manually labeled. What quality control processes were used to ensure accurate labeling? How might subtle ambiguities in statements affect conclusions?  

6. Beyond choice order randomization, what other techniques could be used to further analyze or improve model robustness in MCQ answering? 

7. The fictional statements have a unique dual ground truth. How were the prompts for these specialized to handle the "true in fiction" case? Could this category warrant even more customized handling?

8. What other proxy metrics beside aggregated probability over the choice tokens could indicate MCQ task understanding? What are the tradeoffs?

9. The paper recommends caution when using MCQ to assess Language Models. What guidelines would you propose before deploying MCQ evaluation of models in real-world settings?  

10. What mechanisms fundamentally differentiate human and model learning of the MCQ format? Could insights from this differential inform approaches to improve model instruction tuning?
