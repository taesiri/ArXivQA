# [RGBD GS-ICP SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent dense SLAM methods utilizing neural scene representations like NeRF have high fidelity but slow rendering speed. Methods using 3D Gaussian representation are fast but do not fully leverage the 3D information.
- Existing methods either completely decouple tracking and mapping leading to redundancy or couple them loosely leading to slow speed. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a coupled dense SLAM system fusing Generalized ICP (G-ICP) for tracking and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mapping.
- Leverage a single Gaussian map for both tracking and mapping to enable tight coupling and mutual benefits.
- Share covariances between G-ICP and 3DGS to minimize computations. G-ICP tracking outputs are used to initialize 3DGS mapping.
- Employ techniques like scale regularization, alignment and keyframe selection to enhance performance.

Main Contributions:
- Extremely fast dense SLAM system (107 FPS) with superior map quality by fusing G-ICP and 3DGS.
- Actively utilizes 3D information for tracking via G-ICP instead of 2D photometric errors.
- Minimizes computations by sharing a single Gaussian map and alignments between tracking and mapping.  
- Enhances tracking and mapping quality through proposed techniques like scale alignment and keyframe selection.
- State-of-the-art performance on standard datasets in speed, tracking accuracy and map quality.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel dense SLAM system by effectively fusing G-ICP and 3DGS in a coupled manner to achieve fast speed along with high map fidelity and tracking accuracy.
