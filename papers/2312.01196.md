# [Neural Parametric Gaussians for Monocular Non-Rigid Object   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes with complex, non-rigid motion in novel views is challenging. Previous methods for neural radiance fields (NeRF) of dynamic scenes either require strong per-frame supervision or sacrifice quality. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes the Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (D-NeRF) method to represent complex deforming objects from only a set of posed 2D images. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the deforming object as a template point model that deforms over time according to a learned deformation field modeled by a deformation basis. This provides strong regularization for novel view synthesis while still allowing non-rigid motions.

2) Employ a segmented volume with oriented 3D Gaussians centered at each point to represent appearance and geometry. The volume deforms over time based on the predicted deformation basis coefficients.

3) A two-stage optimization procedure that first fits the deformation model to the input views using various losses, and then refines the template shape for better consistency across time.

Main Contributions:

- First method to represent highly complex non-rigid motion for novel view synthesis with only 2D supervision at training time.

- Deformation model with oriented 3D Gaussians provides regularization while allowing detailed surface geometry.  

- Demonstrates high-quality novel view synthesis on dynamic objects undergoing challenging motions on both synthetic and real datasets.

- Extensive experiments and ablation studies analyzing the design choices and comparing to other state-of-the-art dynamic scene representations.

In summary, the key innovation is the deformation model that enables representing complex motions from 2D images only, leading to high-quality renderings of dynamic scenes in novel views.
