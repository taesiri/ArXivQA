# [A slice classification neural network for automated classification of   axial PET/CT slices from a multi-centric lymphoma dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manual segmentation of tumors from whole-body PET/CT images is time-consuming and operator-dependent. Automated slice classification can help direct physicians' attention to important slices.
- Prior work trained a slice classifier on a small uni-centric dataset. This work aims to train and validate a classifier on a larger multi-centric dataset.

Methods:
- Lymphoma PET/CT images were collected from 246 patients from Vancouver (BCCV) and 220 patients from Seoul (SMHS). Tumors were annotated by nuclear medicine physicians.
- Axial slices were labeled as positive (containing tumor) or negative (no tumor). Class imbalance was 8:92% for BCCV and 21:79% for SMHS.  
- A ResNet-18 network was trained for binary slice classification. Data was split either by slices (slice-level) or patients (patient-level) into train and test sets.
- Models were trained in a center-aware (CAW) manner on BCCV or center-agnostic (CAG) manner on both centers. Inputs contained either only PET or PET+CT slices.

Key Results:
- Slice-level splitting causes performance overestimation due to lack of independence between train and test slices. Patient-level splitting is better.
- Including SMHS data in CAG training improves generalization over CAW training.
- PET+CT inputs did not improve performance over PET alone.
- Models achieve high specificity, but sensitivity depends on tumor SUVmax.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated importance of patient-level split for valid evaluation of slice classifiers.
- Showed that multi-centric datasets require center-agnostic training for better generalization.
- Analyzed dependence of classification performance on tumor SUVmax.
- Provided guidelines for training generalized lymphoma slice classifiers.

In summary, the key novelty of this work is studying slice classification on a multi-centric dataset and analyzing different data splitting and training strategies to improve generalization of classifiers. The analysis of classification performance vs. tumor SUVmax is also an important contribution.
