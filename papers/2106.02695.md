# [Meta-Learning with Fewer Tasks through Task Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02695)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research question this paper tries to address is: How to improve the generalization ability and reduce overfitting of meta-learning algorithms, especially when the number of meta-training tasks is limited?The paper proposes a new task augmentation strategy called MLTI (Meta-Learning with Task Interpolation) to address this question. The key idea is to densify the task distribution by interpolating between existing meta-training tasks to generate additional "synthetic" tasks. The central hypothesis is that by using MLTI to interpolate between meta-training tasks, the model will be exposed to a more dense sampling of tasks during training. This will act as an implicit regularization and enable the model to generalize better to new unseen tasks during meta-testing.The authors evaluate MLTI on a diverse set of meta-learning benchmarks and show it consistently outperforms prior regularization techniques for meta-learning. They also provide theoretical analysis to show how MLTI corresponds to an implicit regularization.In summary, the key research question is how to improve generalization in meta-learning with limited tasks, and the central hypothesis is that task interpolation via MLTI acts as an effective regularizer to address this challenge. The empirical and theoretical results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new task augmentation method called MLTI (Meta-Learning with Task Interpolation) that generates additional tasks by interpolating between pairs of existing meta-training tasks. This helps densify the task distribution when only limited meta-training tasks are available. 2. It provides theoretical analysis showing that MLTI induces an implicit regularization effect and improves the generalization performance of both gradient-based and metric-based meta-learning algorithms.3. It empirically evaluates MLTI on diverse few-shot classification tasks across different domains (image recognition, pose prediction, molecule property prediction, medical image classification). The results demonstrate that MLTI consistently improves the performance of various meta-learning algorithms, especially when the number of meta-training tasks is small.4. It shows that MLTI is compatible with different meta-learning algorithms like MAML, Prototypical Networks, Meta-SGD, ANIL etc. and can be combined with other regularization techniques like MetaMix and Meta-Dropout.In summary, the key novelty is the idea of generating new tasks by interpolating existing tasks, which helps regularize meta-learning models for better generalization under limited training tasks. Both theoretical and empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple but powerful idea.
