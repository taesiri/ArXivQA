# [METAL: Metamorphic Testing Framework for Analyzing Large-Language Model   Qualities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06056)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a Metamorphic Testing (MT) framework called METAL for systematically evaluating the quality attributes of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as robustness, fairness, non-determinism, and efficiency. The framework defines Metamorphic Relation (MR) templates covering combinations of quality attributes and tasks in LLMs, and then automatically generates hundreds of MRs using textual perturbation functions. The MR satisfaction is evaluated using the Attack Success Rate metric combined with semantic similarity metrics. Experiments conducted on GooglePaLM, ChatGPT, and Llama2 demonstrate METAL's effectiveness in revealing quality risks of LLMs - GooglePaLM outperforms others, while Llama2 shows more fluctuating results. The framework also identifies the most effective MRs for testing each LLM task. A key finding is that character and word-level perturbations work best for classification and generative tasks respectively. The feasibility of self/cross-examination of LLMs using the framework is also validated, with ChatGPT generating the most effective MRs overall. The modular and automated nature of METAL provides a systematic LLM testing approach adaptable across quality attributes, tasks, and models.
