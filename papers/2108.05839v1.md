# [Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05839v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper appears to address the following main research questions:1. How can we improve the generalization performance and adaptivity of deep neural networks trained with gradient-based optimizers? 2. Can controlling the growth of network weights and logits during training lead to better generalization?3. Can weight normalization techniques be effectively combined with existing optimizers like SGD and Adam to improve their performance across tasks and batch sizes?The central hypothesis seems to be that constraining the norms of the weights in the final layers of the network during training can help avoid the issues of loss flattening and loss of adaptivity. This technique, called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), is proposed as a way to make deep networks more adaptive and better at escaping suboptimal minima during training. The paper develops LAWN and combines it with SGD, Adam and LAMB optimizers. Through extensive experiments on image classification and recommendation tasks, it demonstrates that LAWN variants of these optimizers show improved generalization ability compared to the base optimizers, especially for large batch sizes. The results indicate that controlling network weight growth and attenuating logits during training helps improve optimizer performance across applications.In summary, the main research questions addressed are around developing a practical weight normalization technique to improve adaptivity and generalization of neural network training, and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness when combined with popular optimizers like Adam and SGD.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN) as a method to improve generalization performance of neural networks trained with gradient-based optimization. Here are the key contributions:- Identifies the issue of loss flattening and loss of adaptivity during unregularized training of overparameterized networks, which hurts generalization. This happens when logits and network weights grow large, making the loss and gradients very small. - Proposes LAWN as a simple technique to constrain the growth of logits and network weights. The key ideas are:  - Train initially without constraints   - At some point, fix the weight norms of layers to their current values  - Continue training using projected gradients that only have lateral components  - This makes training more adaptive and approximate implicit bias- Demonstrates LAWN improves performance of SGD, Adam, LAMB across diverse tasks like image classification and recommendation. Key results:  - Adam-LAWN achieves 76% accuracy on ImageNet, first result showing Adam working well for image classification  - LAWN enables current optimizers to work well at large batch sizes  - Outperforms other techniques like weight decay and label smoothing- Provides theoretical justification showing LAWN relates to implicit bias and margin maximization for homogeneous networks.In summary, the paper identifies an important problem with unregularized training, and proposes a simple and effective technique LAWN that works with any optimizer, task and batch size. It gives strong empirical evidence and some theory to back the technique.
