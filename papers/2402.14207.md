# [Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Generating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch is challenging because it requires thorough research and planning in a pre-writing stage before the actual writing. However, prior work on Wikipedia article generation has bypassed this pre-writing stage by either assuming reference documents are provided or an outline is already available. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes STORM, a writing system that automates the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives to research the topic, (2) simulating conversations where different personas ask questions grounded in reliable online sources, and (3) curating the collected information into an article outline.

Key Contributions:
- Curates the FreshWiki dataset of recent, high-quality Wikipedia articles to avoid data leakage issues.
- Defines metrics to evaluate outline quality against human-written articles to facilitate studying the pre-writing stage.  
- STORM outperforms baselines in both automatic metrics and reviews by experienced Wikipedia editors, especially in breadth and organization of articles.
- Editor feedback reveals new challenges like source bias transfer and associating unrelated facts, presenting areas for future work in grounded writing.

In summary, the paper explores generating full-length Wikipedia-like articles from scratch, with a novel system called STORM that focuses on automating the demanding pre-writing stage. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling human information seeking behavior for grounded writing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes STORM, a system that automates the pre-writing stage for generating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch by using large language models to research topics through perspective-guided question asking and conversations grounded on the internet, then curating the collected information into an outline to write the full article.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing STORM, a writing system that automates the pre-writing stage for generating long-form Wikipedia-like articles from scratch. Specifically, STORM researches a given topic by discovering diverse perspectives to ask effective questions in simulated conversations, and uses the information collected to create a comprehensive outline. The paper also contributes the FreshWiki dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles and metrics to evaluate outline quality. Through experiments, both automatic metrics and feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors demonstrate STORM's effectiveness over baseline methods, especially regarding the breadth and organization of generated articles. The paper also discusses new challenges identified by expert evaluators, such as addressing bias transfer from Internet sources and preventing over-association between unrelated facts.

- Outline creation
- Question asking 
- Perspective-guided question asking
- Simulated conversations
- Information retrieval
- Reference grounding
- FreshWiki dataset
- Outline quality evaluation

The paper proposes a system called STORM to assist in generating long, Wikipedia-style articles from scratch. A key focus is on automating the pre-writing stage which involves researching a topic and preparing an outline. The system discovers perspectives to guide question asking to an expert grounded in online sources, simulates conversations, and curates the information into an outline. Experiments using automatic metrics and human evaluations by Wikipedia editors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and reveal new challenges like source bias transfer.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does STORM identify diverse perspectives when researching a topic? What are the potential limitations of only using existing Wikipedia articles to discover perspectives?

2. When simulating conversations between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert, how does STORM ensure the questions asked are non-repetitive and build on previous information gained? 

3. What mechanisms does STORM use to break down complex questions into simpler search queries? How does it handle questions with no direct answer online?

4. How does STORM evaluate and filter sources from search results to ensure only trustworthy information is used? What criteria guide this process?  

5. In curating the final outline, why does STORM first ask the LLM to generate a draft outline before refining it based on the simulated conversations?

6. What is the rationale behind personifying the LLM with specific perspectives during the question asking process? How might this compare to question asking without explicit perspectives?

7. When expanding the outline into a full article, how does STORM determine semantic similarity to retrieve relevant passages from the collected references?

8. What measures does STORM take to improve coherence when concatenating text generated section-by-section into the final article?

9. How might the parameters of maximum perspectives N and maximum conversation rounds M impact the breadth and depth of STORM's research on a topic? 

10. What customizations would be needed to port STORM's approach to languages other than English? How might the availability of references differ across languages?
