# [Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Generating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch is challenging because it requires thorough research and planning in a pre-writing stage before the actual writing. However, prior work on Wikipedia article generation has bypassed this pre-writing stage by either assuming reference documents are provided or an outline is already available. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes STORM, a writing system that automates the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives to research the topic, (2) simulating conversations where different personas ask questions grounded in reliable online sources, and (3) curating the collected information into an article outline.

Key Contributions:
- Curates the FreshWiki dataset of recent, high-quality Wikipedia articles to avoid data leakage issues.
- Defines metrics to evaluate outline quality against human-written articles to facilitate studying the pre-writing stage.  
- STORM outperforms baselines in both automatic metrics and reviews by experienced Wikipedia editors, especially in breadth and organization of articles.
- Editor feedback reveals new challenges like source bias transfer and associating unrelated facts, presenting areas for future work in grounded writing.

In summary, the paper explores generating full-length Wikipedia-like articles from scratch, with a novel system called STORM that focuses on automating the demanding pre-writing stage. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling human information seeking behavior for grounded writing.
