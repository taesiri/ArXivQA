## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a distributed cooperative routing framework for CNC systems to ensure deadline requirements and minimize computation cost of requests.
- Framework includes trading plane, management plane, control plane and forwarding plane.
- Cross-plane cooperative end-to-end routing schemes consider both computation efficiency of heterogeneous servers and network congestion degrees while making routing plans.

Key Contributions:
- Illustrates importance of developing CNC through analysis of social, commercial and technological forces.
- Studies CNC connotation from perspectives of definition and convergence levels. 
- Proposes novel routing framework to support end-to-end deadline-aware computing request routing to empower CNC development.

- Conducts simulations to showcase capacity of proposed routing framework to ensure deadlines and reduce costs.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel cooperative routing framework to achieve end-to-end optimized scheduling of computing requests in CNC systems, through cross-plane cooperation that considers computation efficiency, network congestion, deadline guarantees and cost reduction. Simulations validate the performance.

It focuses on routing computing requests in an end-to-end manner with consideration of computation efficiency, network congestion, and deadline requirements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a distributed cooperative routing framework with four planes. Can you explain the key functions of each plane and how they work together to enable the end-to-end routing of computing requests? 

2. The global system view maintenance is critical for enabling optimized routing decisions. Can you elaborate on the cross-plane cooperation involved in maintaining an accurate, real-time global system view?

3. The paper claims the proposed routing approach ensures both the functional and deadline requirements of computing requests. Can you walk through how these requirements are considered when making routing decisions? 

4. When determining feasibility of routing solutions, the paper mentions evaluating execution time on nodes and predicting transmission time on paths. What factors are considered when making these evaluations and predictions?

5. Once a cost-friendly routing solution is selected, how is the original request broken down and distributed across the network to meet the functional and deadline constraints? 

6. The simulation results show improved performance over a "computing first" routing approach. Can you analyze the key differences between the approaches and why considering both computation and network factors is beneficial?

7. The proposed framework involves various data plane and control plane interactions. Can you describe some of the key data flows and signaling involved in the end-to-end routing process? 

8. How does the framework handle dynamic changes in network conditions or node capabilities when routing requests? Does it reevaluate decisions mid-execution?

9. The convergence levels in Section III distinguish between resource, function, and performance requirements. How does the framework handle and route requests at each of these convergence levels? 

10. What other metrics beyond cost and deadline success could be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed routing framework? How might the design be tailored to optimize for other objectives?
