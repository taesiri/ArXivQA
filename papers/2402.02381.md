# [Empowering Computing and Networks Convergence System with Distributed   Cooperative Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02381)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emergence of intelligent applications and advances in computing and networks are driving the development of computing and networks convergence (CNC) systems. 
- Existing research fails to achieve comprehensive scheduling optimization of computing and network resources, unable to guarantee requirements of computing requests in an end-to-end service pattern. This negatively impacts CNC system development.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a distributed cooperative routing framework for CNC systems to ensure deadline requirements and minimize computation cost of requests.
- Framework includes trading plane, management plane, control plane and forwarding plane.
- Cross-plane cooperative end-to-end routing schemes consider both computation efficiency of heterogeneous servers and network congestion degrees while making routing plans.

Key Contributions:
- Illustrates importance of developing CNC through analysis of social, commercial and technological forces.
- Studies CNC connotation from perspectives of definition and convergence levels. 
- Proposes novel routing framework to support end-to-end deadline-aware computing request routing to empower CNC development.
- Deeply analyzes seamless end-to-end request routing scheme for distributed cooperation, deadline awareness and cost optimization.
- Conducts simulations to showcase capacity of proposed routing framework to ensure deadlines and reduce costs.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel cooperative routing framework to achieve end-to-end optimized scheduling of computing requests in CNC systems, through cross-plane cooperation that considers computation efficiency, network congestion, deadline guarantees and cost reduction. Simulations validate the performance.
