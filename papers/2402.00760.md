# [EuroPED-NN: Uncertainty aware surrogate model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Plasma pedestal models like EuroPED and EPED are computationally expensive to run, limiting their use in iterative applications like scenario optimization. 
- Thus, there is a need to develop faster surrogate models that can accurately emulate the pedestal models.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop a surrogate model called EuroPED-NN using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) trained with the Noise Contrastive Prior (NCP) technique. 
- BNN-NCP provides uncertainties on predictions, distinguishing epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) and aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty).
- Loss function tailored to leverage uncertainties to detect interpolation vs extrapolation and enhance model robustness.  

Contributions:
- Demonstrated BNN-NCP as an effective uncertainty-aware technique for emulating plasma physics models.
- EuroPED-NN matches EuroPED outputs within 7% error and replicates key pedestal physics like the $\Delta$-$\beta_{p,ped}$ relation.
- Uncertainty estimates clearly detect extrapolation and track input noise propagation.
- Showed model limitations by training on experimental data directly, motivating further pedestal characterization.
- Framework is adaptable to other plasma models like EPED.
- Computationally efficient surrogate enables applications needing faster evaluations.

In summary, the paper presents a detailed methodology to construct a fast yet accurate surrogate model for plasma pedestals using BNN-NCP, highlighted by uncertainty information to judge reliability, limitations, and generalizability. The framework shows promise for accelerating integrated modeling workflows by replacing expensive physics-based models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a Bayesian neural network with noise contrastive prior (BNN-NCP) to build a fast surrogate model of the EuroPED pedestal prediction tool, demonstrating good accuracy while enabling uncertainty quantification to highlight model limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It successfully generates uncertainty aware surrogate models of the EuroPED plasma pedestal model using Bayesian neural networks with noise contrastive prior (BNN-NCP). The BNN-NCP technique is shown to be effective for uncertainty quantification in surrogate models.

2) The surrogate model, EuroPED-NN, matches the output results of EuroPED while providing predictions' confidence in the form of uncertainties. It highlights out-of-distribution regions using the surrogate model uncertainties, providing insights into model robustness.

3) EuroPED-NN is physically validated by analyzing the electron density with respect to plasma current, and by validating the Δ-βp,ped relation from EuroPED. This affirms the robustness of the underlying physics learned by the surrogate model.

In summary, the main contribution is using BNN-NCP to develop an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for the EuroPED pedestal model, with additional analysis to verify and characterize its performance. The methodology could be applied to other plasma physics models as well.

The paper focuses on developing a fast surrogate model of the EuroPED plasma pedestal model using Bayesian neural networks trained with the noise contrastive prior technique. Key goals are accelerating the model for applications like scenario optimization, exploring uncertainties, and verifying that key pedestal physics relationships are preserved. The method allows quantifying different sources of uncertainty and detecting when inputs are out of the distribution of the training data. Overall, it provides a way to create a fast, probabilistic version of the EuroPED model that can provide estimates of predictive confidence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The BNN-NCP loss function has various components like NLL and KL divergence terms. How were the weights assigned to these components and how does changing these weights impact model performance? What is the logic behind the current weight choices?

2. The epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties predicted by the model depend on certain prior distributions defined by the user. What is the sensitivity of these predictions to changes in the parameters (like standard deviation) that define these prior distributions? 

3. How was the architecture (number of layers, neurons etc.) of the neural network optimized? Was any architecture search method used and what were the criteria used to select the final architecture?

4. The input features were transformed to dimensionless quantities before feeding to the model. What is the impact of this transformation on the uncertainty predictions? Does it improve extrapolation capabilities?

5. What variations were tested for sampling the out-of-distribution input points? How sensitive are the uncertainty predictions to the scale of noise used for OOD sampling? 

6. The model accuracy seems lower for predicting pedestal width compared to density and temperature. Does this imply higher complexity or nonlinearity associated with width prediction? How can the performance be improved?

7. The experimental model performance is much lower compared to EuroPED model performance. Does this highlight any limitation of inputs used? What modifications can be made to inputs to improve experimental model performance?  

8. How well does the uncertainty increase when inputs move away from regions dense with training data points? Is the increase gradual or rapid? How can coverage of uncertainty predictions be improved?

9. For real-time applications, what is the inference time for the EuroPED surrogate? How does it compare against the actual EuroPED model inference time?

10. What additional verifications can be performed to validate uncertainty predictions from the model besides the out-of-distribution analysis presented? Are there ways to get experimental uncertainty measurements?
