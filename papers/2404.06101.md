# [Making Old Kurdish Publications Processable by Augmenting Available   Optical Character Recognition Engines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is a vast collection of historical Kurdish publications in libraries that still need processing to make them accessible and usable. However, these documents have many issues like damaged pages, non-standard fonts, etc that make it very difficult to extract text from them automatically using standard OCR systems designed for clean modern documents. 

- Currently no publicly available dataset or OCR system exists that can handle these old Kurdish documents printed before 1950 and extract text accurately from them. This severely limits processing capabilities for these invaluable records of Kurdish history and heritage.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors adopt Tesseract, an open-source OCR framework by Google that has shown success for various languages, and enhance it for old Kurdish documents.

- They collect 1233 lines of text and images from Kurdish books and publications printed before 1950 from the Zheen research center. This serves as the dataset.

- They manually transcribe each text line image to create the ground truth. Preprocessing steps like binarization, skew correction etc. are done.

- Using this dataset, they retrain Tesseract's Arabic model to create an OCR tailored for old Kurdish scripts.

Results:
- The trained model achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.755% on Tesseract's evaluation. On a separate test set, Ocreval tool gives an average character accuracy of 84.02%.

- A web application is also created to allow users to input Kurdish document images and extract text using the trained OCR model.

Contributions:
- First known effort to develop an OCR system specifically for old Kurdish print documents.

- Compiled and published first dataset of 1233 text line images from early Kurdish publications with manual transcriptions.

- Showcased enhancing Tesseract for a low-resource language using limited training data. The OCR model while still needing improvement shows promising accuracy.

- Developed a web application to demonstrate text extraction capabilities for Kurdish libraries and researchers.

The paper discusses limitations like requiring more data, challenges in space alignment etc. Future work is suggested to address these and continue improving the OCR system's accuracy.
