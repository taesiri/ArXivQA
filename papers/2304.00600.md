# [Recurrence without Recurrence: Stable Video Landmark Detection with Deep   Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00600)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can deep equilibrium models be adapted and utilized for facial landmark detection, particularly for improving temporal coherence in facial landmark detection on videos?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Deep equilibrium models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for facial landmark detection on images by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem.

2) Deep equilibrium models are particularly well-suited for facial landmark detection in videos because their formulation allows modifying the objective function at test time to improve temporal coherence, even without having access to video data at training time. This "recurrence without recurrence" approach can reduce flickering/oscillations in landmarks across video frames.

3) A new dataset and evaluation metric focused on temporal coherence are needed to properly benchmark video facial landmark detection models.

In summary, the central research direction is exploring how to adapt deep equilibrium models for facial landmark detection, with a focus on leveraging their formulation to improve temporal coherence for video landmark detection. The key hypotheses are that deep equilibrium models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on images and that their formulation enables improving video coherence through modifying the objective at test time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new facial landmark detection model called Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) based on Deep Equilibrium Models. The LDEQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WFLW facial landmark dataset while having lower parameters and constant memory cost compared to prior cascaded models like Stacked Hourglass.

2. Introducing a new paradigm called "Recurrence without Recurrence" (RwR) that leverages the flexibility of DEQs to modify the objective function at test time. Specifically, RwR adds a temporal coherence loss at inference to reduce landmark flickering in videos, despite only having access to images during training.

3. Contributing a new facial landmark video dataset called WFLW-Video (WFLW-V) to benchmark temporal coherence. The dataset has 1000 creative commons YouTube videos with dense 98-point annotations. A new metric called Normalized Mean Flicker (NMF) is also introduced to specifically measure landmark flickering.

4. Demonstrating superior performance of LDEQ+RwR in reducing flickering on WFLW-V compared to conventional post-processing filters like exponential moving average. RwR decreases NMF by 13% while maintaining landmark accuracy.

In summary, the key innovations are a new state-of-the-art facial landmark model using DEQs, a technique to leverage DEQs for video coherence without video training data, a new benchmark for facial landmark videos, and strong experimental results validating these contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new deep equilibrium model for facial landmark detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset and also demonstrates improved temporal coherence on videos by modifying the model's objective function at test time to add a recurrence loss.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this CVPR 2022 paper to other research in facial landmark detection:

- It adapts the idea of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) to facial landmark detection, which is a novel application of this type of model. DEQs have only recently been explored for computer vision tasks.

- The proposed Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) model achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset, outperforming prior art like Stacked Hourglass networks. This demonstrates the potential of DEQs for this task.

- A key benefit of the LDEQ approach is the constant memory cost during training, as opposed to the linear increase typically seen with iterative refinement models like Stacked Hourglass. This could make it more scalable.

- The paper introduces a new concept called "Recurrence without Recurrence" (RwR) to leverage temporal information at test time, despite only having trained on images. This improves video stability without compromising accuracy.

- RwR and the overall DEQ approach contrasts with prior techniques like RNNs or deep filtering that have been applied to enhance video stability. The constraints of the DEQ formulation allow new types of test-time optimization.

- The paper includes introduction of a new facial video dataset called WFLW-V to benchmark temporal stability. This helps address the lack of high-quality video data in this field.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of DEQs for facial analysis tasks through strong empirical results. The RwR concept also highlights the flexibility of DEQs for test-time optimization in video settings. It represents innovative use of DEQs compared to prior computer vision papers.
