# [Recurrence without Recurrence: Stable Video Landmark Detection with Deep   Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00600)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can deep equilibrium models be adapted and utilized for facial landmark detection, particularly for improving temporal coherence in facial landmark detection on videos?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Deep equilibrium models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for facial landmark detection on images by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem.

2) Deep equilibrium models are particularly well-suited for facial landmark detection in videos because their formulation allows modifying the objective function at test time to improve temporal coherence, even without having access to video data at training time. This "recurrence without recurrence" approach can reduce flickering/oscillations in landmarks across video frames.

3) A new dataset and evaluation metric focused on temporal coherence are needed to properly benchmark video facial landmark detection models.

In summary, the central research direction is exploring how to adapt deep equilibrium models for facial landmark detection, with a focus on leveraging their formulation to improve temporal coherence for video landmark detection. The key hypotheses are that deep equilibrium models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on images and that their formulation enables improving video coherence through modifying the objective at test time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new facial landmark detection model called Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) based on Deep Equilibrium Models. The LDEQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WFLW facial landmark dataset while having lower parameters and constant memory cost compared to prior cascaded models like Stacked Hourglass.

2. Introducing a new paradigm called "Recurrence without Recurrence" (RwR) that leverages the flexibility of DEQs to modify the objective function at test time. Specifically, RwR adds a temporal coherence loss at inference to reduce landmark flickering in videos, despite only having access to images during training.

3. Contributing a new facial landmark video dataset called WFLW-Video (WFLW-V) to benchmark temporal coherence. The dataset has 1000 creative commons YouTube videos with dense 98-point annotations. A new metric called Normalized Mean Flicker (NMF) is also introduced to specifically measure landmark flickering.

4. Demonstrating superior performance of LDEQ+RwR in reducing flickering on WFLW-V compared to conventional post-processing filters like exponential moving average. RwR decreases NMF by 13% while maintaining landmark accuracy.

In summary, the key innovations are a new state-of-the-art facial landmark model using DEQs, a technique to leverage DEQs for video coherence without video training data, a new benchmark for facial landmark videos, and strong experimental results validating these contributions.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing a better understanding of the properties and behaviors of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) for computer vision tasks. The authors note there is still limited understanding of the desired properties for the function f in DEQs for machine learning.

- Exploring other potential uses of the Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) paradigm. The authors propose RwR as a way to leverage new information at test time that wasn't available at training. They suggest this approach could be applicable to other settings besides just temporal coherence in videos. 

- Applying DEQs to other video analysis tasks besides just facial landmark detection. The authors specifically mention optical flow estimation as one area where DEQs have shown promise. Expanding the use of DEQs for other video tasks could be beneficial.

- Developing better techniques for guaranteeing uniqueness and convergence of equilibriums in DEQs. The authors note current methods often come at a cost of reduced performance. New techniques that provide guarantees without compromising accuracy could further improve DEQs.

- Creating additional labeled video datasets for facial landmark detection. The authors created the WFLW-V dataset, but note the general lack of quality annotated video data. More diverse and extensive labeled video data could enable better development and evaluation of video-based landmark detection.

- Continuing to improve occlusion robustness, which remains a key challenge in facial landmark detection according to the authors. Techniques that can maintain accuracy and coherence for occluded landmarks could significantly advance the field.

In summary, key directions include better understanding DEQ behaviors, expanding RwR applications, applying DEQs to new video tasks, improving DEQ theory, collecting more video data, and handling occlusion robustly. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda around DEQs and video-based landmark detection.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a facial landmark detection model called Landmark Deep Equilibrium Model (LDEQ) which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset. LDEQ adapts the Deep Equilibrium Model framework to facial landmark detection by representing the landmarks as heatmaps and iteratively refining them to convergence using an hourglass module at each stage. A key benefit of LDEQ is that it has a constant memory cost regardless of the number of refinement stages, unlike typical cascaded models. The authors also propose a Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) method to improve temporal coherence of landmarks in video by modifying the LDEQ objective at test time to include a loss that encourages smoothness across frames. They demonstrate improved landmark stability on a new proposed dataset WFLW-V without compromising accuracy. Overall, the work shows the promise of deep equilibrium models for facial landmark detection and introduces an approach to leverage model dynamics at test time to improve video stability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes adapting Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) to the task of facial landmark detection. The authors' Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset, reaching 3.92 NME with fewer parameters and lower memory costs compared to previous cascaded models. By framing DEQs as constrained optimization problems, the model enjoys several benefits including natural early stopping and the ability to modify the objective function at test time. 

The authors also demonstrate the benefits of using LDEQ models for landmark detection in videos. Typically models are trained only on images despite being applied on videos, resulting in "flickering" landmarks between frames. By adding a temporal coherence loss at test time, the authors' Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) approach reduces landmark flicker without compromising accuracy. They introduce a new facial landmark video dataset (WFLW-V) and metric (NMF) for benchmarking. Experiments show LDEQ with RwR improves NME and NMF compared to standard filtering techniques. Overall, the work highlights the potential of DEQ models for computer vision tasks, especially where cascade-style computation or test-time adaptation is beneficial.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes adapting Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) to the task of facial landmark detection. The authors' Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) model represents landmark heatmaps as the equilibrium point of an iterative refinement process defined by a Hourglass network. By exploiting the implicit function theorem to differentiate through the equilibrium solving process, LDEQs can be trained end-to-end while enjoying constant memory cost. The authors further propose a Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) approach to leverage the equilibrium formulation at test time on videos. Since DEQs have no guarantees on solution uniqueness, a temporal coherence loss can be added during inference to reduce landmark flickering across video frames. This is done by initializing the equilibrium solver with the previous frame's solution, and early stopping. The proposed LDEQ with RwR approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WFLW facial landmark dataset, and improved temporal coherence on the authors' new WFLW-Video dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of temporal inconsistency (flickering) in facial landmark detection on videos, when models are trained on still images. 

The key points are:

- Facial landmark detection models are typically trained on still images, but applied on videos at test time. This can lead to flickering of predictions when the face landmarks are ambiguous or uncertain.

- Existing methods to reduce flickering, like smoothing filters, often degrade accuracy. The paper proposes a new method to reduce flicker without hurting accuracy.

- The paper adapts Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) to facial landmark detection, showing they can reach state-of-the-art accuracy on standard datasets. 

- DEQs solve for an objective function during the forward pass. The paper proposes modifying this objective at test time to include a "recurrence" loss that penalizes prediction changes between frames. This encourages temporal coherence.

- They call this Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) since it adds recurrence at test time without seeing videos during training.

- Experiments on a new contributed video dataset (WFLW-V) show RwR reduces flickering more than conventional filters, without degrading landmark accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is using the flexibility of DEQs to add a recurrence objective at test time that improves video temporal coherence, a problem arising from the common practice of training on images and testing on videos.
