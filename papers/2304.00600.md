# [Recurrence without Recurrence: Stable Video Landmark Detection with Deep   Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00600)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can deep equilibrium models be adapted and utilized for facial landmark detection, particularly for improving temporal coherence in facial landmark detection on videos?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Deep equilibrium models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for facial landmark detection on images by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem.

2) Deep equilibrium models are particularly well-suited for facial landmark detection in videos because their formulation allows modifying the objective function at test time to improve temporal coherence, even without having access to video data at training time. This "recurrence without recurrence" approach can reduce flickering/oscillations in landmarks across video frames.

3) A new dataset and evaluation metric focused on temporal coherence are needed to properly benchmark video facial landmark detection models.

In summary, the central research direction is exploring how to adapt deep equilibrium models for facial landmark detection, with a focus on leveraging their formulation to improve temporal coherence for video landmark detection. The key hypotheses are that deep equilibrium models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on images and that their formulation enables improving video coherence through modifying the objective at test time.
