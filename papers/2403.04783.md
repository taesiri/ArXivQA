# [AutoDefense: Multi-Agent LLM Defense against Jailbreak Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04783)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes AutoDefense, a multi-agent framework with specialized LLM agents to collaboratively analyze responses and filter harmful content from language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AutoDefense, a multi-agent defense framework to defend against jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- AutoDefense employs a response-filtering mechanism using multiple LLM agents with specialized roles to analyze potentially harmful content and determine if an LLM response should be filtered out. This doesn't require altering user inputs.

- The framework divides the defense task into intention analysis, prompt inferring, and final judgment sub-tasks. Assigning these to different agents allows each one to focus on specific instructions for its role. 

- AutoDefense is flexible to work with various open-source LLMs as agents. Experiments show a 3-agent AutoDefense system with only LLaMA-2-13b can effectively reduce attack success rates of jailbreaks on GPT-3.5 while maintaining performance on normal user requests.

- The framework is expandable to incorporate additional defense components like Llama Guard as custom agents, further improving defense capabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing AutoDefense, a novel multi-agent response-filtering based defense that is model-agnostic, effective against jailbreaks, and flexible to integrate new defense agents.

The paper proposes a multi-agent framework called "AutoDefense" to defend against jailbreak attacks on large language models. The key ideas include using response filtering to evaluate LLM outputs, assigning different roles to agents to analyze responses (e.g. intention analysis, prompt inference), integrating other defense methods like Llama Guard, and experimentally showing reductions in attack success rates while maintaining low false positive rates. The multi-agent approach aims to encourage divergent thinking and improve reasoning compared to single agent defenses. Overall, the core focus is on developing a flexible, model-agnostic defense against malicious jailbreaking of safety-trained LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the AutoDefense method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a multi-agent framework for LLM defense. Could you explain more about the motivation and advantage of using a multi-agent approach compared to other defense methods? 

2. The defense agency is a core component of AutoDefense. Could you elaborate on the design considerations and trade-offs when determining the number of agents and role assignment strategies?

3. When testing AutoDefense, why was the combination of refusal suppression and prefix injection chosen as the primary attack method? How does the framework address other types of jailbreak attacks?

4. The paper shows that incorporating additional defense components like LlamaGuard can further improve the performance of AutoDefense. What modifications were made to the framework to allow easy integration of new defense agents?  

5. The prompts designed for each LLM agent seem crucial for the agents to effectively complete their specialized tasks. What are some key strategies you used when crafting these prompts?

6. How does the autoDefense framework balance the trade-off between attack success rate reduction and false positive rate for safe content? What thresholds were set for these metrics?

7. When testing on different LLMs, what factors contribute most to the defense performance of AutoDefense? Does it correlate more with model size, alignment level, or something else?

8. The paper focuses on integrating up to 3 LLM agents. Have you experimented with even more agents? At what level of complexity does the benefit plateau or diminish?  

9. The paper mentions that dynamic communication patterns can further enhance the capability. Can you explain more about potential designs for dynamic coordination of agents?

10. How do you foresee AutoDefense being deployed? Would it be as an API that can defend victim LLMs running on separate servers? Or integrated tightly into model serving infrastructure?
