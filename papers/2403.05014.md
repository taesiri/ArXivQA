# [Simple Multigraph Convolution Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing multigraph convolution methods either ignore the cross-view interaction among multiple graphs, resulting in low effectiveness, or induce extremely high computational cost due to standard cross-view polynomial operators, resulting in low efficiency. There is a conflict between effectiveness and efficiency in previous multigraph convolution methods.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Simple MultiGraph Convolution Networks (SMGCN) to alleviate this problem. SMGCN contains two main components:

1) Consistent topology extraction module: Extracts consistent cross-view topology from the multigraphs at two levels - edge-level topology using cross-view voting scheme and subgraph-level topology using nearest neighbors. 

2) Simple polynomial expansion module: Performs polynomial expansion between the raw multigraphs and the extracted consistent topologies to induce the filtered graph signal. This is much more efficient than standard cross-view polynomial expansion.

Main Contributions:

1) SMGCN performs efficient and credible cross-view spatial message passing by using the extracted topologies in polynomial expansion, instead of direct standard cross-view polynomial expansion. This follows spectral convolution paradigm while reducing complexity.

2) Experiments on ACM and DBLP benchmarks demonstrate SMGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost compared to previous methods.

In summary, the key idea is to extract summarizations of the multigraph in the form of consistent topologies, and then perform efficient cross-view interaction on them instead of direct interaction on original complex multigraphs. This balances effectiveness and efficiency.
