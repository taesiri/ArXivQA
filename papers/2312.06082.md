# [XAI meets Biology: A Comprehensive Review of Explainable AI in   Bioinformatics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06082)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of explainable AI (XAI) techniques and their applications in bioinformatics. It begins by introducing popular deep learning models like convolutional and recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms that have shown great promise in bioinformatics but suffer from lack of interpretability. It then systematically examines recent XAI methods, categorizing them into model-agnostic techniques like LIME, SHAP, and LRP that can be applied to any model, and model-specific techniques like CAM and attention scores tailored to CNNs and transformer models. The paper thoroughly covers XAI applications across major bioinformatics domains - biological sequence, structure, gene expression, and imaging analysis. For each domain, it details how both model-agnostic and model-specific XAI methods have been critical to validate predictions, identify important features, and uncover potential model biases. However, it also discusses limitations of current techniques in capturing complexities of biological data. Finally, the paper provides thoughtful directions for future research towards developing XAI methods uniquely suited for bioinformatics that can provide reliable and accurate explanations matching the intricacies of biological systems.
