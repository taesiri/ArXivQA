# [GPT4SGG: Synthesizing Scene Graphs from Holistic and Region-specific   Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04314)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes GPT4SGG, a novel framework to leverage large language models (particularly GPT-4) for synthesizing high-quality scene graphs from holistic and region-specific image descriptions. It addresses three key challenges in learning scene graphs from natural language data - inability to extract complete relationships, ambiguity in visual-language alignment, and sparsity/bias issues. The framework transforms image data into a textual representation consisting of object categories and locations, a holistic caption, and captions for multiple image regions. This allows GPT-4 to synthesize more accurate and dense scene graphs by associating objects to synonyms, disambiguating references, and inferring latent relationships. An instruction-following dataset, COCO-SG@GPT, is introduced to evaluate LLM's scene graph generation abilities. Experiments demonstrate that GPT4SGG enables state-of-the-art SGG models to improve performance significantly by providing synthetically generated high-quality scene graphs as supervision. The framework presents a pioneering exploration of leveraging LLMs for structured interpretation of visual data. Overall, GPT4SGG achieves new SOTA for scene graph generation from natural language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called GPT4SGG that uses the text generation capabilities of large language models like GPT-4 to synthesize more accurate and complete scene graphs from holistic and region-specific image descriptions for improved supervision of scene graph generation models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called GPT4SGG that leverages large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, to synthesize scene graphs from holistic and region-specific image narratives. The key ideas include:

1) Transforming image data into a textual representation consisting of object categories, locations, a holistic caption, and region-specific captions to allow a language-only LLM to perform visual reasoning for scene graph generation. 

2) Using GPT-4 with a specialized prompt to generate more accurate and comprehensive scene graphs from the textual representation of images, which can serve as pseudo labels to supervise scene graph generation models.

3) Experimental results demonstrating that training scene graph generation models with the pseudo labels from GPT4SGG leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the GPT4SGG framework that effectively utilizes the reasoning capability of LLMs to synthesize high-quality scene graphs from textual narratives for improving scene graph generation.

The paper proposes a framework called "GPT4SGG" that utilizes large language models like GPT-4 to synthesize scene graphs from holistic and region-specific image narratives/captions. This allows generating more accurate and comprehensive scene graphs to provide weak supervision for training SGG models, overcoming issues like ambiguity, sparsity and bias when learning from just image-caption pairs. Key capabilities involved include the visual reasoning of LLMs to establish relationships between objects based on transformed textual representation of images.
