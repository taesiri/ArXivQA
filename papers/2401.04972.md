# [Whose wife is it anyway? Assessing bias against same-gender   relationships in machine translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation systems can exhibit bias against minorities, but most prior work has focused on gender bias related to individual words.
- This paper investigates potential bias against same-gender romantic relationships in machine translation, which can negatively impact LGBTQ people. 

Methodology:
- The authors generate a dataset of sentences in Spanish, French and Italian describing romantic relationships using occupations and relationship targets (e.g. spouse). 
- They test leading machine translation systems (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) on translating these sentences into English and measure accuracy of preserving subject gender.

Key Findings:  
- All systems show lower accuracy for same-gender relationships compared to different-gender ones. For same-gender, Amazon has highest accuracy (~50%) while others are <20%.
- Bias correlates with higher income occupations exhibiting more bias.  
- Language modeling analysis suggests target language (English) is more of an issue than source.
- Fine-tuning translation models on same-gender data removes the accuracy gap between relationship types.

Contributions:
- Identifies a new form of bias in MT - against same-gender relationships rather than individual gendered words.
- Provides methodology for assessing this bias using generated test sentences with occupations and relationships.
- Analyzes potential correlates of bias and localization of issues.
- Demonstrates data augmentation can mitigate the translation bias.
- Highlights need to consider broader ethics in NLP including implicit biases that emerge in subtle linguistic choices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates potential bias against same-gender relationships in machine translation systems, finding consistent biases favoring different-gender relationships in translations from Spanish, French, and Italian into English, with evidence that higher-income occupations exhibit greater biases, and proposes methods to mitigate such biases through fine-tuning and modifying input prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper identifies a consistent bias against same-gender romantic relationships in machine translation systems when translating from languages with grammatical gender (French, Italian, Spanish) into English. Specifically, the paper shows that when translating sentences portraying same-gender relationships, machine translation systems often inaccurately translate the gender of possessive pronouns, revealing a bias toward different-gender relationships. 

To demonstrate this, the authors:

- Generate a dataset of sentence templates portraying romantic relationships, with occupations marked for grammatical gender acting as sentence subjects, and gendered relationship terms (e.g. husband/wife) as objects. 

- Test several machine translation systems on translating these sentences into English and show lower accuracy for preserving the subject gender when the relationship is a same-gender one.

- Analyze possible correlates of bias and find higher income occupations exhibit more bias.

- Demonstrate the bias also occurs in language models to a lesser extent.

- Show the bias can be mitigated by fine-tuning translation models or modifying input prompts.

In summary, the key contribution is the rigorous demonstration and analysis of bias against same-gender relationships in machine translation across languages and systems. The paper also provides suggestions for reducing this bias.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this research include:

- Machine translation
- Bias against same-gender relationships
- Grammatical gender bias
- Faithfulness vs fluency in translation 
- Relationship representation in language models
- Measuring translation accuracy
- Data generation for relationship sentences
- Assessing social correlates of bias
- Mitigating same-gender bias through fine-tuning and prompt modification
- Ethical considerations around implicit bias against minority groups

The paper investigates potential bias against same-gender romantic relationships in machine translation systems. It focuses on languages with grammatical gender like French, Italian, and Spanish. The key ideas are around measuring this bias, analyzing what factors correlate with higher bias, and testing methods to reduce the bias through additional training data or modifying the input sentences. The authors also discuss relevance to ethics and equal treatment of minority groups.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper generates same-gender and different-gender relationship sentences using occupation nouns and relationship templates/targets. What are some limitations of using a synthetic dataset rather than naturally occurring sentences? Could the use of synthetic sentences impact the analysis?

2. The analysis focuses on translating from Spanish, French, and Italian into English. What kinds of biases might emerge when translating in the opposite direction, from English into those languages? Could the directionality of translation impact bias?

3. The paper finds higher rates of bias for higher-income occupations when translating same-gender relationships. What theories could explain this correlation? How might income interact with gender norms around relationships?

4. For analyzing language modeling, the paper uses perplexity from mBERT as a proxy for bias. What other metrics could also indicate bias at the language modeling level? What are limitations of using perplexity?

5. The fine-tuning translation experiment yields 100% accuracy on subject gender matching. Could this result indicate overfitting to the small dataset? How could overfitting be prevented? 

6. When modifying the translation prompt to add explicit gender information, substantial bias persists. What other methods could reinforce subject gender more effectively? What linguistic devices encode gender most clearly?

7. The analysis focuses on three major Romance languages. How might the findings generalize or differ for other language families and grammatical systems? What factors facilitate or prevent analogous analysis?

8. What legal and ethical considerations arise from having bias in machine translation systems? Who is most impacted and how? What steps could mitigate harm?

9. The paper acknowledges limitations around social vs. grammatical gender. How could the analysis distinguish translation bias stemming from each type of gender? What changes would be needed?

10. What direction could future work take to assess additional facets of bias in relationships translation? What other relationships and social variables should be analyzed? How could less visible minorities be incorporated?
