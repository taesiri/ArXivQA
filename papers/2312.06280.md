# [Adaptive Compression of the Latent Space in Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06280)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes ALD-VAE, a novel approach for automatically determining the optimal latent space size in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The key idea is to gradually compress the latent dimensionality during training by pruning neurons from the encoder and decoder networks. Four metrics - reconstruction loss, Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) for reconstructions and generations, and Silhouette score for clustering - are monitored. When all metrics start deteriorating, the compression stops and the current dimensionality is considered optimal. Experiments on four image datasets (SPRITES, MNIST, FashionMNIST, EuroSAT) demonstrate that ALD-VAE approximates an optimal latent size much faster than standard grid search over multiple VAE models, while reaching the same accuracy as directly training with the optimal dimensionality. The algorithm works robustly across different initial dimensionality sizes and random seeds. By eliminating the need for manual tuning of the dimensionality hyperparameter, ALD-VAE makes VAEs more practical for real-world usage. The simplicity of the approach also allows easy integration into existing VAE architectures.
