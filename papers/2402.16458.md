# [ID-XCB: Data-independent Debiasing for Fair and Accurate   Transformer-based Cyberbullying Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16458)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cyberbullying detection models often suffer from biases leading to false positives when swear words are present. This is due to swear words being used as a proxy for collecting cyberbullying data.
- Existing debiasing methods rely on bias constraints from the training data, causing overfitting and reduced generalizability to unseen data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ID-XCB, the first data-independent debiasing technique for cyberbullying detection. 
- It combines adversarial training, bias constraints from an independent validation set, and contextualized embeddings from transformers.
- Adversarial training uses masked swear words to shift model attention away from profanity. 
- Bias constraints are optimized in a non-convex setting using the non-zero-sum method.
- Transformer embeddings support generalizability by transferring knowledge.

Key Contributions:
- The authors quantify swear word impact on transformer biases, showing consistency across models and datasets.
- ID-XCB shows improved performance and bias reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods on two datasets.
- It also shows potential for bias mitigation and performance trade-offs on unseen data.  
- The paper includes in-depth analyses of model components, swear words, ablation experiments, and generalizability.

In summary, the key innovation is the data-independent debiasing approach ID-XCB, which mitigates biases while maintaining or improving performance on cyberbullying detection, with analyses demonstrating its potential to generalize across unseen datasets.
