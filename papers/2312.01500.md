# [Unsupervised Approach to Evaluate Sentence-Level Fluency: Do We Really   Need Reference?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fluency is an important aspect of evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems, but there is a lack of automatic metrics to measure fluency without reference texts. 
- Existing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE rely on references and are limited in capturing fluency.
- Manual evaluation of fluency is expensive, laborious, and subjective.

Proposed Solution:
- Adapt an existing unsupervised technique to measure sentence-level fluency using syntactic log-odds ratio (SLOR) score from language models.
- Train LSTM-based recurrent neural network language models with various embeddings (FastText, BPEmb, IndicBERT, MuRIL) on scraped Indic language news articles.
- Also experiment with multilingual BERT (mBERT) and MuRIL models using zero-shot inferences and fine-tuning.  
- Evaluate models by correlating predicted fluency scores against human judgments on a newly created test set of 5000 manually annotated Indic language sentences.

Main Contributions:
- Release benchmark test set of 500 fluency-annotated sentences each for 10 Indic languages.
- Present extensive experiments to measure fluency of 6 Indo-Aryan and 4 Dravidian languages using SLOR technique. 
- Identify best models - RNN LMs trained on MuRIL embeddings and fine-tuned MuRIL model perform the best and correlate better with human assessments of fluency.
- Establish the feasibility of reference-free, unsupervised evaluation of NLG fluency for morphologically rich Indic languages.

The paper demonstrates an effective approach to evaluate NLG fluency without needing reference texts, through correlations against human judgments. The techniques can enable faster, cheaper and more consistent fluency evaluation.
