# [Unsupervised Approach to Evaluate Sentence-Level Fluency: Do We Really   Need Reference?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fluency is an important aspect of evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems, but there is a lack of automatic metrics to measure fluency without reference texts. 
- Existing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE rely on references and are limited in capturing fluency.
- Manual evaluation of fluency is expensive, laborious, and subjective.

Proposed Solution:
- Adapt an existing unsupervised technique to measure sentence-level fluency using syntactic log-odds ratio (SLOR) score from language models.
- Train LSTM-based recurrent neural network language models with various embeddings (FastText, BPEmb, IndicBERT, MuRIL) on scraped Indic language news articles.
- Also experiment with multilingual BERT (mBERT) and MuRIL models using zero-shot inferences and fine-tuning.  
- Evaluate models by correlating predicted fluency scores against human judgments on a newly created test set of 5000 manually annotated Indic language sentences.

Main Contributions:
- Release benchmark test set of 500 fluency-annotated sentences each for 10 Indic languages.
- Present extensive experiments to measure fluency of 6 Indo-Aryan and 4 Dravidian languages using SLOR technique. 
- Identify best models - RNN LMs trained on MuRIL embeddings and fine-tuned MuRIL model perform the best and correlate better with human assessments of fluency.
- Establish the feasibility of reference-free, unsupervised evaluation of NLG fluency for morphologically rich Indic languages.

The paper demonstrates an effective approach to evaluate NLG fluency without needing reference texts, through correlations against human judgments. The techniques can enable faster, cheaper and more consistent fluency evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents experiments on unsupervised, reference-free approaches to evaluate the fluency of text generated by natural language systems for 10 Indic languages, by training language models using various embeddings and correlating their fluency scores with human judgments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are two-fold:

1) The authors release 5K human annotated sentences (500 sentences for each of the 10 languages) which can be used as a benchmark test-set for fluency evaluation. 

2) The authors present their reference-free, unsupervised experiments to measure fluency for 6 Indo-Aryan and 4 Dravidian languages. They explore several models by a) training RNN-based language models (LMs) leveraging various embeddings, b) using mBERT and MuRIL for zero-shot inferences and by c) fine-tuning mBERT and MuRIL. They identify the best models through extensive experiments on the 10 Indic languages.

So in summary, the key contributions are creating a new human-annotated fluency benchmark dataset for 10 Indic languages, and conducting comprehensive experiments to measure fluency in an unsupervised, reference-free manner for these languages.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using syntactic log-odds ratio (SLOR) to compute fluency scores. Can you explain in more detail how SLOR works and how it is able to capture fluency without reference texts? 

2. The authors experiment with several recurrent neural network architectures like LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM. Can you explain the key differences between these architectures and why the choice of architecture matters for the task of fluency evaluation?

3. The paper evaluates several embedding techniques like FastText, BPEmb, IndicBERT and MuRIL. What are the key strengths and weaknesses of each these embedding methods when applied to morphologically rich languages like those explored in the paper?

4. The paper finds that the Muril + LSTM model performs the best despite being trained on less data than other models. What aspects of Muril embeddings and the LSTM architecture make this combination effective even with less training data? 

5. How exactly does the paper compute the unigram probabilities required to calculate the SLOR score? What challenges might there be in accurately estimating unigram probabilities?

6. The paper uses Pearson correlation to evaluate how well the model fluency scores correlate with human judgments. What are some limitations of using Pearson correlation for this purpose? Are there better evaluation approaches you would suggest?

7. For data collection, the paper uses web scraping and then extensive filtering and cleaning of the scraped content. What are some ways this pipeline could be improved to get higher quality training data?  

8. The authors identify handling sentences with digits and abbreviations as a key challenge. How can this issue be addressed? What changes would you suggest to the approach?

9. The paper studies 10 Indic languages from the Dravidian and Indo-Aryan families. Do you think the method would generalize well to other language families like Sino-Tibetan? Why or why not?

10. The paper focuses on sentence-level fluency evaluation. How difficult would it be to extend this approach to assess discourse-level fluency and coherence across multiple sentences? What changes would be required?
