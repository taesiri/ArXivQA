# [AV-Occupant Perceived Risk Model for Cut-In Scenarios with Empirical   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating perceived risk is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to ensure comfort, trust and acceptance by users. 
- Existing models for quantifying perceived risk have limitations in handling diverse traffic conditions, infrastructure, and the uncertainties of dynamic obstacles like vehicles cutting-in.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a novel AV-Occupant Risk (AVOR) model to estimate perceived risk during cut-in maneuvers by enhancing the Driver's Risk Field (DRF) model. 
- A virtual cut-in collision (VCC) point is introduced based on the intersection of the ego vehicle's longitudinal velocity and cut-in vehicle's lateral velocity. 
- The VCC point assigns dynamic costs based on time-to-arrival, reflecting higher risk for faster cut-ins. This is incorporated into the DRF's environmental cost map.

Experiments and Results:
- Real-life cut-in scenarios from Waymo Dataset were used in a user study with 18 participants rating perceived risk.
- The AVOR model demonstrated significant improvements in capturing the uptrend in perceived risk at the start of cut-ins, which the DRF model failed to detect. 
- AVOR model enhanced accuracy by up to 54% compared to DRF model, showing responsiveness to factors like high-risk scenarios and increased scene population.

Main Contributions:
- Novel AVOR model to estimate perceived risk for cut-in maneuvers by integrating uncertainties of dynamic obstacles.
- Empirical validation using real-life scenarios and subjective risk ratings from 18 users.
- Demonstrated improved performance over DRF model, especially capturing critical perceived risk uptrend at cut-in initiation.
- Established importance of detecting precise perceived risk trends to ensure AV comfort, trust and adoption.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in developing and validating an enhanced perceived risk model for autonomous vehicles to improve comfort and trust during diverse cut-in scenarios.
