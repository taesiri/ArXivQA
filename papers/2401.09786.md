# [Adaptive Self-training Framework for Fine-grained Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Scene graph generation (SGG) models suffer from inherent issues in benchmark datasets such as long-tailed predicate distribution and missing annotations. 
- Long-tailed predicate distribution refers to the imbalance where general predicates (e.g. "on") frequently appear while fine-grained predicates (e.g. "walking in") rarely occur. This causes models to be biased towards predicting general predicates.
- Missing annotations incorrectly treat unannotated relationships as "background" (bg), providing wrong supervision to models. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a self-training framework called ST-SGG that assigns pseudo-labels to confident predictions on unannotated triplets and retrains the model on them.
- A novel pseudo-labeling technique called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM) is proposed to set adaptive confidence thresholds for assigning pseudo-labels.
- CATM handles issues like semantic ambiguity of predicates, bias from long-tailed distribution, etc. faced in SGG.
- For MPNN-based SGG models, a Graph Structure Learner (GSL) is used to enrich the scene graph connectivity, helping identify relations for pseudo-labeling.

Main Contributions:
- First work to adopt self-training for SGG, which is challenging due to difficulty in setting thresholds for pseudo-labeling.
- Proposes CATM to address unique SGG challenges for accurate pseudo-labeling.
- Devises GSL to improve connectivity of scene graphs for MPNN-based SGG models under self-training.
- Achieves state-of-the-art for fine-grained predicates while retaining performance on general predicates.
- Model-agnostic framework that can be applied to improve various SGG models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-training framework for scene graph generation that assigns pseudo-labels to unannotated triplets and iteratively retrains the model to effectively utilize them for alleviating the long-tailed predicate distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a self-training framework for scene graph generation (SGG) called ST-SGG. The key contributions are:

1) Introducing a self-training framework for SGG that assigns pseudo-labels to unannotated triplets and iteratively retrains the SGG model using both annotated and pseudo-labeled triplets. This allows exploiting the large volume of unannotated triplets in benchmark SGG datasets.

2) Proposing a novel pseudo-labeling technique called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM) that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds considering the semantic ambiguity of predicates, long-tailed distribution, and model's learning state. 

3) Developing a graph structure learner (GSL) that enriches the scene graph structure by discovering relevant relations, which is beneficial when adopting the proposed self-training framework to MPNN-based SGG models.

4) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various SGG models, showing consistent improvements particularly on fine-grained predicates. The framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to many existing SGG models.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the first work that adopts self-training for SGG and proposes techniques tailored for SGG to effectively exploit unannotated triplets in benchmark datasets.

It assigns pseudo-labels to unannotated triplets in an iterative manner to exploit unlabeled data.

Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness on benchmark datasets like Visual Genome and Open Images.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a self-training framework called ST-SGG for scene graph generation. What are the key challenges in designing a self-training framework for SGG compared to image recognition tasks?

2. The paper introduces a novel pseudo-labeling technique called CATM. What are the key components of CATM and how do they address the challenges of pseudo-labeling in SGG?

3. The paper argues that simply adapting existing self-training methods from image recognition to SGG fails. What are the reasons for this failure? 

4. Explain the motivation behind using class-specific adaptive thresholds in CATM. How does it help address semantic ambiguity and long-tail issues in SGG? 

5. The paper proposes using class-specific momentum in threshold updating. What is the intuition behind this and how does it prevent bias towards majority classes?

6. For MPNN-based SGG models, the paper devises a Graph Structure Learner (GSL). What is the motivation behind using GSL and how does it facilitate confident pseudo-labeling?

7. The paper demonstrates model-agnostic applicability of ST-SGG. What modifications need to be made to apply ST-SGG to any SGG model?

8. How does the pseudo-labeling strategy used in ST-SGG differ from that in IE-Trans? What are the limitations of IE-Trans that ST-SGG aims to address?

9. The paper shows that ST-SGG improves performance on fine-grained predicates. Analyze the trade-offs involved and discuss if focusing solely on tail classes is an appropriate evaluation strategy.

10. The paper focuses only on utilizing unlabeled triplets from existing SGG datasets. Discuss potential ways in which additional external resources can be leveraged to further enrich training data.
