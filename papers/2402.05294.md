# [Examining Modality Incongruity in Multimodal Federated Learning for   Medical Vision and Language-based Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement and Motivation
- Multimodal federated learning (MMFL) utilizes data from multiple modalities (e.g. images and text) across distributed clients to train more powerful models. 
- However, the impact of missing modalities, also called modality incongruity, in some clients is overlooked. It is unclear if incongruent MMFL with a mix of unimodal and multimodal clients performs better than unimodal federated learning (FL).

- This work examines the effects of modality incongruity in MMFL for a multi-label disease classification task using chest x-rays (images) and radiology reports (text). Some clients have both modalities while others only have images.  

- Key questions: Does incongruent MMFL benefit over unimodal FL by leveraging the extra modality? How does modality incongruity vary with data heterogeneity across clients? Answering these can help design better MMFL systems.

Methods and Contributions
- Empirically find that incongruent MMFL outperforms unimodal FL only under data homogeneity. With heterogeneity, unimodal FL is better. Incongruency effects increase with more heterogeneity.

- Investigate different self-attention schemes for information fusion in multimodal clients. Varying schemes provide small improvements but fail to outperform unimodal FL.  

- Propose a modality imputation network (MIN) to generate missing text modality from images in unimodal clients. Converts system to pseudo-congruent MMFL and outperforms unimodal FL.

- Introduce client-level solutions via regularization techniques and server-level solutions by distilling knowledge from unlabeled multimodal data to achieve modality-invariant representations despite incongruency.

- Server-level method called LOOT uses a novel strategy to finetune each client model to match embeddings of other clients. Outperforms other techniques for moderate heterogeneity.

Conclusion
- Modality imputation is the most effective and practical solution, closely followed by server-level finetuning, in mitigating effects of missing modalities in MMFL.

The paper provides useful insights into designing MMFL systems with mixed unimodal and multimodal clients, validated on two public medical datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examines the impact of missing modalities (modality incongruity) in heterogeneous multimodal federated learning settings and investigates various methods including self-attention schemes, modality imputation, and regularization techniques to mitigate the effects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This is the first work that investigates modality incongruity effects in various heterogeneous multimodal federated learning (MMFL) settings. It empirically determines the conditions under which an incongruent MMFL system performs worse than the corresponding unimodal FL system in the context of non-IID data distribution. 

2. It demonstrates how varying self-attention masks in the multimodal client(s) impacts the effectiveness of information fusion in incongruent MMFL systems.

3. It transforms the incongruent MMFL problem to a pseudo-congruent MMFL system by introducing a modality translation technique in unimodal clients using a modality imputation network (MIN). This is shown to mitigate modality incongruity effects.

4. It introduces regularization schemes at both client and server levels to achieve client-invariant representations despite modality incongruity. This includes proximal loss, contrastive loss, and modality-aware consistency regularization loss.  

5. It demonstrates the potential of leveraging unlabeled data (both unimodal and multimodal) on the server to mitigate modality incongruity issues via ensemble distillation and client model fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of modality incongruity in multimodal federated learning, along with proposals for different techniques to address this issue under varied settings.

The paper examines the impact of missing modalities, also called modality incongruity, in multimodal federated learning settings involving chest X-ray images and radiology reports for multilabel disease classification. It analyzes different methods like varying self-attention, modality imputation, proximal and contrastive regularization, knowledge distillation etc. to mitigate the effects of modality incongruity using two public datasets - MIMIC-CXR and Open-I. The key focus is on determining if an incongruent multimodal federated learning system with both unimodal and multimodal clients performs better than a unified federated learning system with only unimodal clients.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces a Modality Imputation Network (MIN) to generate missing modalities (radiology reports) in unimodal clients, converting the incongruent MMFL system into a pseudo-congruent one. What are the key strengths and weaknesses of this approach? How can the quality and diversity of generated reports be further improved?

2) The paper analyzes the impact of 4 different self-attention schemes for multimodal fusion, including isolated, causal, partially bidirectional and bidirectional. Which one works the best and why? What other attention mechanisms can be explored? 

3) The paper proposes client-level (FedMultiProx, MultiMOON) and server-level (LOOT) solutions by adapting existing methods like FedProx, MOON etc. What modifications make these methods suitable for addressing modality incongruity? Can these be combined into an ensemble solution?

4) How does the performance tradeoff between unimodal FL, incongruent MMFL and pseudo-congruent MMFL systems change with increasing heterogeneity in data distribution across clients? What is the tipping point?

5) The paper concludes that incongruent MMFL performs worse than unimodal FL under non-IID setting. Does this hold for other multimodal tasks involving different modalities and network architectures? What experiments can be done to validate the generalization?

6) For the proposed MIN, how does performance change if there is a domain shift between the client where it is trained and clients where it is applied? Would adapting domain adaptation techniques help?

7) What hybrid methods combining self-attention schemes, MIN imputation and client/server regularization can be effective? How to design experiments to analyze contributions of each component of such hybrid solutions?

8) What alternate strategies like modality dropout during training in multimodal clients can help mitigate effects of missing modalities? How do they compare against methods analyzed in the paper?

9) How sensitive are the performance trends and relative merits of different methods to the quantity and domain of unlabeled data available on the server? What analyses can be done?

10) What other evaluation metrics beyond model accuracy can be used to assess the impact of modality incongruity and effectiveness of different mitigation techniques?
