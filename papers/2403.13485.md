# [An Entropy-based Text Watermarking Detection Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) perform well in detecting watermarks in high-entropy text scenarios, but have limitations in low-entropy scenarios like code generation. 
- In low-entropy scenarios, there are many deterministic tokens that are difficult to watermark. So there are fewer watermarked tokens, leading to lower detection accuracy.
- Existing methods like KGW and SWEET have limitations in handling low-entropy scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Entropy-based Watermark Detection (EWD) method that assigns higher weights to high-entropy tokens during watermark detection. 
- The core idea is that the impact of a token on detection should be proportional to its entropy - high entropy tokens are easier to watermark so should have higher influence.
- EWD computes a continuous entropy-based weight for each token. The final watermark score is a weighted sum of watermarked tokens based on these weights.
- This ensures low-entropy unmodified tokens have minimal negative impact on detection accuracy.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes EWD method that computes entropy-based weights for tokens to improve watermark detection in low-entropy text.
- Provides theoretical analysis of EWD's detection accuracy and compares to baselines. Shows lower type I and type II errors.
- Evaluates EWD on code generation datasets showing 10.6% and 5.6% better accuracy over baseline SWEET method.
- Demonstrates EWD achieves similar performance as KGW on high entropy datasets, showing versatility of the approach.
- Overall, EWD enhances watermark detection accuracy in low-entropy scenarios while maintaining performance in high entropy text.
