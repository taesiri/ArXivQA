# [Team Flow at DRC2023: Building Common Ground and Text-based Turn-taking   in a Travel Agent Spoken Dialogue System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13816)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current dialogue systems still lack capabilities for smooth and natural interactions with users. Specifically, they have difficulties with building common ground, taking turns naturally based on user comprehension, and generating appropriate responses. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper presents a dialogue system developed by Team Flow for the Dialogue Robot Competition 2023 (DRC2023) travel planning task. The system focuses on:
  - Building common ground: It tracks user preferences and accepted information as common ground to better understand the user and generate relevant responses.  
  - Natural turn-taking: It determines appropriate voice actions (responses, backchannels, nodding) based on incremental ASR text to engage users while waiting for their comprehension.
  - Generating queries and responses using common ground: It leverages common ground to formulate queries for searching sightseeing spots. It also generates system responses based on dialogue history and selected dialogue acts.

Key Contributions:
- Novel architecture for tracking common ground from dialogue to improve context modeling
- Approach for more natural turn-taking by detecting voice actions based on live ASR transcripts  
- Demonstration of system that constructs common ground, takes turns appropriately, and produces context-relevant responses in a travel planning domain
- Analysis of system performance in live interactions on metrics of user satisfaction and travel plan feasibility

The paper provides valuable insights into techniques for smoother and more natural human-machine interaction through context modeling, turn-taking, and response generation. The presented system and results represent progress toward more capable dialogue agents.
