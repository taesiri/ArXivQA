# [GCFAgg: Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation for Multi-view   Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06799)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to learn an effective consensus representation from multi-view data for clustering. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called GCFAggMVC to address two key issues:

1) Existing methods rely on view-wise aggregation to obtain a consensus representation, which can be negatively impacted by noise or missing views in some samples. 

2) Contrastive learning methods align view representations at the sample level, but this may make representations from different samples in the same cluster dissimilar, which harms clustering performance.

To address issue 1, the paper proposes a Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation (GCFAgg) module. This module learns a global similarity relationship between all samples and enhances the consensus representation using samples with high similarity. This allows using complementary information across samples to reduce the impact of noise/missing views.

To address issue 2, the paper proposes a Structure-guided Contrastive Learning (SgCL) module. This contrasts the consensus representation with view-specific representations while considering their global similarity. It draws positive pairs closer while pushing apart negative pairs with low similarity, avoiding making representations from the same cluster dissimilar.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that learning a consensus representation using GCFAgg and aligning representations with SgCL will improve multi-view clustering performance compared to existing view-wise aggregation and contrastive learning techniques. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel multi-view clustering network called GCFAggMVC. The key components are:

- A Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation (GCFAgg) module that learns a global similarity relationship between samples and uses it to obtain a consensus representation across views. This aims to fully exploit complementary information from similar samples. 

- A Structure-guided Contrastive Learning (SgCL) module that aligns the consensus representation with view-specific representations using contrastive learning. It incorporates the global structure relationship to make representations from the same cluster more similar.  

2. Demonstrating that GCFAggMVC achieves state-of-the-art performance on both complete and incomplete multi-view clustering benchmarks.

3. Showing that the proposed GCFAgg and SgCL modules can be flexibly incorporated into existing multi-view clustering frameworks like DSIMVC to boost performance, especially on incomplete multi-view data.

4. Providing ablation studies and visualizations to analyze the effectiveness of the key components of the proposed method.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel end-to-end deep clustering network GCFAggMVC that leverages global structure relationships and contrastive learning to learn effective consensus representations for robust multi-view clustering. The flexible modules can be incorporated into existing methods.
