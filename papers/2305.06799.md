# [GCFAgg: Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation for Multi-view   Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06799)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to learn an effective consensus representation from multi-view data for clustering. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called GCFAggMVC to address two key issues:

1) Existing methods rely on view-wise aggregation to obtain a consensus representation, which can be negatively impacted by noise or missing views in some samples. 

2) Contrastive learning methods align view representations at the sample level, but this may make representations from different samples in the same cluster dissimilar, which harms clustering performance.

To address issue 1, the paper proposes a Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation (GCFAgg) module. This module learns a global similarity relationship between all samples and enhances the consensus representation using samples with high similarity. This allows using complementary information across samples to reduce the impact of noise/missing views.

To address issue 2, the paper proposes a Structure-guided Contrastive Learning (SgCL) module. This contrasts the consensus representation with view-specific representations while considering their global similarity. It draws positive pairs closer while pushing apart negative pairs with low similarity, avoiding making representations from the same cluster dissimilar.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that learning a consensus representation using GCFAgg and aligning representations with SgCL will improve multi-view clustering performance compared to existing view-wise aggregation and contrastive learning techniques. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel multi-view clustering network called GCFAggMVC. The key components are:

- A Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation (GCFAgg) module that learns a global similarity relationship between samples and uses it to obtain a consensus representation across views. This aims to fully exploit complementary information from similar samples. 

- A Structure-guided Contrastive Learning (SgCL) module that aligns the consensus representation with view-specific representations using contrastive learning. It incorporates the global structure relationship to make representations from the same cluster more similar.  

2. Demonstrating that GCFAggMVC achieves state-of-the-art performance on both complete and incomplete multi-view clustering benchmarks.

3. Showing that the proposed GCFAgg and SgCL modules can be flexibly incorporated into existing multi-view clustering frameworks like DSIMVC to boost performance, especially on incomplete multi-view data.

4. Providing ablation studies and visualizations to analyze the effectiveness of the key components of the proposed method.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel end-to-end deep clustering network GCFAggMVC that leverages global structure relationships and contrastive learning to learn effective consensus representations for robust multi-view clustering. The flexible modules can be incorporated into existing methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering network called GCFAggMVC that learns a global similarity relationship between samples to enhance a consensus representation and aligns it with view-specific representations using a structure-guided contrastive loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complete and incomplete multi-view clustering tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in multi-view clustering:

- This paper proposes a new deep learning framework called GCFAggMVC for multi-view clustering. Most prior deep learning methods for multi-view clustering use view-wise aggregation to obtain a consensus representation. This paper argues that view-wise aggregation can be problematic when some views are noisy or missing. 

- Instead, GCFAggMVC learns global relationships between all samples using a transformer module, and enhances the consensus representation using samples with high similarity. This allows it to handle noise and missing views better.

- The paper also proposes a new contrastive loss called SgCL that considers global structure when constructing positive/negative pairs. This makes representations from the same cluster more similar compared to standard contrastive losses.

- Experiments are done on 13 datasets ranging from small to large scale. GCFAggMVC outperforms recent methods like SiMVC, CoMVC, MFLVC across most datasets.

- Ablation studies validate the benefits of the proposed GCFAgg module and SgCL loss. Visualizations also show GCFAggMVC learns better separated clusters.

- The GCFAgg module is shown to be flexible - it can be incorporated into methods like DSIMVC to improve incomplete multi-view clustering, again outperforming recent approaches.

In summary, this paper makes innovations in how the consensus representation is formed and contrastive learning is done, leading to state-of-the-art performance on both complete and incomplete multi-view clustering tasks. The GCFAgg module in particular seems like a useful technique for handling noise and missing views.
