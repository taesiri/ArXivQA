# [Early ChatGPT User Portrait through the Lens of Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper aims to develop an early portrait of ChatGPT users by analyzing two datasets of real-world ChatGPT conversations shared by users through an open-source browser extension. Specifically, it seeks to understand the topics of interest, potential careers, and how user interests evolve over time. 

Data Description 
The paper analyzes two datasets - shareGPT52K and shareGPT92K, which contain 52,000 and 92,000 multi-turn conversations between users and ChatGPT. After filtering, the shareGPT92K dataset contained 87,957 valid conversations used for analysis.

Methods
The paper takes a multi-pronged approach to analyze the datasets:

1) Examines conversation statistics like length distribution, language distribution to characterize dynamics 

2) Conducts sentiment analysis to gauge emotional tones and sentiment shifts in conversations

3) Applies topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discern key topics of interest

Key Findings
- 70% of conversations are in English, 6% Chinese, 3.5% Korean  
- Over 65.5% of conversations finish within 10 turns
- Users predominantly express positive/neutral sentiment  
- ChatGPT answers are mostly positive in tone
- Top topics include coding, business, news, interpersonal skills
- Notable shift over time from Russia-Ukraine to Messi soccer news

Main Contributions  
- Provides first portrait of early ChatGPT users' interests and evolution 
- Framework to analyze conversation datasets using statistics, sentiment, topics
- Reveals AI capabilities in sentiment handling and topic breadth
- Groundwork to motivate more extensive user behavior research

Limitations 
- Dataset from optional browser extension so may not represent all users
- Commercial constraints prevent accessing more exhaustive dataset

Future Work
- Analyze more diverse inputs and modalities as ChatGPT capabilities expand 
- Develop better algorithms for input type recognition
