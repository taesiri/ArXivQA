# Principle-Driven Self-Alignment of Language Models from Scratch with   Minimal Human Supervision

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper appears to be: How can large language models be aligned to human values and intentions effectively and efficiently, with minimal dependence on extensive human annotations?The key points are:- Recent AI assistants like ChatGPT rely heavily on human supervision via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from feedback. This dependence has limitations in terms of cost, quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and potential biases of human annotations. - The paper proposes a new approach called "Principle-Driven Self-Alignment" that combines human-defined principles and the generative power of LLMs to align LLMs with minimal human supervision.- The approach has 4 main stages: Topic-Guided Self-Instruct, Principle-Driven Self-Alignment, Principle Engraving, and Verbose Cloning. Together these aim to develop helpful, ethical and reliable AI assistants.- When applied to LLaMA-65B, the approach results in an AI assistant called Dromedary that surpasses state-of-the-art models on alignment benchmarks, using less than 300 lines of human annotations.So in summary, the central hypothesis is around developing a more efficient alignment approach for LLMs that depends minimally on human supervision, with the goal of creating helpful, ethical and reliable AI assistants. The Principle-Driven Self-Alignment method is proposed and evaluated as a way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a novel self-alignment approach called "Principle-Driven Self-Alignment" for training large language models with minimal human supervision. The key ideas include:1. Using a small set of human-defined principles or rules to guide the behavior and responses of the AI model instead of relying on extensive labeled data. 2. Employing the model's own generative capabilities in a bootstrapping fashion to create training data via "Self-Instruct", reducing the need for human annotations.3. Leveraging in-context learning with a few demonstration examples to teach the model how to apply principles for producing helpful, ethical and reliable responses.4. Further optimizing the model via "Principle Engraving", engraving the principles into the model's parameters through fine-tuning.5. Enhancing the model's ability to generate more comprehensive responses through "Verbose Cloning".Overall, the main contribution seems to be developing a more efficient alignment technique that requires orders of magnitude fewer human annotations (less than 300 lines), while producing an AI assistant called Dromedary that appears to surpass competitive baselines on various benchmarks. The method aims to improve the alignment of LLMs from scratch independent of existing well-established models.
