# [PREIM3D: 3D Consistent Precise Image Attribute Editing from a Single   Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10263)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform efficient and precise 3D-aware image attribute editing from a single real image. Specifically, the paper aims to achieve the following goals:

1. Efficient image inversion and editing: The paper aims to develop an efficient framework that allows inversion and editing of a real image in a single forward pass, as opposed to slow optimization-based methods. 

2. Precise inversion with 3D consistency: The inverted image should maintain consistency when rendered from different 3D viewpoints, not just the input view.

3. Precise editing of attributes: Editing one facial attribute (e.g. adding smile) should not affect other attributes (e.g. age, gender) that are not meant to be edited.

To summarize, the main hypothesis is that by training an efficient encoder for inversion, enforcing 3D consistency, and editing in a specialized manifold space, the proposed PREIM3D method can achieve efficient, 3D consistent and precise image editing from just a single input photo. The experiments aim to demonstrate PREIM3D's superiority over previous inversion and editing techniques on these criteria.
