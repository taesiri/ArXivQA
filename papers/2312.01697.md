# [Hulk: A Universal Knowledge Translator for Human-Centric Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01697)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric foundation model capable of handling major 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks simultaneously without task-specific fine-tuning. Hulk simplifies the heterogeneous inputs and outputs of these tasks into four modalities which are further tokenized into two basic formats - continuous digits and discrete words. It then reformulates the diverse tasks as modality translation and employs a shared encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific tokenizers/de-tokenizers and indicators. Trained on around 30 million human-centric data samples, Hulk pushes the state-of-the-art on eight tasks covering parsing, pose estimation, detection, attribution, captioning, action recognition and 3D modeling. For example, it improves pedestrian detection by 0.7% MRâˆ’2, human parsing by 2.36% mIoU and 3D pose estimation by 4.5 MPVPE, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general human perceiver without needing further tuning. Key innovations include the consolidation of task inputs/outputs into two elemental heads and the unification of specialized model designs into simple yet versatile components.
