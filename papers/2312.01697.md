# [Hulk: A Universal Knowledge Translator for Human-Centric Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01697)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric foundation model capable of handling major 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks simultaneously without task-specific fine-tuning. Hulk simplifies the heterogeneous inputs and outputs of these tasks into four modalities which are further tokenized into two basic formats - continuous digits and discrete words. It then reformulates the diverse tasks as modality translation and employs a shared encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific tokenizers/de-tokenizers and indicators. Trained on around 30 million human-centric data samples, Hulk pushes the state-of-the-art on eight tasks covering parsing, pose estimation, detection, attribution, captioning, action recognition and 3D modeling. For example, it improves pedestrian detection by 0.7% MR−2, human parsing by 2.36% mIoU and 3D pose estimation by 4.5 MPVPE, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general human perceiver without needing further tuning. Key innovations include the consolidation of task inputs/outputs into two elemental heads and the unification of specialized model designs into simple yet versatile components.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Hulk is the first multimodal human-centric perceiver capable of handling major 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision language tasks in a unified framework without task-specific finetuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance by condensing task heads into two general heads for predicting semantics and locations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. The authors propose Hulk, the first general human-centric perceiver capable of handling 2D vision tasks, 3D vision tasks, skeleton-based tasks, and vision-language tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.

2. To facilitate unified modeling, the authors propose to design only two types of basic blocks - one for predicting semantics and the other for predicting locations - to establish tokenizers and de-tokenizers for the output modalities. 

3. Hulk pushes the performance limits of 8 human-centric tasks, including 2D vision tasks, 3D vision tasks, skeleton-based tasks, and vision-language tasks. For example, it improves the state-of-the-art by +1.5% mIoU on human parsing, -0.7% MRˆ{-2} on pedestrian detection, -1.4 MPVPE on mesh recovery, etc.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Hulk as the first general human-centric perceiver model capable of handling diverse vision and language tasks related to human perception using a unified framework, and demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new general human-centric perceiver model called Hulk. What are the key innovations in Hulk that set it apart from prior human-centric foundation models like UniHCP?

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing human-centric perception models typically focus on a single task and require task-specific designs and fine-tuning, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Although some recent human-centric foundation models can handle multiple tasks, they still need task-specific tuning and struggle with diverse input/output formats across tasks like 3D vision, language, and skeleton-based tasks. The goal is to develop a general human-centric perceiver that can handle major 2D, 3D, skeleton, and language tasks in a unified way without task-specific adaptation.

Method: 
The paper proposes Hulk, a multimodal human-centric foundation model capable of tackling diverse tasks by treating them as modality translation. Hulk unifies specialized model components into - 1) Modality tokenizers/detokenizers with two types of heads - discrete semantics and continuous locations. They transform data into shared token space and back. 2) Shared encoder-decoder architecture that translates input tokens to output tokens, guided by output modality indicators. 3) Contrastive semantic loss and L1 location loss.

Hulk condenses inputs/outputs into 2 basic forms (language & locations) and 4 modalities - text, image, sparse labels (locations + semantics), dense labels (per-pixel semantics). It models tasks as translation between these modalities using the above components without specialized tuning.

Contributions:
- Proposes first general human perceiver handling major 2D, 3D, skeleton and language tasks simultaneously without task-specific tuning.
- Develops modality translation framework to unify diverse tasks through simple tokenizer/detokenizers and shared encoder-decoder.
- Pushes state-of-the-art on 8 tasks like parsing, pose estimation, action recognition by good margins.
- Sets strong baseline for developing unified human-centric foundation models.
