# PAL: Program-aided Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can large language models (LLMs) be improved at reasoning tasks involving arithmetic and symbolic reasoning by combining them with a programmatic reasoning approach?The key hypothesis is that by having the LLM generate programmatic code as intermediate reasoning steps, and then executing that code with an interpreter, the overall system can achieve better accuracy compared to having the LLM attempt to do all the reasoning itself.In particular, the paper hypothesizes that:- LLMs are good at understanding natural language problems and decomposing them into steps, but make mistakes when doing the actual arithmetic reasoning or calculation.- By generating Python code as the intermediate steps, the role of calculation and execution can be offloaded from the LLM to the Python interpreter, playing to the strengths of each component.- This combined neuro-symbolic approach of LLM + code generation + external runtime will outperform approaches that rely solely on the LLM's reasoning capabilities.The paper tests this hypothesis across a range of mathematical, symbolic and algorithmic reasoning tasks, comparing the proposed Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) against baseline methods like chain-of-thought prompting that depend only on the LLM. The consistent improvements demonstrated by PAL across the benchmark tasks provide evidence supporting the core research hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), a novel approach that uses a large language model (LLM) to read natural language problems and generate programs as intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime like a Python interpreter. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using the LLM to decompose natural language problems into executable programmatic steps, but relying on the Python interpreter to actually run and solve each step. This allows leveraging the LLM's strength at language understanding while avoiding its weaknesses at arithmetic and reasoning.- Demonstrating this synergy between the neural LLM and symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic and algorithmic reasoning tasks. Across all tasks, generating code with the LLM and reasoning with the Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger LLMs using chain-of-thought prompting.- Showing state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on benchmarks like the GSM math word problems, where PAL outperforms a 540B parameter LLM by 15% absolute top-1 accuracy.- Analyzing the differences between neural text reasoning versus symbolic program execution, and showing PAL's benefits hold across varying LM sizes and with both code and natural language LMs.In summary, the key contribution is highlighting the importance of combining neural language models with symbolic interpreters for robust natural language reasoning, and introducing PAL as an effective approach for achieving this synergy. The results demonstrate improved reasoning accuracy across a diverse set of tasks and benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper: The paper proposes Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) which combine large language models that decompose natural language reasoning problems into executable program steps, with a Python runtime that actually executes those program steps to produce accurate answers.
