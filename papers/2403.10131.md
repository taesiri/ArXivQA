# [RAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- How to adapt pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for specialized domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, where the model must answer questions by extracting information from a fixed set of domain documents. 

- Existing methods have limitations:
   - RAG alone doesn't fully leverage the fixed domain during training.
   - Fine-tuning trains without accounting for imperfections of retrieval.
   - Current methods fail to properly combine fine-tuning with RAG.

Proposed Solution:
- Present Retrieval-Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) to tailor LLMs for domain RAG by training the model to:
   - Ignore distractor documents not useful for answering the question
   - Cite the right sequences from relevant documents  
   - Generate reasoning chains with citations to documents

- Mix training data: 80% of examples with oracle document + distractors, 20% with only distractors.

- Generate chain-of-thought style answers with quoted evidence.

Key Results:
- RAFT outperforms RAG, fine-tuning, and combination methods on multiple domain QA datasets (PubMed, HotpotQA, Gorilla).
- Ablations show importance of distractor docs and chain of thought.
- Analysis shows RAFT generalizes across varying numbers of retrieved docs.

Main Contributions:
- Novel fine-tuning recipe RAFT to specialize LLMs for domain RAG
- Demonstrates improved reasoning ability and information extraction
- Enhances robustness to imperfections in retrieval process
- Provides better training strategy for in-domain QA with LLMs

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed RAFT method, main results showing improvements, and contributions of adapting LLMs to domain RAG with a specialized fine-tuning approach. Let me know if any part needs more explanation or expansion.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary:

The paper proposes Retrieval-Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT), a training methodology to adapt pretrained language models for retrieval-augmented question answering in specialized domains by mixing oracle and distractor documents and generating chain-of-thought reasoning during fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel training strategy called Retrieval-Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT). Specifically:

- RAFT trains language models to answer questions by reading relevant passages from a set of documents and ignoring irrelevant "distractor" documents. This makes the model more robust to noise from imperfect retrievers at test time.

- RAFT shows consistent improvement over standard fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) across several QA datasets including PubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla.

- The paper analyzes design decisions like the proportion of training data that should contain the "oracle" document, and how many distractor documents to include during training.

- It introduces the analogy of preparing for an "open book exam" - RAFT combines the benefits of both studying the material (fine-tuning) as well as practicing to filter irrelevant information (training with distractors).

So in summary, RAFT contributes a novel fine-tuning technique to improve language models for in-domain question answering with retrieval augmentation, analyzed through both quantitative experiments and analogies. The consistent gains demonstrate the benefits of directly training models to handle imperfect retrievals.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Using a retriever module to provide additional in-domain context to a language model when generating responses.

- Domain Adaptation: Adapting a pretrained general language model to perform well on domain-specific tasks using the domain documents.

- Fine-Tuning: Further training/adapting a pretrained language model on downstream tasks and datasets. 

- Reading Comprehension: The ability of a language model to read and comprehend documents in order to answer questions.

- Reasoning: The ability of a language model to logically reason through documents and explain its responses. 

- Chain of Thought: A form of detailed, step-by-step reasoning that cites evidence from documents.

- Distractor Documents: Irrelevant documents mixed with relevant documents during training to improve robustness.

- In-Domain RAG: Applying retrieval augmented generation specifically in a specialized domain using domain-specific documents.

- Open-Book QA: Question answering where the model can access reference documents, akin to taking an exam with access to reference books.

The key focus of the paper is on adapting language models to perform well on in-domain RAG tasks through a fine-tuning approach called Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the RAFT method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that RAFT trains the model to identify relevant and irrelevant retrieved documents when answering a question, analogous to studying for an open-book exam. Can you expand more on this analogy? How exactly does RAFT simulate the imperfect retrieval process during training?

2. The paper demonstrates RAFT's ability to handle varying numbers of distractor documents at test time. How does mixing distractor and oracle documents during training help improve robustness? What is the ideal ratio of distractor to oracle documents?

3. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning appears central to RAFT's approach. What specific elements of the CoT answers are most essential? Have you experimented with alternate reasoning formats beyond CoT?

4. You highlight the performance gains from RAFT over domain-specific fine-tuning (DSF). What intrinsic issues with DSF does RAFT address? Are there any downsides introduced with RAFT's more complex training procedure?

5. The paper focuses on specialized domain documents for RAFT. How do you envision extending this to more open-domain question answering? What challenges arise in handling vastly more candidate documents?

6. You present promising results on diverse datasets like biomedical articles, software documentation, and Wikipedia. Are there any specific domains that seem particularly suitable or unsuitable for RAFT? Why?

7. The paper suggests potential privacy benefits from relying less on memorization with RAFT. Can you expand on the types of sensitive data that could be inadvertently encoded? How does RAFT mitigate exposure risks?

8. You use the LLaMA architecture as a base model. How does RAFT tailor the model adaptations to leverage LLaMA's strengths? Would you expect similar gains by applying RAFT to other model architectures?

9. The paper focuses on extracting short text snippets with RAFT. How do you envision extending it to tasks requiring synthesizing content from multiple document passages? What methodology changes would that require?

10. You propose RAFT as a post-training recipe for enhancing domain performance. Do you foresee directly incorporating some RAFT-like objectives into pre-training methodologies themselves in the future? What challenges would that introduction pose?
