## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions for zero-shot recognition:- Adopting a more generalized and realistic setting beyond just classifying new object classes. This includes being able to add new classes progressively without losing ability to recognize existing classes, and handling samples that could come from unknown unseen classes.- Combining zero-shot and few-shot learning more effectively, such as by treating class prototypes as 'super-shots' rather than just an extra training sample.- Going beyond just recognizing object categories to attributes and adjective-object combinations which have more complex relationships.- Incorporating curriculum learning principles to incrementally select suitable new classes to learn given the existing known classes.- Moving beyond static images to other areas like zero-shot learning of video events and activities.- Addressing limitations of existing models like the projection domain shift problem and hubness problem.- Using more advanced deep learning techniques for embedding models and zero-shot recognition frameworks.- Developing more standardized evaluation protocols and splits for zero-shot learning datasets.Overall, the key directions are towards more generalized, realistic settings and tasks, combining zero-shot and few-shot learning, addressing limitations of current models, and leveraging latest deep learning advances. The aim is to move from restrictive lab settings towards real-world lifelong learning applications.
