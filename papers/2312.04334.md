# [Towards a Perceptual Evaluation Framework for Lighting Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04334)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper questions the common practice of using image quality assessment (IQA) metrics to evaluate lighting estimation algorithms, arguing that they do not actually reflect human perception and preference. The authors perform a controlled psychophysical study comparing several recent lighting estimation methods by having human observers judge the accuracy and plausibility of rendered scenes. Their analysis shows that human judgement varies significantly depending on the task and type of materials used, whereas metrics yield very consistent scores. Furthermore, no single metric correlates well with human preference across all contexts; some even exhibit an inverse relationship. To address this, the authors propose learning a combination of metrics tailored to each experiment, which is shown to match human perception more closely through cross-validation. The paper demonstrates that commonly used IQA metrics are generally inadequate for perceptually evaluating lighting estimation algorithms, and that learning an ensemble of metrics is a more promising approach that better captures the nuances of human perception. It provides new insights and an evaluation framework to guide future work in this area towards metrics and algorithms that align better with human observers.
