# [TREC iKAT 2023: The Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT), which builds on previous work from the Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT) but with a greater emphasis on personalization and context in conversational search. 

Problem:
The key problem is enabling conversational search agents to provide responses tailored to an individual user's preferences, needs and prior knowledge. The same question may yield different optimal answers for different users depending on their personal context. This requires the agent to model the user and adapt over the course of a multi-turn conversation.

Proposed Solution: 
The track provides participants with a Personal Text Knowledge Base (PTKB) representing the user's background and persona. Systems must leverage this to provide personalized and contextually relevant responses. Two sample personas are given - Alice the environmentalist vegan and Bob with multiple dietary restrictions. Their conversations regarding milk alternatives would differ based on their distinct contexts.

The tasks involve (1) identifying relevant PTKB statements, (2) retrieving relevant passages, and (3) generating an appropriate response grounded in those passages. Both extractive and abstractive approaches are allowed for response generation.

Insights:
- Retrieve-then-generate (R→G) pipelines underperformed compared to generate-retrieve-then-generate (G→R→G) approaches, showing the value of first tapping large language models' knowledge before retrieving and grounding.

- PTKB statement ranking, while related, seems to be a distinct challenge from passage ranking, with different runs doing well on each.

- As with previous tracks, performance tended to degrade with more conversation turns. PTKB-dependence also introduced difficulty compared to non PTKB-dependent turns.

Main Contributions:
- New personalized conversational search framework and dataset based on ClueWeb passages
- Analysis of tradeoffs between different system pipeline architectures
- Novel tasks for leveraging personal knowledge in IR along with analysis of challenges
- Resources to spur research into personalized and contextually relevant conversational search

The paper introduces a new test collection to evaluate the challenges of providing truly tailored and useful conversational search experiences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT) introduces a new test collection and tasks for developing conversational search agents that can provide personalized and contextually relevant responses which evolve based on an understanding of the user's knowledge, preferences, and prior interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper introduces the TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT), which builds on prior work in the Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT) but has a greater focus on personalization and leveraging personal knowledge graphs/context to enable more tailored and relevant conversations. 

2. The paper describes the task, data, and resources developed through iKAT to study personalized conversational information seeking. This includes multi-turn conversational topics with personas, associated personal text knowledge bases (PTKBs), a passage collection, relevance judgments, etc.

3. The paper analyzes the results from the first year of the iKAT track. Key findings are that generate-retrieve-generate (GRG) pipelines outperformed retrieve-generate (RG) pipelines, indicating the value of first leveraging the internal knowledge of large language models before retrieving and grounding information.

4. The paper establishes benchmark results on the iKAT passage ranking, PTKB statement ranking, and response generation tasks using the datasets and resources introduced through the track.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing the iKAT track and task, developing associated datasets and resources for personalization in conversational search, and providing an analysis of participant results that yield both baseline numbers and insights on effective techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Conversational information seeking
- Personalized conversational agents 
- Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT)
- Personal text knowledge base (PTKB)
- Personal contexts
- Personalization 
- Elicitation
- Dependent relevance
- Passage ranking
- Response generation
- Statement ranking
- Personal knowledge graphs
- Retrieve then generate (R->G) 
- Generate, retrieve, then generate (G->R->G)

The paper introduces the TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT), which focuses on developing personalized conversational search agents. A key component is the use of a Personal Text Knowledge Base (PTKB) to represent a user's background information and preferences. The tasks involve passage ranking, statement ranking to identify relevant PTKB information, and response generation. Key research questions relate to handling personal contexts, personalization, eliciting persona details, and maintaining relevance using context and prior responses. The paper compares retrieve-then-generate (R->G) and generate-retrieve-then-generate (G->R->G) pipelines. So those are some of the central keywords and terminology highlighted in this overview paper for the TREC iKAT track.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new track called Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT). How is iKAT different from previous conversational search tracks like CAsT? What new challenges does it introduce?

2. One of the key components of iKAT is the Personal Text Knowledge Base (PTKB). What role does the PTKB play in personalizing the conversations? How was the PTKB generated and what information does it contain? 

3. The paper evaluates both retrieve-then-generate (R→G) and generate-retrieve-then-generate (G→R→G) pipelines. What are the relative advantages and limitations of each approach? Which one performed better overall in iKAT?

4. The paper uses large language models (LLMs) extensively. What different LLMs were used by participants and for what tasks in the pipeline (query rewriting, passage ranking, response generation etc.)? How were they fine-tuned?

5. What datasets were used by participants for training the different models in their pipelines? Were any new datasets created specifically for iKAT? If so, how?

6. How exactly was ground truth established for evaluating relevance of passages and PTKB statements? What was the pool depth and how were judgments obtained?

7. The paper evaluates both automatic and manual runs. What are the key differences in the manual runs? What role does human intervention play there? How much gain do manual runs achieve over automatic ones?

8. How was response quality, specifically groundedness, evaluated? Why was GPT-4 chosen for assessments instead of human judges? What biases could this introduce?

9. How does performance vary across different conversation turns? Is there a correlation between performance on PTKB relevance ranking and passage ranking tasks? How about across different topics?

10. What conclusions does the paper draw about relative effectiveness of different techniques for the tasks introduced in iKAT? What new research questions emerge from the track results?
