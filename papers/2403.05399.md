## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems in the convex case by analyzing the boundary value problem: finding $T$-periodic solutions $x(t)$ that satisfy Hamiltonian equations of motion with convex Hamiltonian $H(t,x)$.

Proposed Solution: 
- Uses a duality approach to transform the problem into minimizing a dual action functional $\psi(u)$. This yields an equivalent problem with better properties.

- Studies conditions on the Hamiltonian $H$ under which nontrivial $T$-periodic solutions are guaranteed to exist by analyzing the dual problem. 

- Derives estimates relating the period $T$ to properties of $H$ that ensure existence of non-constant solutions.

Main Contributions:

- Gives general conditions on $H$ for existence of nontrivial periodic solutions and provides approaches to find them by minimizing $\psi$.

- Studies autonomous and non-autonomous cases, with more specific results when $H$ is $(0,b_\infty)$-subquadratic.

- Presents various corollaries and estimates relating properties of $H$ (e.g. eigenvalues) to the period $T$ that guarantee periodic solutions.

- Proves a minimality result showing solutions found by minimizing $\psi$ have the minimal period $T$.

- Extends previous results by removing some constraints requiring growth conditions on $H’$ and considering only growth of $H$.

In summary, the main contribution is providing existence results, approaches to find solutions, and quantitative estimates relating Hamiltonian properties to the period $T$ to ensure periodic solutions in the convex case. The dual approach and minimality results are also novel.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content, it seems the main contribution of this paper is presenting results on the existence of periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems in the convex subquadratic case. Specifically:

- It presents results on the nontriviality and existence of periodic solutions for autonomous subquadratic Hamiltonian systems under certain conditions (Proposition 14, Corollary 2). 

- It provides a refined version of previous results by Smith and Waterman on the existence of periodic solutions, including a new minimality result (Proposition 14).

- It discusses conditions for the existence of subharmonics for forced Hamiltonian systems.

- It defines the concept of (A∞,B∞)-subquadratic Hamiltonians.

So in summary, the key contributions appear to be the new theoretical results on periodic and subharmonic solutions to convex subquadratic Hamiltonian systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a duality approach to treat periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems in the convex-subquadratic case. Can you explain in more detail how this duality approach works and why it is advantageous? 

2. The notion of an "(A∞,B∞)-subquadratic Hamiltonian" is introduced. Can you provide some intuition about what this represents and why it is a useful concept when studying periodic solutions?

3. Proposition 14 states a nontriviality condition involving the quantities λ, γ, and δ. Can you interpret the meaning of this condition geometrically or physically? 

4. The integer part function E[α] plays an important role in Corollaries 2 and 3. What is the significance of this function and how does it connect to the existence of non-constant periodic solutions?

5. The authors claim the minimality result in Proposition 14 was the first of its kind. What is novel about this minimality result and what are its implications?

6. In what sense does the linearized system at 0, whose period is mentioned in the closing paragraph, represent a limiting case of the proposed approach?

7. Theorem 21 is cited in the proof of Proposition 14, but the full statement of Theorem 21 is not included. What can you infer about Theorem 21 from its application?

8. How would you extend the results to deal with external forcing as described in Example 1? What additional assumptions would be required?

9. Definition 8 introduces the terminology of (A∞,B∞)-subquadratic Hamiltonians. Provide some examples of functions that do or do not satisfy this definition. 

10. The notes at the end mention recent progress involving symmetry arguments and pinching estimates. Can you incorporate ideas from topological dynamics to strengthen or expand upon the results?
