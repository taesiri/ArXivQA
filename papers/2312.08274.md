## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for high-throughput biomedical relation extraction from semi-structured web articles. The key idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) in a question-answering format to classify whether a given entity-entity pair expresses a particular semantic relation, aided by contextual passages retrieved from the web article. Specifically, the main title of a web page is designated as the tail entity, and candidate head entities are matched biomedical terms in the article text. To handle long texts, embedding-based chunk retrieval retains only the most relevant contexts. The LLMs then make binary relation decisions and provide explanatory reasoning to minimize hallucination risks. Evaluations using expert annotations show the pipeline with open-source LLMs rivals commercial models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. When applied for extraction across four major medical websites, over 300,000 biomedical relation triplets spanning three relation types are obtained to augment ontologies. The proposed framework is highly scalable, requiring no labeled data or model retraining for new websites or relations. Case studies also reveal limitations of LLMs for complex judgments. Overall, this work successfully demonstrates the promise of synergistically applying LLMs and knowledge graphs to advance biomedical information retrieval.
