# [Operator SVD with Neural Networks via Nested Low-Rank Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Computing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a large matrix or linear operator is fundamental in many machine learning and scientific computing applications. However, standard numerical methods are computationally expensive or infeasible for large-scale, high-dimensional problems. Therefore, new efficient algorithms are needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new optimization framework called NeuralSVD to learn the top singular/eigen functions of a linear operator using neural networks. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate the problem as low-rank approximation (LoRA) of the operator to characterize the singular value subspaces. This avoids explicit orthogonality constraints.

2) Introduce "nesting" techniques to break symmetry and learn the functions ordered by singular values. Two versions are proposed - sequential and joint nesting.

3) Estimate gradients without bias for stable optimization. Custom loss functions and backward passes are designed.

The framework is model-agnostic and works for any parametric functions. Easy to implement with modern deep learning libraries.

Main Contributions:

- New optimization perspective to structured function learning problems based on LoRA
- Nesting techniques to recover ordered solutions
- Ability to perform SVD and handle non-self-adjoint operators, unlike prior NN-based EVD methods
- Efficient and scalable implementation without complex constraints or regularization 

Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on solving PDEs and cross-domain retrieval compared to alternatives. Overall, an important step towards making spectral methods practical for large modern datasets and simulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes NeuralSVD, an optimization framework based on low-rank approximation that employs neural networks as function approximators and nesting techniques to efficiently learn the top-L singular values and singular functions of an operator in the correct order.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new optimization framework called NeuralSVD for learning the top singular functions of an operator using neural networks. The key contributions are:

1) It introduces a low-rank approximation (LoRA) objective that can be optimized to learn the top singular subspaces in an unconstrained manner. This is more efficient than existing methods that use constraints. 

2) It proposes "nesting" techniques to break symmetry in the LoRA objective and learn the singular functions in the correct order of significance. This includes sequential nesting and joint nesting methods. 

3) It demonstrates the effectiveness of NeuralSVD for two applications - solving differential equations in physics and cross-domain retrieval tasks in machine learning. Experiments show it outperforms prior parametric methods like SpIN and NeuralEF.

4) The optimization framework is simple to implement and scales more efficiently for larger number of modes compared to alternatives. It also naturally handles SVD of non-self-adjoint operators unlike SpIN/NeuralEF that only do EVD.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient unconstrained optimization framework to learn ordered singular functions using neural networks, enabled by the LoRA objective and nesting techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Operator SVD: Singular value decomposition for compact linear operators between Hilbert spaces. Allows decomposition of non-self-adjoint operators.

- Neural networks: Used to parametrize the singular functions. Enables decomposition of operators defined over large, high-dimensional spaces.

- Low-rank approximation: The paper uses Schmidt's theorem on optimal low-rank approximation to derive an unconstrained objective function for learning the top singular functions. 

- Nesting: New techniques introduced in the paper to learn the singular functions and values in the correct order. Two versions proposed - sequential and joint.

- Eigenvalue decomposition: Shown to be a special case of operator SVD when the operator is self-adjoint.

- Computational physics: One application area is solving eigenvalue problems arising from time-independent Schr√∂dinger equations.

- Cross-domain retrieval: Another application in representation learning and cross-modal retrieval using the canonical dependence kernel.

- Unbiased gradients: The proposed framework allows unbiased gradient estimates for efficient optimization.

Key aspects are the use of neural networks and low-rank approximation theory to decompose operators, combined with nesting techniques to recover the modes correctly. Tested on problems in physics and representation learning.
