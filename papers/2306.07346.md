# [Learning to Mask and Permute Visual Tokens for Vision Transformer   Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07346)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve upon existing self-supervised pre-training objectives like masked image modeling (MIM) to learn better visual representations for downstream tasks?

The authors motivate this question by identifying some limitations of the prevalent MIM approach, which masks random patches of an image and tries to reconstruct those patches based on the unmasked context. Specifically, MIM introduces input noise during pre-training and assumes independence between reconstructed patches. 

To address these issues, the authors propose a novel pre-training technique called Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT), which combines masking and permutation strategies along with additional position embeddings. The key ideas are:

- Use permuted (rather than masked) predictions to capture inter-patch dependencies in an auto-regressive manner

- Incorporate learnable position embeddings to provide full position information during pre-training, avoiding discrepancies with fine-tuning

- Employ two-stream self-attention to implement the permutation strategy in a vision transformer backbone

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed MaPeT pre-training approach can learn improved visual representations compared to MIM and other existing methods by overcoming some of their limitations. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel self-supervised pre-training approach called MaPeT (Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer) that combines masked and permuted image modeling strategies. 

- Introducing a permutation-based pre-training objective called Permuted Image Modeling (PIM) that autoregressively predicts permuted image patches while maintaining contextual bi-directionality.

- Presenting Masked and Permuted pre-training for Vision Transformers (MaPeT) that uses PIM to capture intra-patch dependency and takes auxiliary position information as input to ensure the model sees a full sequence of patches at each target position.

- Proposing a new discrete tokenizer called $k$-CLIP that employs discretized CLIP features as visual tokens without requiring training an autoencoder, enabling pre-training without labeled data.

- Conducting experiments under fair and consistent settings to evaluate the proposed method against baselines and competitors. The results demonstrate MaPeT's competitive performance on ImageNet image classification.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a novel pre-training approach MaPeT that combines masked and permuted image modeling along with a new tokenizer $k$-CLIP, and showing through fair experiments that this method achieves strong performance on downstream vision tasks.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different permutation strategies beyond uniform random ordering. The authors suggest trying other permutation schemes like gradual increase in sequence length or structurally meaningful orderings based on image semantics.

- Investigating different auxiliary input modalities beyond positional embeddings, such as discrete masked tokens or continuous gaussian noise vectors. Providing richer auxiliary inputs during pre-training could further enhance the learned representations.

- Applying the proposed pre-training approach to other backbone architectures besides Vision Transformers, like ConvNets. The authors anticipate the method may transfer well to other architectures.

- Adapting the technique to video domains by permuting and predicting spatio-temporal visual tokens. Extending this approach to videos is a promising direction.

- Exploring the combination of mask-based and permutation-based pre-training objectives within a single model. Finding optimal ways to integrate both strategies could lead to further gains.

- Analyzing the impact of different tokenizers, like discrete autoencoders over other self-supervised signals beyond CLIP features. Better tokenizers may improve overall performance.

- Scaling up the approach to even larger datasets, longer training, and bigger models. Larger-scale implementation could further boost results.

- Evaluating the method on a wider range of downstream tasks beyond image classification. Assessing broader task generalization is important future work.

So in summary, the authors propose multiple exciting avenues like studying different permutation strategies, auxiliary inputs, architectures, modalities, training objectives, tokenizers, model scales, and tasks. Advancing the technique along these dimensions can potentially yield further improvements in the future.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new self-supervised pre-training approach for vision transformers called Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT). Instead of masking patches like in Masked Image Modeling (MIM), MaPeT uses a permutation-based modeling strategy called Permuted Image Modeling (PIM) where patches are predicted in an autoregressive manner based on a permuted order while maintaining bidirectional context. This captures dependencies between patches better than MIM. However, PIM loses some positional information during pre-training. To address this, MaPeT incorporates learnable mask tokens that provide positional information about all patches as additional input. The model is trained with a two-stream self-attention mechanism to separate content and positional information. The paper also introduces a visual tokenizer called k-CLIP that clusters CLIP image features to generate discrete tokens representing semantic concepts. Experiments show MaPeT outperforms MIM, PIM, and other self-supervised methods on ImageNet classification for vision transformers when using the same architectures and training configurations. The k-CLIP tokenizer also outperforms alternatives, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CLIP features. Overall, the work provides a promising permutation-based pre-training approach and visual tokenizer for self-supervised learning in computer vision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new self-supervised pre-training approach called Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT) for visual representation learning. The method combines masked image modeling, which reconstructs randomly masked image patches, with a novel permuted image modeling strategy. Permuted image modeling predicts image patches in an autoregressive manner based on a random permutation of the patches while maintaining bidirectional contextual information. This captures dependencies between patches while avoiding input corruption. However, permuted modeling reduces available positional information during pre-training. To address this, MaPeT incorporates auxiliary positional embeddings as input to provide full positional information for each patch. 

MaPeT employs two-stream self-attention during pre-training, with separate content and query streams. The content stream encodes all patch content while the query stream lacks content of the predicted patch. Attention masking limits visibility. For visual targets, the method introduces k-CLIP, which uses k-means clustering of CLIP image features to generate discrete tokens without dataset-specific training. Experiments under controlled settings validate MaPeT's performance, demonstrating improvements over masked and permuted modeling alone. MaPeT with k-CLIP outperforms baselines on ImageNet classification, showing the effectiveness of the pre-training objective and discrete tokenizer.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new self-supervised pre-training approach for vision transformers called Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT). MaPeT combines elements of masked image modeling (MIM) and permuted image modeling (PIM) to overcome limitations of using them independently. Specifically, it employs a permuted prediction approach to capture intra-patch dependencies and uses auxiliary positional embeddings as input to provide full positional information during pre-training. This helps resolve the pre-training/fine-tuning discrepancy introduced by permutation-based methods like PIM. The model consists of two attention streams - a content stream that encodes both context and target patches, and a query stream that lacks target patch content. The query stream output is used during pre-training, while only the content stream is used during fine-tuning. Attention masking limits visibility in each stream. Additionally, the paper introduces a $k$-CLIP tokenizer that generates discrete visual tokens directly from clustered CLIP features without needing dataset-specific training. Experiments show MaPeT provides improved performance on image classification over MIM and PIM baselines.
