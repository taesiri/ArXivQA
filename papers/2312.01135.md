# [Vision-based FDM Printing for Fabricating Airtight Soft Actuators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01135)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pneumatic soft robots are typically fabricated by manual molding processes which are time-consuming and require skilled labor. 
- Additive manufacturing like fused deposition modeling (FDM) could speed up fabrication but struggles to consistently produce high-quality, airtight prints needed for pneumatic actuators.
- Existing methods to improve FDM print quality are insufficient for flexible filaments (shore hardness <95A) and can't handle random defects from filament variability.

Proposed Solution:
- A closed-loop FDM printing system to detect and correct permeability defects in real-time through vision-based monitoring after each printed layer.
- Uses a camera mounted on the print head to capture images of each layer.
- Custom software parses G-code into layers, inserts capture commands, detects defects in images, and generates corrective toolpaths. 
- Defective layers are corrected by ironing the layer at lower speeds and flow rates to remelt material.

Main Contributions:
- Hardware and software system for real-time vision monitoring and correction during FDM printing.
- Algorithm to detect gaps/holes in captured layer images using contour projections, thresholding and filtering.
- Whole layer ironing method to correct defects without needing precise calibration.
- Experiments showing closed-loop printing reduces leakage rates of bellows soft actuators under various print parameters.
- Approach enables more reliable fabrication of airtight soft pneumatic structures with desktop FDM.

The key insight is using real-time visual feedback after each layer to detect and fill defects through remelting before they compromise the print. This improves reliability without tedious parameter tuning.
