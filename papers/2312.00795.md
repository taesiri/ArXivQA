# [Talent-Interview: Web-Client Cheating Detection for Online Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Online exams and interviews are becoming more popular, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is an increased risk of cheating in online assessments compared to in-person exams. Manual proctoring of every exam is costly. Therefore, there is a need for automated systems that can detect potential cheating in online exams and interviews.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an end-to-end cheating detection system that runs on the client/user's machine rather than the server. This eliminates server costs, risks of overloading, security concerns with user data on the server, and allows real-time functioning of ML models. The system uses computer vision and audio processing models to detect suspicious behaviors like use of mobile phones, presence of multiple people, and background voices. 

Key aspects:
- Face recognition using facial vectors to detect identity changes
- Object detection through COCO-SSD MobileNetV2 model to detect phones, laptops 
- Voice detection model using spectrograms and deep network to detect human voices
- Image segmentation using BodyPix to blur background for privacy

Main Contributions:
- Upgraded face detection API for better stability 
- Leveraged pre-trained object detection model without requiring training
- Added audio detection capabilities to identify background sounds
- Overall end-to-end cheating detection pipeline running on client machine with no server-side processing

The system aims to automatically detect potential cheating behaviors during online exams and interviews. By running on the client machine, it eliminates many of the costs, risks and privacy concerns associated with server-based solutions. The use of facial recognition, object detection and voice detection provides capabilities to identify several common cheating behaviors.
