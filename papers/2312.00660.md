# [Resource-constrained knowledge diffusion processes inspired by human   peer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00660)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a "natural Knowledge Diffusion" (nKDiff) framework that models human peer learning processes to train a population of neural network models under constraints on training resources like access to true labels and time budgets. The key idea is to have models act as teachers for each other, providing their own "pseudo labels" to other models during training rounds, in addition to occasional access to true labels from an "Oracle" model. The paper shows that despite using inconsistent pseudo labels from imperfect peer teachers, nKDiff makes efficient use of limited true labels and enables faster learning compared to only using the Oracle. Surprisingly, uncoordinated peer groupings also work, eventually approaching the performance of coordinated policies based on model evaluations. Experiments on image classification and graph data demonstrate how, unlike regular training, nKDiff prevents overfitting to random or noisy labels. And viewed as an ensemble learner, nKDiff appears to naturally compose simple learning modules into a model that generalizes without memorizing. The framework offers a new way to study generalization phenomena and reveals how overparameterization and stochasticity may be key resources.
