# [pFedES: Model Heterogeneous Personalized Federated Learning with Feature   Extractor Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "pFedES: Model Heterogeneous Personalized Federated Learning with Feature Extractor Sharing":

Problem: 
Existing federated learning (FL) methods assume all clients train models with the same structure (model homogeneity). However, in practice clients often have heterogeneous data, computing resources, and model requirements. To allow personalized and heterogeneous local model training, the field of model-heterogeneous personalized FL (MHPFL) has emerged. However, existing MHPFL methods have limitations like dependence on public datasets, high communication/computation costs, and privacy risks.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel MHPFL approach called pFedES that incorporates a small homogeneous feature extractor into each client's heterogeneous model. Clients train the extractor and model iteratively via freeze-train steps to exchange global and local knowledge. Only the lightweight extractors are shared across clients to enable knowledge transfer while preserving privacy.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes pFedES, an efficient MHPFL approach that achieves personalized model training via sharing small homogeneous feature extractors  
- Designs an iterative freeze-train method to effectively transfer global and local knowledge between the shared extractor and personalized heterogeneous model
- Provides theoretical analysis to prove the convergence over wall-to-wall time under non-convex objectives
- Conducts extensive experiments on CIFAR showing pFedES achieves the highest accuracy and strikes the best tradeoff between communication, computation costs and accuracy

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in making progress towards efficient and personalized federated learning under practical model heterogeneity constraints. The proposed pFedES approach incorporates feature extractor sharing as an effective knowledge transfer bridge across heterogeneous models, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a personalized federated learning approach called pFedES that enables clients to train heterogeneous local models while sharing knowledge through small homogeneous feature extractors that are aggregated on a central server.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning (MHPFL) approach called pFedES. Specifically:

- pFedES incorporates a small homogeneous feature extractor into each client's heterogeneous local model. Clients train these models via an iterative learning method to enable exchange of global generalized knowledge and local personalized knowledge. 

- Only the small homogeneous feature extractors are aggregated on the server to facilitate knowledge sharing while preserving privacy and reducing communication costs.

- Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of pFedES.

- Experiments show pFedES achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines, while incurring much lower communication and computation costs. For example, compared to the best baseline, pFedES improves test accuracy by 1.61%, while reducing communication and computation costs by 99.6% and 82.9% respectively.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing pFedES, an efficient MHPFL approach that enables model heterogeneity across clients, while achieving high accuracy and preserving privacy with low communication and computation overhead.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning (MHPFL): Enabling each client to train a personalized and heterogeneous model based on its local data distribution, system resources, and model structure requirements.

- Feature extractor sharing: Incorporating a small homogeneous feature extractor into each client's heterogeneous local model. Clients train the feature extractors and models iteratively to exchange knowledge. Only the feature extractors are shared between clients to facilitate collaboration while preserving privacy.

- Iterative training method: Freezing either the feature extractor or local model alternatively while training the other in order to transfer knowledge between them.

- Convergence analysis: Mathematically analyzing and proving the convergence rate of the proposed pFedES approach. 

- Communication efficiency: Greatly reducing communication costs by only transmitting small feature extractors rather than full models between clients and server.

- Computation efficiency: Limiting the additional computation costs for clients by using a small CNN as the homogenenous feature extractor.

- Personalization: Allowing each client to learn a personalized model tailored to its local data distribution while still collaborating with other clients.

In summary, the key focus is on efficient and personalized federated learning through sharing small feature extractors between heterogeneous models rather than the full models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the pFedES method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that pFedES incorporates a small homogeneous feature extractor into each client's heterogeneous local model. What motivated this specific design choice to include a feature extractor rather than some other model component? How does this facilitate knowledge transfer?

2. In the iterative training procedure, what is the intuition behind first freezing the feature extractor and training the local model, versus the reverse order? How does each step facilitate global-to-local and local-to-global knowledge transfer? 

3. The loss function for training the local models includes a weighted combination of losses from the original data and enhanced data (Eq 3). What is the rationale behind using a weighted combination rather than just the loss from the enhanced data?

4. What were some alternative structures considered for the homogeneous feature extractor, and why was the small CNN with two convolutional layers chosen? How do you think performance would change with a larger or more complex extractor?

5. Theoretical analysis shows that pFedES converges at a rate of O(1/T). How does this compare to convergence rates for other personalized federated learning methods? Could you further analyze convergence for non-IID or unbalanced data distributions?

6. What advantages does pFedES provide over knowledge distillation-based personalized federated learning methods in terms of privacy preservation and efficiency? Could distillation loss also be incorporated into pFedES?

7. The experiments show strong personalization in the local models trained by pFedES. What properties of pFedES contribute to preserving personalization while still transferring global knowledge? Could you further analyze or visualize this?  

8. Under what conditions would you expect pFedES to outperform/underperform standalone local training or other personalized federation learning methods? Could you design additional experiments to demonstrate this?

9. How could pFedES be extended to other tasks beyond image classification, such as natural language processing or speech recognition? Would the same feature extractor design work effectively?

10. The paper mentions optimizing the feature extractor structure and training procedure as future work. What improvements do you think could be made to the feature extractor and training steps to further improve efficiency and performance?
