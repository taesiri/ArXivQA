# [Concept Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current discussions around AI alignment focus on "value alignment", meaning creating AI systems that share human values. However, before we can align values, we first need "concept alignment", meaning AI systems and humans need to understand the world using the same concepts. 

- There are good reasons to think AI systems currently have very different conceptual understandings than humans. Examples include AI calling black people non-human primates, a self-driving car killing a jaywalking pedestrian because it didn't understand the concept of crossing informally, and an AI learning "wolf" means the snow, not the animal.

- Language itself does not guarantee shared meaning (concepts). The "gavagai problem" illustrates language fundamentally underdetermines meaning - the same word can refer to infinite possible meanings.

Proposed Solution:
- First achieve concept alignment, then value alignment. Concept alignment means AI and humans share grounded, multimodal concepts like "apple" in a similar way to how humans share concepts.

- Use cognitive science to set goals for concept alignment based on how humans acquire concepts over development. Use empirical tools from AI research like grounded language models and interactive learning to achieve these goals.

- Concept alignment enables natural language communication between humans and AI that is functionally equivalent to communication between humans.

Main Contributions:
- Articulated the need to align concepts before values to enable human-AI value alignment

- Proposed using cognitive science and AI tools to set goals and empirically measure concept alignment 

- Outlined a path forward to achieve concept alignment through grounded language and interactive learning


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper's key argument:

The authors argue that concept alignment between humans and AI, meaning a shared understanding of the concepts used to comprehend the world, is a necessary prerequisite for the more complex goal of value alignment between humans and AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the idea of "concept alignment" between humans and AI systems. Specifically:

1) The paper argues that concept alignment, meaning a shared conceptual understanding of the world, is a necessary prerequisite for value alignment between humans and AI. It explains why shared concepts are important for communication and cooperation.

2) The paper explains challenges in achieving concept alignment, drawing on ideas like Quine's indeterminacy of translation in philosophy. It discusses differences in how humans vs machines currently learn concepts. 

3) The paper outlines concrete goals, tools, and opportunities for making progress on concept alignment, integrating perspectives from philosophy, cognitive science, and AI research. This includes using measures from cognitive science to evaluate concept alignment, and using techniques like grounded language learning to improve alignment.

4) The paper introduces the notion of concept alignment and makes the case that it is a vital but under-appreciated aspect of the broader AI alignment challenge. It provides a framework for further interdisciplinary research towards achieving concept alignment between humans and intelligent machines.

In summary, the key contribution is explicating the importance of concept alignment, which provides a more concrete goal compared to the vague notion of "value alignment", and charting a path forward for work in this direction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Concept alignment - The main idea proposed in the paper, referring to the need for AI systems and humans to align on the concepts they use to understand the world before attempting to align values.

- Value alignment - The common notion in AI safety discourse that AI systems should be created to share human values. The authors argue concept alignment is a prerequisite.  

- Incommensurability - The idea from philosophy that two conceptual frameworks can be so divergent that they cannot meaningfully compare or evaluate each other. Used to argue why concept alignment matters.

- Semantic indeterminacy - The thesis from philosophy that translation and meaning are ultimately indeterminate. Raises challenges for assuming shared meaning from language alone. 

- Gavagai argument - A thought experiment illustrating Quine's idea of the indeterminacy of translation. Questions if we can ever truly know concepts of another based on language.

- Symbol grounding - The challenge of linking symbols like words to real-world phenomena, related to concept learning.

- Interpretability - An AI safety subfield aiming to characterize AI systems in human-understandable terms, an important step for concept alignment.

- Interactive alignment - A cognitive science theory arguing successful communication relies on aligning processing across levels, including conceptually.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with the need for conceptual alignment between humans and AI, the challenges of indeterminacy, and leverage points like grounding and interaction to make progress.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors argue that concept alignment is a prerequisite for value alignment between humans and AI systems. What are some of the key challenges they identify in achieving value alignment without first having concept alignment? How might concept alignment help address those challenges?

2. The paper draws an analogy between concept alignment in humans vs. AI and examples of incommensurability in the history of science, like between Aristotelian and Newtonian physics. In what ways are the conceptual differences between humans and current AI systems potentially similarly catastrophic or concerning?

3. The authors argue that language use alone is not sufficient proof of concept alignment. What is Quine's thesis of semantic indeterminacy and how does the "gavagai argument" illustrate issues with assuming shared meaning from language use? 

4. What role does the symbol grounding problem play in concept alignment? How might grounding in sensory modalities help align concepts between humans and AI systems?

5. The paper discusses Quinian bootstrapping as a theory of how humans acquire concepts. How might this theory inform approaches to grounding concepts in AI systems? What evidence is there that neural networks may learn concepts similarly?

6. What tools from interpretability research could be useful for evaluating and improving concept alignment? How could they help verify claims of alignment or identify misalignment?

7. The paper argues concept alignment should be interactive, not static. What evidence is there from cognitive science that interaction helps align conceptual understandings between humans? How can we translate those findings to human-AI interaction?

8. What specific measures from cognitive science are proposed in the paper as ways to quantify the degree of concept alignment between two agents? How could those measures be applied to evaluate human-AI alignment? 

9. The authors argue for setting concept alignment goals informed by studies of human development and prototype theory from cognitive science. What would such a standard look like for a basic concept like "apple" and how might it become more complex for abstract concepts?  

10. How could existing techniques like human-in-the-loop learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback be extended to improve concept-level alignment through interaction? What limitations do current approaches have?
