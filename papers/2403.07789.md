# [RobotCycle: Assessing Cycling Safety in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07789)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cyclists remain vulnerable road users, exposed to risks from road infrastructure, unpredictable behavior of other road users, and inadequate safety measures. In 2022, there were 15,693 cyclist casualties in the UK.
- Existing methods to analyze cycling safety rely on post-event reporting or stationary sensors with limited perspectives. They lack crucial contextual details surrounding critical events.

Proposed Solution: 
- The RobotCycle project aims to assess how cycling infrastructure and interactions with other road users influence cyclist behavior and safety during real-world journeys.
- They design a novel wearable multi-sensor backpack to capture 360-degree data from a cyclistâ€™s perspective during journeys across diverse traffic conditions and infrastructure.
- The backpack contains LiDARs, cameras, IMUs and GPS to map detailed environments, capture traffic interactions, and track trajectories of road agents.
- They collect a new diverse and richly annotated dataset from cyclist perspectives across varying infrastructure.
- They extract HD maps, perform semantic annotation, and develop trajectory prediction models to enable detailed analysis of infrastructure, behavior and interactions influencing safety. 

Main Contributions:
- Novel sensing backpack to collect diverse 360-degree cyclist perspective data 
- New extensively annotated dataset analyzing cycling safety
- Approach to extract HD maps, semantics, trajectories and traffic models  
- Methodology to correlate infrastructure, behavior and interactions to comprehensively assess cycling safety
- Benchmark to quantify risk levels of infrastructure to promote cycling safety

The paper details the objectives, requirements, system design, data collection methodology, and preliminary analysis results towards the goal of assessing cycling safety through contextual data-driven techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 RobotCycle is a project that uses a wearable multi-sensor backpack to collect cyclist data for analyzing infrastructure safety by extracting high-definition maps, traffic models, and trajectory predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The RobotCycle project proposes a novel data-driven approach to assess cycling infrastructure safety by leveraging autonomous vehicle research and technologies. Specifically, the project:

1) Designs a customizable multi-sensor backpack to capture 360-degree data from a cyclist's perspective during real-world journeys. This allows collecting a comprehensive dataset capturing infrastructure details, traffic interactions, and road user behaviors.

2) Develops a methodology and requirements for a diverse and richly annotated dataset focused on cycling safety factors like infrastructure elements, traffic volumes, road layouts, and interactions.

3) Proposes safety and cyclability benchmarking based on HD maps, trajectory prediction, and data analysis to identify risky situations and infrastructure issues. This can inform strategies to enhance cyclist protection and promote sustainable urban mobility.

In summary, the main contribution is a data-driven approach and benchmarking methodology to assess and improve cycling safety in cities by leveraging AV technologies to collect and analyze data from the perspective of vulnerable road users. The project aims to generate insights to design cycling-friendly infrastructure.
