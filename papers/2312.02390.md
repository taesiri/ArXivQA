# [The Impact of Robots' Facial Emotional Expressions on Light Physical   Exercises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Population aging is a global challenge. Introducing robots that can assist older adults with physical activities and light exercises could enhance their wellbeing.  
- Facial expressions have been shown to increase engagement when interacting with robots in social contexts. However, their impact in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) scenarios is underexplored. 

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a user study with 27 older adults (ages 66-88) interacting with a robotic arm (Sawyer) equipped with a screen to display facial expressions. 
- Investigate 3 conditions: no facial expressions, unresponsive facial expressions (static happy face), and responsive facial expressions (that change based on user's performance).
- Explore the impact of facial expressions on older adults' perception of the robot's competence, warmth, discomfort, safety and their engagement levels.

Main Contributions:
- Facial expressions negatively impacted people's perception of the robot's competence in the pHRI exercise scenario.
- Facial expressions did not significantly influence older adults' engagement levels, unlike in social human-robot interaction settings.  
- Perception of safety, competence and warmth was influenced by people's baseline anxiety, stress levels, engagement with the robot, and trust.
- The correlations varied across conditions, needing further investigation.  

Impact:
- Facial expressions may not be the most suitable non-verbal behavior to enhance engagement in pHRI focused on collaborative tasks rather than sociability. 
- More research needed on developing social skills for physically interactive robots across various applications.
