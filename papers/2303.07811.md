# [ICICLE: Interpretable Class Incremental Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07811)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an interpretable approach to class-incremental learning that reduces catastrophic forgetting while maintaining consistent explanations over time?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new method called Interpretable Class-Incremental Learning (ICICLE) for incremental learning of new classes without forgetting previous ones. 

- ICICLE is based on prototypical parts, which are interpretable by design. This allows the model to provide explanations through prototype-based reasoning.

- A core challenge is that the rationale behind model predictions can change over time as new classes are learned, leading to "interpretability concept drift". This makes explanations inconsistent. 

- To address this, ICICLE incorporates several mechanisms:
  - Interpretability regularization to distill old concepts while allowing new learning
  - Proximity-based prototype initialization to leverage previous prototypes
  - Task-recency bias compensation to balance prototype importance

- Experiments show ICICLE reduces interpretability drift and outperforms baseline continual learning methods on standard benchmarks. 

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that an interpretable class-incremental learner based on prototypes can be developed that maintains consistent explanations while reducing catastrophic forgetting. The paper introduces ICICLE to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper appears to be a template for submitting papers to the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). The main content is placeholders and formatting instructions for writing an ICCV paper. It does not contain any actual research contributions. The main things this template provides are:

- Formatting instructions for an ICCV paper (two-column, 10pt font, etc.)

- Example LaTeX code for including common things like figures, tables, equations, references, etc.

- Instructions for camera-ready submission vs initial submission (removing page numbers, etc.)

- Placeholder content like a fake title, authors, abstract, sections, figures, tables, etc. to demonstrate how a paper should be structured.

So in summary, this is just a template that shows the expected formatting and structure of an ICCV paper. It does not contain any actual research or contributions itself - those would need to be added by the authors writing a real research paper for submission to the conference. The main contribution is providing a starting point and guidelines for formatting a paper to submit to ICCV.
