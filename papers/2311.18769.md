# [Online Change Points Detection for Linear Dynamical Systems with Finite   Sample Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18769)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper studies the problem of online change point detection for linear dynamical systems, where the goal is to detect abrupt changes in the system parameters as soon as possible. The authors develop an algorithm based on solving regularized least squares problems over a reference window and test window of data. A key contribution is the derivation of a data-dependent threshold for detecting change points that provides finite sample guarantees on both false alarm and true alarm probabilities. Specifically, the threshold allows the user to specify an upper bound on false alarm probability. The authors further analytically characterize the trade-off between detection accuracy and delay by lower bounding the probability of true alarm as a function of parameters like the window size. A key finding is that using a larger window size leads to higher true alarm probability but also higher detection delay. The results are demonstrated on a numerical example of detecting changes in a linearized UAV model. Overall, this paper makes important theoretical contributions on change point detection for dynamical systems by providing performance guarantees and explicitly characterizing the accuracy-delay tradeoff.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides an online change point detection algorithm for linear dynamical systems with theoretical guarantees on minimizing false alarms and detecting true change points with bounded delay.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides an online change point detection algorithm for linear dynamical systems that is suitable for multiple change points. The algorithm is based on a least squares approach and can be easily implemented. 

2. It develops a data-dependent threshold that can be used in the algorithm's test. This threshold enables achieving a pre-specified upper bound on the probability of false alarm, without requiring perfect knowledge of the system parameters at any time.

3. It provides a finite-sample-based lower bound for the probability of detecting a change point. This bound demonstrates the trade-off between accurate detection and detection delay, as well as the ability to detect fast changes.

In summary, the paper presents an online change point detection algorithm for dynamical systems and provides theoretical guarantees on its performance in terms of balancing false alarms and true detections, as well as characterizing the detection delay. The analysis applies for multiple change points and does not require knowing the exact system parameters.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper develops a threshold $\gamma_k$ that depends on parameters like $b_{\sigma_w}$ and $b_{\Theta}$. How sensitive is the performance of the algorithm to inaccuracies in the estimates of these parameters? Can you analyze or bound the degradation in performance?

2. Theorem 1 provides a finite sample bound on the probability of false alarm. Can you extend the analysis to obtain asymptotic results as the number of samples grows? 

3. How would you extend the analysis to systems with different noise distributions beyond Gaussian? What new challenges need to be addressed?

4. The paper assumes full state measurements. How would the method and analysis change for partially observed systems? What are some ways to approach this?

5. The dynamics after change points are assumed to be time-invariant. How could the method be extended to detect more complex changes, like time-varying or state-dependent dynamics?

6. What is the computational complexity of the method? Are there ways to improve efficiency for high-dimensional systems? 

7. The analysis provides guidance on choosing the window length N, but does not optimize over N. Is it possible to automatically adapt N in an online data-driven way?

8. How does the presence of unmodelled dynamics or disturbances affect the guarantees? Can you characterize robustness?

9. The method detects isolated change points. How could it be extended to detect clusters of close change points? What limits the resolution?

10. The method uses a least-squares approach. Can the method be kernelized or adapted using modern machine learning approaches? How might the analysis need to change?
