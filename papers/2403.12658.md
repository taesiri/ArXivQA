# [Tuning-Free Image Customization with Image and Text Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing image customization methods using diffusion models have several limitations:
1) Unintended changes in non-target areas when regenerating the entire image.  
2) Guidance solely by a reference image or text descriptions.  
3) Time-consuming fine-tuning, limiting practical applications.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a tuning-free framework for simultaneous text-image guided image customization that enables precise editing of specific image regions within seconds. The key ideas are:

1) Utilize both text descriptions and a reference image to guide the image customization in the target region(s). This allows modifying the generated content's attributes based on text while preserving the semantic features of the reference image subject.

2) Propose an innovative attention blending strategy during the denoising process that blends self-attention features from three streams - reconstruction, text-editing, and target image generation. This retains generated subject features while achieving text-driven capability for attribute modification.

3) Enhance the blending strategy by blending streams only during certain steps, avoiding unintended changes.


Main Contributions:

1) First tuning-free method to concurrently use text and image guidance for specific region image customization.

2) Self-attention blending strategy to address issues with unintended changes in non-target areas and enable precise editing of attributes. 

3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance in evaluations. Provides an efficient, versatile solution for practical applications like image synthesis, design, and creative photography.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative framework and strategy to achieve dual text-image guided, region-specific image customization without any tuning, overcoming limitations of prior arts. It has immense practical value and outperforms previous methods significantly.
