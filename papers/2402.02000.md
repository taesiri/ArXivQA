# [A Survey on Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey on Graph Condensation":

Problem:
- Analyzing large-scale graphs poses challenges for computational efficiency and resource requirements. 
- Graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a solution to address these challenges by reducing the scale of large graphs while preserving essential information.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a formal definition of GC: methods that aim to scale large graphs down to smaller yet informative new graphs. 
- A taxonomy is established that categorizes GC methods into:
  - Graph-guided: Preserve graph properties like spectral or spatial characteristics
  - Model-guided: Retain capabilities of models like GNNs for downstream tasks 
  - Hybrid: Combine both graph and model guidance
- Formulations to generate condensed graphs are classified into:
  - Modification: Aggregates nodes from original graph
  - Synthetic: Directly optimizes condensed graph parameters

Main Contributions:  
- Formal definition and a taxonomy of GC methods
- Analysis of formulations to generate condensed graphs
- Discussion of datasets, evaluation metrics, limitations and future directions
- The paper addresses the lack of understanding of GC through its definition, categorization of methods, evaluation scheme and identification of open challenges.
- It provides structure to the growing research area of GC and lays groundwork to advance work in this domain.

In summary, the paper comprehensively surveys graph condensation methods, provides formalization and analysis of different techniques, and outlines future directions to facilitate research in developing condensed yet informative graphs from large-scale graph data.
