# [Asynchronous Distributed Optimization with Delay-free Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06508)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies asynchronous distributed optimization algorithms for solving consensus optimization problems over networks. Specifically, it develops and analyzes asynchronous variants of two popular algorithms - Proximal Decentralized Gradient Descent (Prox-DGD) and Decentralized Gradient Descent with Adapt-Then-Combine (DGD-ATC). A key novelty is proving convergence guarantees for these algorithms under fixed step-sizes that do not depend on the delays, in contrast to prior asynchronous methods that use delay-dependent step-sizes. The asynchronous Prox-DGD and DGD-ATC algorithms are shown to converge to the fixed points of their synchronous counterparts under both total and partial asynchrony models, for strongly convex and general convex problems. Convergence rates are derived that adapt to the actual asynchrony rather than worst-case delays. The algorithms can handle non-quadratic objectives and general undirected networks, unlike prior asynchronous methods with delay-free step-sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior practical performance and faster convergence of the proposed asynchronous methods compared to alternatives. While convergence is to approximate solutions, faster practical convergence is enabled by larger, delay-independent step-sizes.
