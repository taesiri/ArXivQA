# [T-Stitch: Accelerating Sampling in Pre-Trained Diffusion Models with   Trajectory Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14167)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating high-fidelity images using diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) is computationally expensive, requiring hundreds of denoising steps with a large model. Reducing the computational cost per step or reducing the number of steps are current approaches to making sampling faster, but they still use the same model across all steps. 

Key Idea: 
The paper proposes Trajectory Stitching (T-Stitch), which uses different-sized DPMs for different steps of the denoising process to reduce overall computation cost without sacrificing image quality. This is based on two insights: (1) DPMs trained on the same data have common latent spaces and sampling trajectories. (2) Early steps generate low-frequency components (global structure), while later steps fill in high-frequency detail.

Solution:
T-Stitch first applies a smaller, faster DPM for early steps to sketch out a global structure. Then it switches to a larger DPM for later steps that specializes in adding high-frequency details. The fraction of steps taken by each DPM is a tuneable parameter that controls the speed-quality tradeoff. Experiments show up to 40% of steps can use a 10x faster small DPM like DiT-S with no performance drop, achieving 1.5x accelerations for the overall sampling.

Key Contributions:
- First technique to dynamically allocate different-sized models to diffusion sampling steps for speedups.
- Achieves up to 1.76x speedup with lossless generation quality, outperforming model compression or step reduction approaches. 
- Simple drop-in acceleration for existing pretrained models like Stable Diffusion without retraining.
- Complements orthogonal fast sampling techniques like distillation or lightweight design.
- Analysis shows global structure generation is more tractable, motivating small model design.

The paper demonstrates consistent speedup and Pareto optimality across model architectures, datasets, and sampling methods. T-Stitch accelerates Stable Diffusion sampling and improves prompt alignment in stylized models, showing practical speed-quality benefits.
