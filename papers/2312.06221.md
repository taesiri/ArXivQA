## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel optimal transport formulation called Curriculum and Structure-aware Optimal Transport (CSOT) to tackle the problem of learning with noisy labels (LNL). CSOT constructs a robust pseudo-labeling algorithm that considers both the global and local structure of the training data distribution. Specifically, it adds regularized terms to encourage assignment consistency between similar samples and progressively increases the number of samples given pseudo-labels over the course of training. This avoids error accumulation by only assigning labels to high-confidence samples early on. The method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on CIFAR and WebVision datasets across various noise ratios. A generalized conditional gradient framework with an efficient scaling iteration is proposed to solve the new nonconvex CSOT optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate CSOT's superior performance in identifying clean samples, correcting corrupted labels, and training noise-robust models. The curriculum scheme and simultaneous modeling of inter- and intra-distribution structures are the key innovations that set CSOT apart from existing LNL techniques.
