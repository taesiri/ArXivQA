# [Evaluating Impact of Social Media Posts by Executives on Stock Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.1287)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:1. RQ-1: Does social media have any influence on close price movements of stocks over a longer period of time? 2. RQ-2: Do opinions of executives on Twitter have greater influence on closing price of stocks than that of general people?3. RQ-3: Which is a more influential platform, Twitter or Reddit?The authors investigate whether sentiment expressed in social media posts, especially by executives, has an impact on the closing prices of stocks. They analyze data from Twitter and Reddit along with historical stock price data to study this question for different stocks (Apple, Tesla) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum). Their main hypotheses appear to be that social media sentiment does influence closing prices, and that posts by executives have a greater influence than posts by general people. They also compare Twitter and Reddit to see which platform is more influential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors have shown that sentiment from social media posts, especially Twitter and Reddit, have a significant influence on stock price movements. By incorporating sentiment scores from posts into time series models like LSTM and GRU, they were able to improve the accuracy of predicting closing stock prices. 2. The authors demonstrated that posts and opinions from company executives have a much greater impact on stock prices compared to regular users/general public. Across different stocks and cryptocurrencies, the models performed better when using executive sentiment rather than general sentiment.3. The authors found that the conclusions from using Twitter data also largely held when using Reddit data, though Twitter seemed more influential overall. They validated their findings across multiple companies, cryptocurrencies, and social media platforms.4. Through extensive experiments, the authors were able to conclusively show that social media opinions, especially from executives, matter for stock price prediction. They released code and datasets to facilitate reproducibility and future research.In summary, the key contribution is comprehensively showing the impact of social media sentiment, particularly executive opinions, on stock market prediction, across multiple data sources and experimental settings. The paper makes a convincing case for the power of social media opinions in finance.
