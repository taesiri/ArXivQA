# [Evaluating Impact of Social Media Posts by Executives on Stock Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.1287)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

1. RQ-1: Does social media have any influence on close price movements of stocks over a longer period of time? 

2. RQ-2: Do opinions of executives on Twitter have greater influence on closing price of stocks than that of general people?

3. RQ-3: Which is a more influential platform, Twitter or Reddit?

The authors investigate whether sentiment expressed in social media posts, especially by executives, has an impact on the closing prices of stocks. They analyze data from Twitter and Reddit along with historical stock price data to study this question for different stocks (Apple, Tesla) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum). Their main hypotheses appear to be that social media sentiment does influence closing prices, and that posts by executives have a greater influence than posts by general people. They also compare Twitter and Reddit to see which platform is more influential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors have shown that sentiment from social media posts, especially Twitter and Reddit, have a significant influence on stock price movements. By incorporating sentiment scores from posts into time series models like LSTM and GRU, they were able to improve the accuracy of predicting closing stock prices. 

2. The authors demonstrated that posts and opinions from company executives have a much greater impact on stock prices compared to regular users/general public. Across different stocks and cryptocurrencies, the models performed better when using executive sentiment rather than general sentiment.

3. The authors found that the conclusions from using Twitter data also largely held when using Reddit data, though Twitter seemed more influential overall. They validated their findings across multiple companies, cryptocurrencies, and social media platforms.

4. Through extensive experiments, the authors were able to conclusively show that social media opinions, especially from executives, matter for stock price prediction. They released code and datasets to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

In summary, the key contribution is comprehensively showing the impact of social media sentiment, particularly executive opinions, on stock market prediction, across multiple data sources and experimental settings. The paper makes a convincing case for the power of social media opinions in finance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the impact of social media posts, particularly from executives, on stock prices by analyzing sentiments from Twitter and Reddit posts and incorporating them into time series models for predicting closing prices of stocks like Apple, Tesla, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how it compares to other research in the field of predicting stock prices using social media data:

- The main novel contribution is studying the differences in impact between executive vs general social media posts on stock prices. Most prior work has looked at overall social media sentiment without differentiating between these types of users. 

- The paper builds on previous work showing correlations between overall social media sentiment and stock prices (Bollen et al. 2011, Mao et al. 2012, Sprenger et al. 2014). However, it goes further by separating executive and general posts.

- The findings align with and provide more extensive validation for previous papers showing the significant impact of executive social media posts (Jermann 2017, Elliott et al. 2018, Chen et al. 2019). This paper examines multiple companies and cryptocurrencies over long time periods.

- The paper introduces comparison between platforms (Twitter vs Reddit) for stock prediction, finding Twitter to be more impactful. This adds a new dimension compared to prior work mostly focusing just on Twitter.

- Methodologically, the usage of deep learning models like GRU and LSTM is standard practice and similar to related papers (Xu & Cohen 2018, Sawhney et al. 2022). The key differences are in the datasets used.

- Overall, the paper makes good incremental contributions on top of the existing literature by doing an in-depth differentiated analysis of executive vs general posts across platforms and stocks/cryptocurrencies. The findings on executive posts are the most novel aspect compared to prior work.

In summary, the paper provides extensive validation and insights that build nicely on the foundations established by previous research in this field. The differentiation between user types is its standout contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Instead of just using the sentiment of the tweets, use the entire textual content for predicting close prices.

- Find a better way to impute sentiment on days when no tweets or posts are available. 

- Analyze the hashtags used by executives and general people to potentially draw useful conclusions. 

- Train models on more granular data so users can leverage them to choose winning stocks by utilizing stock price predictions made every minute. 

- Build a real-time system that streams tweets and makes predictions, allowing users to select stocks of interest and follow the predictions for portfolio management.

In summary, the main future directions suggested are: using more textual content beyond just sentiment, improving sentiment imputation, analyzing hashtags, making more granular and real-time predictions, and integrating the predictions into portfolio management applications. The authors suggest various ways to build on their work to make the stock price predictions more accurate, granular, and practically useful.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the impact of social media posts by executives and general people on predicting stock prices. Using Twitter and Reddit data along with historical stock data, the authors perform experiments on multiple stocks (Apple, Tesla) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum). They find that incorporating sentiment from social media posts significantly improves stock price prediction compared to using just historical data. Further experiments show executive tweets have a greater influence than general tweets. The findings hold for both Twitter and Reddit posts, though Twitter is more influential, especially for executive posts. Overall, the paper demonstrates social media sentiment, particularly from executives, can help predict stock price movements.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper investigates the impact of social media posts, specifically from Twitter and Reddit, on predicting stock prices. The authors conducted experiments using historical stock data along with sentiment analysis of social media posts about those stocks. They looked at two companies (Apple and Tesla) as well as two cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum). 

The key findings were: 1) Incorporating sentiment from social media posts improves the accuracy of predicting stock prices compared to using just historical data. 2) Posts by executives have a greater influence on price movements than posts by general people. This held true across both Twitter and Reddit. 3) Overall, Twitter proved more useful than Reddit for predicting prices when using executive posts, but Reddit was better when using only posts by the general public. The paper makes notable contributions in rigorously validating the impact of social media opinions, especially by executives, on stock prices across multiple companies and platforms.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper investigates the impact of social media posts on the closing prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies. The authors collected tweets and Reddit posts related to Tesla, Apple, Bitcoin, and Ethereum stocks/currencies. They performed sentiment analysis on the posts using VADER and FinBERT and aligned the sentiment scores with historical stock price data. Using time series models like RNN, GRU, and LSTM, they trained models to predict closing prices based on historical data alone and historical data combined with social media sentiment. They compared the performance of models trained on general posts versus executive posts to determine which had a greater influence. The authors evaluated the models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. Their experiments consistently showed that including social media sentiment, especially from executive posts, improved closing price prediction across multiple stocks and cryptocurrencies.
