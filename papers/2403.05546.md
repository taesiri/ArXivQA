## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unified Occupancy on a Public Transport Network through Combination of AFC and APC Data":

Problem:
Public transportation operators need to understand ridership on their networks in order to properly plan service frequency, vehicle capacities, schedules etc. Traditionally they have relied on manual ride checks or passenger surveys which are expensive, have sampling biases, and do not provide complete spatio-temporal coverage. While automated data sources like Automated Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) systems are increasingly available, each has limitations - AFC does not capture fare evasion/fraud and APC systems are only deployed on a subset of vehicles. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel "unified occupancy" method to estimate actual occupancy by combining incomplete APC data with complete AFC data. The key idea is to model fare evasion rates at the station level using courses with both AFC and APC, then extend this to courses with only AFC data. This involves:
1) Reconstructing passenger trips from AFC data 
2) Computing per-station fare evasion rates by comparing AFC occupancy to APC occupancy
3) Extending these rates to the whole network via geospatial regression 
4) Applying per-station fare evasion rates to AFC-only courses to estimate complete occupancy

Main Contributions:
- Novel unified occupancy method to estimate true ridership by combining incomplete APC and complete AFC data
- Station-level fare evasion rate modeling, capturing spatial variability unlike previous approaches
- Performance evaluation on real-world data from 4 French transit networks showing improved accuracy over baselines
- Analysis of model performance under varying APC coverage rates and interpretation of resulting spatial fare evasion maps

The proposed approach helps transit operators maximize the value of available AFC and APC data to gain a complete picture of network ridership. By explicitly modeling fare evasion, it provides actionable information to combat fraud and improve revenue collection.
