# [Improving Environment Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning   Approaches for Autonomous Racing Using Bayesian Optimization-based Curriculum   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new environments outside their training distribution. This is problematic for robotics applications like autonomous driving where the agent needs to be robust to varying environments.

- Prior work has looked at using curriculum learning to improve generalization, but designing good curricula requires expertise and is labor intensive. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose using Bayesian Optimization to automatically search for a curriculum that improves policy robustness to environment variations.

- They parameterize environments using road curvature (Îº) and obstacle density (p) and define a curriculum as a sequence of changepoints specifying when to switch environment parameters during training.

- Bayesian Optimization models the mapping from curriculum to expected reward on hard environments as a Gaussian Process. It efficiently searches this space to find a robust curriculum.

Contributions:
- Demonstrate manually designed curricula improve robustness over default PPO training in a CarRacing environment with varying road curvature and obstacle density

- Show Bayesian Optimization is able to automatically find a curriculum that outperforms both the default PPO agent and hand-designed curriculum in terms of reward, collisions, and tiles visited in the hard test environments

- Analyze robustness across different environment difficulty levels and find Bayesian Optimization curriculum is most robust compared to other methods

In summary, the key idea is using Bayesian Optimization to automatically learn training curricula that improve policy robustness to environment variations for autonomous driving scenarios. The results demonstrate improved performance over default training and human-designed curricula on the CarRacing benchmark.
