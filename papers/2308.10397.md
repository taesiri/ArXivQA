# [FairBench: A Four-Stage Automatic Framework for Detecting Stereotypes   and Biases in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10397)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an automated framework to directly and comprehensively evaluate stereotypes and biases in the content generated by large language models?The key aspects related to this question include:- Developing a multi-stage framework to evaluate different manifestations of bias, from explicit to more subtle forms. The four stages aim to detect biases in a progressive manner.- Designing a benchmark focused on open-ended questions to evaluate biases in realistic educational scenarios, as opposed to constrained options. - Proposing automated evaluation methods, including multi-dimensional metrics and explainable prompts, to enable large-scale testing.- Validating the framework by applying it to detect biases in several state-of-the-art LLMs.So in summary, the paper introduces an end-to-end methodology encompassing benchmark creation, automated evaluation techniques, and empirical validation to assess biases in LLMs' generated content in a more direct, comprehensive and real-world manner. The overall goal is to advance the understanding and improvement of fairness in these models.
