# [ProCoT: Stimulating Critical Thinking and Writing of Students through   Engagement with Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have potential to enable students to cheat on writing assessments. Many educators have banned their use out of fear. 
- However, LLMs also have benefits for enhancing learning. There is a need for methods that both prevent cheating and promote critical thinking through LLM engagement.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors introduce "Probing Chain of Thought" (ProCoT). This is a method where students are asked to pose a question to an LLM, then provide peer-reviewed reference-based feedback on the LLM's response.  
- Two case studies with 66 students were conducted to evaluate ProCoT. Students used ChatGPT or Phind to generate a response to a question, then critically analyzed the response.

Key Findings:
- ProCoT prevents cheating: LLMs like ChatGPT could not provide quality peer-reviewed referenced feedback on their own responses. But students could.
- ProCoT promotes critical thinking: Comparing LLM-only to student ProCoT responses shows greater reasoning. Most students used less verbose answers than the verbose LLMs.
- Analysis methods like word counts could help detect cheating attempts. But LLMs will improve, so new methods may be needed in future.

Main Contributions:
1. ProCoT prevents LLM cheating while promoting critical thinking through LLM engagement 
2. Demonstration of ProCoT in two multi-student case studies
3. Analysis highlighting current LLM limitations that allow detection of cheating attempts
4. Discussion of need for new methods over time as LLMs continue improving

In summary, ProCoT leverages the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs to stimulate learning through engagement while preventing cheating on writing assessments. The method offers a productive path for LLM usage in education.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel method called Probing Chain-of-Thought (ProCoT) that prevents students from cheating using large language models while stimulating their critical thinking and writing skills through engagement with such models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the introduction and demonstration of a novel method called "Probing Chain-of-Thought" (ProCoT). Specifically:

1. ProCoT is presented as a method to both prevent cheating by students using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their writing, while also stimulating creative/critical thinking through engagement with such AI models. 

2. The paper demonstrates the application of ProCoT in two case studies involving university courses with around 66 students total. Students were asked to pose questions to an LLM, then provide referenced feedback on the LLM's response.

3. Analysis of the results indicates that ProCoT can prevent cheating compared to LLM-only outputs, while also improving the quality of students' writing through the need to provide referenced affirmation/refutation.

4. The paper also highlights limitations of current LLMs in providing properly referenced responses, and anticipates methods like ProCoT can help further train these AI models.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evidence for ProCoT as a novel method for preventing AI-enabled cheating while promoting critical thinking and writing skills through LLM engagement. The method is presented as a proactive way for educators to incorporate emerging AI models as pedagogical tools.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the ProCoT method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that ProCoT is based on the "Self-Regulation" learning method. Can you expand more on how the components of forethought, planning, monitoring, failure detection, and correction relate to the ProCoT process? 

2. When comparing the quality of student writing using ProCoT versus LM-only outputs, what specific criteria and statistical tests were used for the evaluation? Justify if you believe better metrics could have been utilized.

3. The 3 types of outputs analyzed were: LM-only, student ProCoT, and LM ProCoT. Discuss whether analyzing intermediate outputs between the LM-only and final student output could reveal further insights into the student's critical thinking process.  

4. When using ProCoT with future improved LMs that provide references, how can students still demonstrate original critical thinking rather than relying primarily on the LM output?

5. The paper hypothesizes new methods may be needed to prevent cheating as LMs improve. Propose and justify a modified version of ProCoT or an alternative approach to maintain effective assessments.  

6. How would a longitudinal study analyzing changes in students' writing over an entire degree program with and without ProCoT reveal useful insights? Describe an ideal study design.  

7. Feedback and reflection are argued to be vital components of writing pedagogy. Suggest how peer review or self-assessment could be integrated into the ProCoT method.

8. Discuss the dual role responsibility of students using AI tools responsibly while institutions ensure models align ethically. How can ProCoT assist progress on both fronts?  

9. The paper briefly mentions possible multimodal evaluations using interviews to prevent cheating. Expand on how AI could assist rather than replace such human assessments.  

10. Beyond writing quality itself, analyze how engaging with LMs through ProCoT could impact other ILOs related to critical thinking, research skills, etc. Suggest additional metrics to capture these outcomes.
