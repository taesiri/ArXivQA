# [ProCoT: Stimulating Critical Thinking and Writing of Students through   Engagement with Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have potential to enable students to cheat on writing assessments. Many educators have banned their use out of fear. 
- However, LLMs also have benefits for enhancing learning. There is a need for methods that both prevent cheating and promote critical thinking through LLM engagement.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors introduce "Probing Chain of Thought" (ProCoT). This is a method where students are asked to pose a question to an LLM, then provide peer-reviewed reference-based feedback on the LLM's response.  
- Two case studies with 66 students were conducted to evaluate ProCoT. Students used ChatGPT or Phind to generate a response to a question, then critically analyzed the response.

Key Findings:
- ProCoT prevents cheating: LLMs like ChatGPT could not provide quality peer-reviewed referenced feedback on their own responses. But students could.
- ProCoT promotes critical thinking: Comparing LLM-only to student ProCoT responses shows greater reasoning. Most students used less verbose answers than the verbose LLMs.
- Analysis methods like word counts could help detect cheating attempts. But LLMs will improve, so new methods may be needed in future.

Main Contributions:
1. ProCoT prevents LLM cheating while promoting critical thinking through LLM engagement 
2. Demonstration of ProCoT in two multi-student case studies
3. Analysis highlighting current LLM limitations that allow detection of cheating attempts
4. Discussion of need for new methods over time as LLMs continue improving

In summary, ProCoT leverages the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs to stimulate learning through engagement while preventing cheating on writing assessments. The method offers a productive path for LLM usage in education.
