# [Explore and Tell: Embodied Visual Captioning in 3D Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop visual captioning models that can actively navigate 3D environments to generate more accurate and comprehensive descriptions? The key hypothesis is that equipping visual captioning models with navigation capabilities will enable them to gather visual information from multiple viewpoints, which can reduce ambiguity and lead to better scene understanding and description compared to just using a single static image.To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a new task called "Embodied Captioning" where an agent starts at a random viewpoint and must navigate a 3D environment to generate a descriptive paragraph about the full scene. They also develop a dataset and model architecture designed for this task. The model combines a navigator module to explore the environment and a captioning module to leverage the navigation trajectory for generating descriptions. Experiments demonstrate their method outperforms other baselines, providing support for the hypothesis.In summary, the paper introduces Embodied Captioning as a way to improve visual captioning by enabling models to actively perceive from different viewpoints, and presents initial progress on a dataset, model architecture, and experiments for this new task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new task called Embodied Captioning, which requires an agent to actively navigate a 3D environment to gather visual information from different viewpoints and generate comprehensive paragraph descriptions. This integrates navigation abilities into visual captioning.2. Building a new dataset ET-Cap to support the Embodied Captioning task. It contains 10K synthetic 3D scenes with manual annotations of good viewpoints and paragraph descriptions. 3. Designing a Cascade Embodied Captioning model (CaBOT) which consists of a navigator to explore the environment and a captioner to generate descriptions based on the navigation trajectory.4. Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CaBOT model and show the potential benefits of joint modeling navigation and captioning for this new Embodied Captioning task.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the new Embodied Captioning task and dataset to push visual captioning models to handle imperfect viewpoints via active perception, and providing a strong baseline model CaBOT for future research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new embodied captioning task and model which equips visual captioning agents with navigation capabilities, enabling them to actively explore 3D environments from different viewpoints to generate more accurate and comprehensive descriptions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in embodied visual captioning and embodied navigation:- This paper proposes a new task called "Embodied Captioning" which requires an agent to actively navigate a 3D environment and generate descriptive paragraphs about the full scene. Most prior work has focused on simpler forms of embodied visual description like single image captioning. - The paper introduces a new dataset ET-Cap with 10K synthetic 3D scenes to support this task. Each scene has multiple human-annotated good viewpoints and descriptive paragraphs. Prior datasets for embodied navigation and visual description have been limited in scale and/or realism.- The proposed Cascade embodied captioning (CaBOT) model incorporates a navigator and captioner module. The navigator leverages history of observations and actions to explore the environment, while the captioner leverages the full trajectory for description. This is a unique approach compared to prior work.- Experiments demonstrate CaBOT outperforms various baselines on the Embodied Captioning task. The authors also analyze model generalization and show potential for joint training of the navigator and captioner.- Overall, this paper pushes embodied visual description to a more complex paragraph-level task requiring active environmental exploration. The new dataset, model, and experiments significantly advance the state-of-the-art in embodied vision-and-language research.In summary, the key novelties are the Embodied Captioning task formulation, associated dataset, and cascaded model incorporating navigation and multi-view paragraph captioning. The experiments provide promising results on this challenging task and highlight opportunities for future work.
