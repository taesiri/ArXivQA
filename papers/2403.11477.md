# [Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Weakly Communicating and   General Average Reward MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the sample complexity of learning a near-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. Prior work made strong assumptions like uniformly bounded mixing times or had suboptimal dependence on key parameters. This paper aims to resolve the sample complexity with optimal dependence on all parameters for both weakly communicating and general MDPs.

Proposed Solution and Main Contributions:

Weakly Communicating MDPs:
- The paper establishes a sample complexity of Õ(SAH/ε2) for finding an ε-optimal policy in weakly communicating MDPs, where S and A are the number of states and actions, H is the span of the optimal bias function, and Õ hides log factors. This matches the known lower bound and improves over prior work.

- The result is obtained by: (1) Reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP using a reduction from prior work. (2) Obtaining an improved analysis for the discounted MDP using a novel multi-step variance argument leading to a bound in terms of H rather than the mixing time.

- This is the first bound for average-reward MDPs that has optimal dependence on all parameters S, A, H, ε without requiring restrictive uniform mixing time assumptions.


General MDPs:
- The paper introduces a new "transient time" parameter B and shows the complexity is Õ((B+H)SA/ε2)) for general MDPs. A matching lower bound is also provided.

- A delicate reduction from average-reward to discounted MDP is developed and analyzed. Improved discounted MDP analysis is obtained by decomposing states into recurrent and transient and using novel variance arguments.

- This is the first work addressing sample complexity of average-reward MDPs beyond the weakly communicating setting. The introduced transient time parameter is shown to be necessary, and tight complexity characterizations are provided.

In summary, the paper resolves the sample complexity of average-reward MDPs under a generative model for both weakly communicating and general MDPs, with parameter-optimal bounds. The techniques circumvent known limitations for analyzing discounted MDPs and help elucidate connections between average-reward and discounted criteria.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper resolves the sample complexity of learning near-optimal policies in average reward Markov decision processes, establishing minimax optimal bounds for both weakly communicating and general MDPs in terms of key parameters capturing the effective horizon and transient behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to understanding the sample complexity of learning near-optimal policies in average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs):

1. For weakly communicating MDPs, it establishes a sample complexity of Õ(SAH/ε^2) for learning an ε-optimal policy, matching the minimax lower bound. This is the first bound with optimal dependence on all parameters S, A, H, ε. 

2. It introduces a new "transient time" parameter T for general (non-weakly-communicating) MDPs and proves a Õ(SA(T+H)/ε^2) sample complexity upper bound. This is matched by a lower bound showing the necessity of the T parameter.

3. To obtain the improved bounds, new analysis techniques are developed for reducing average-reward MDPs to discounted MDPs. Tighter variance bounds are derived for the resulting discounted problems in terms of H and T.

4. The analysis avoids common restrictive assumptions on mixing times and applies beyond strongly-communicating MDPs. The span H can be much smaller than other complexity measures like the diameter or mixing times.

In summary, the key innovation is introducing the span parameter H and transient time parameter T to more precisely characterize the sample complexity of average-reward MDPs, leading to improved algorithms and tight problem-dependent bounds. The analysis provides new insights into relating average-reward and discounted MDPs.

The paper studies the sample complexity (number of samples needed) for learning near-optimal policies in average-reward MDPs under a generative model. It provides tight bounds for both weakly communicating MDPs, in terms of the span norm of the bias function, and general MDPs, in terms of the span and a new transient time parameter. Key techniques involve reducing the average-reward problems to discounted MDPs and carefully analyzing certain variance quantities. The paper makes contributions to both weakly communicating and general average-reward MDPs, as well as to discounted MDP analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper reduces the problem of learning optimal policies for average-reward MDPs to learning near-optimal policies for discounted MDPs. What is the intuition behind why this reduction allows for improved sample complexity bounds compared to directly analyzing average-reward MDPs?

2) For weakly communicating MDPs, the reduction in Lemma 1 chooses a discount factor γ = 1 - ε/H. What would be the implications of using a larger or smaller value of γ? How does the choice of γ impact the subsequent analysis? 

3) The proof of Theorem 1 bounds certain variance terms using a multi-step variance Bellman equation. Why is it useful to expand the variance Bellman equation to H steps instead of the standard one-step expansion? How does the choice of H steps lead to the improved bound?

4) How does Theorem 1 improve upon existing sample complexity bounds for discounted MDPs? What assumptions enable circumventing the known lower bound that typically arises? 

5) For general MDPs, explain the intuition behind why the span H is insufficient to characterize complexity and why the introduced transient time parameter Tb is necessary. Provide examples illustrating this.

6) The reduction for general MDPs in Theorem 4 requires more delicate analysis than the weakly communicating setting. What are the main challenges that arise and how does the proof handle relating the gain of the optimal discounted policy back to ρ*?

7) Explain the high-level ideas behind how the analysis bounds the variance terms for general discounted MDPs. How does the handling of recurrent states differ from transient states in Lemma 7?

8) The lower bounds construct hard instances with certain properties. What aspects of these constructed MDPs make them difficult and require dependence on Tb in the sample complexity? 

9) How do the weakly communicating and general MDP bounds compare? Could the analysis for general MDPs be applied in the weakly communicating setting to recover Theorem 1? Why or why not?

10) The paper analyzes sample complexity in terms of the span H and transient time Tb. What other problem parameters could be used and how might the analysis change? What are the benefits of using H and Tb?
