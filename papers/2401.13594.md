# [Graph Guided Question Answer Generation for Procedural   Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13594)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on automatic question-answer (QA) generation from procedural text such as cooking recipes. This is challenging because it requires reasoning about temporal relations across multiple steps.  
- Existing QA generation methods either don't handle temporal relations well or rely on expensive large language models (LLMs) which lack control mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage the structured nature of procedural text by representing the overall flow and each step as graphs. Specifically, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs are used for individual steps, and action flow graphs are used to capture temporal relations.

- Perform controlled transformations on AMR graphs of each step to generate role-specific, instruction-level and polarity QA pairs related to that step.  

- Traverse action flow graph to select temporal content like ingredients of mixtures, next actions etc. and create temporal question templates. Questions are then generated using AMR graph transformations and a graph-to-text model.

- Optionally improve syntactic diversity of questions using LLMs for paraphrasing or answer-based augmentation.

Key Contributions:

- Novel graph-based method for exhaustive and high-quality QA generation from procedural text, with configurable control.

- Demonstrate strong extrinsic performance: small models trained on generated data compete with GPT3/ChatGPT, despite using much fewer parameters.

- Show importance of semantic coverage for QA training rather than just syntactic diversity. Graph method has high coverage of human questions.

- Proposed approach complements strengths of LLMs to further boost performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a graph-based method for automatically generating diverse and semantically comprehensive question-answer pairs from procedural text like recipes, which can be used to train compact yet strong question answering models for task-specific applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract, the main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It tackles the problem of task-specific question answering (QA) from procedural text and shows that small models can compete with very large language models like ChatGPT and GPT3 when provided with high-quality and exhaustive training data.

2. It introduces a novel graph-based method for automatically generating high-quality and exhaustive question-answer pairs from procedural text, which can then be used to train task-specific QA models. This method leverages graph representations like Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs) and flow graphs.

3. It empirically shows that QA models trained on the automatically generated data achieve excellent performance on the target QA task, even exceeding GPT3 and ChatGPT on some metrics, despite being orders of magnitude smaller. It also shows the importance of semantic coverage over syntactic diversity for good downstream QA performance.

In summary, the main contribution is a new graph-based method for generating high-quality procedural QA data that can be used to train very compact but high-performing task-specific QA models.

It leverages semantic graph representations like AMRs and action flow graphs to exhaustively generate question-answer pairs from procedural text in a controllable manner. The paper also shows that combining this graph-based approach with large language models can further improve syntactic diversity. Evaluations demonstrate the coverage and quality of the generated data, and how it can be used to train compact yet high-performing QA models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the graph-guided question answering method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions representing procedural text semantics using both AMR and flow graphs. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of using each representation? When is one more suitable than the other?

2. When generating questions about ARG1 using the proposed method, the paper describes a process of splitting compounds and gradually transforming the AMR. What is the purpose of splitting compounds in this manner instead of asking about the full compound directly? 

3. For temporal question generation, both AMR and flow graphs are utilized in a hybrid approach. What is the rationale behind using AMR for the question templates rather than directly modifying the flow graphs themselves?

4. The method incorporates GPT-3 in two ways - for answer-based augmentation and paraphrasing questions. What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches? Which one results in higher quality and diversity of questions?

5. The intrinsic evaluations assess diversity, coverage and overall quality of the generated questions. Which of these metrics correlates most strongly with downstream QA performance? 

6. For training the graph-to-question generator, SQuAD and R2VQ datasets are used. What types of questions do these datasets contain and what impact does this have on the generator's ability to produce certain procedural question types?

7. When evaluating on the human PQA test set, the method outperforms baselines like GPT-3 despite using a much smaller model. What explanations are provided for why specialized, high-quality data enables smaller models to compete with large pre-trained ones?

8. What temporal question types does the method currently handle and what other important temporal question types remain unaddressed? How feasible would it be to extend the approach to cover additional temporal relations?

9. The paper focuses specifically on procedural text in the cooking domain. What challenges would adapting the approach to other procedural domains like science, manufacturing, etc. entail? 

10. For real-world deployment, what mechanisms could be incorporated to ensure the quality and correctness of automatically generated QA pairs using this method? How can the coverage and diversity continue to improve over time?
