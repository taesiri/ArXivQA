# [Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification   along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models are vulnerable to multimodal adversarial attacks. However, existing attack methods tend to overfit to the victim model, limiting transferability of attacks across models. 

- The state-of-the-art method, Set-Level Guidance Attack (SGA), focuses on diversity around online adversarial examples during optimization. This risks overfitting the victim model as examples are generated by the model itself.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose diversifying along the "intersection region" of clean image, previous adversarial image, and current adversarial image. This expands diversity towards both clean images and adversarial images, mitigating overfitting.

- Introduce "text-guided adversarial example selection" to select the sample that maximally distances the adversarial image from the paired text. 

- Deviate adversarial text from the last intersection region instead of just the final adversarial image. This further reduces overfitting to the victim model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel concept of "intersection region of adversarial trajectory" to expand diversity of examples during attack optimization and reduce overfitting.

- Text-guided selection approach to leverage modality interactions for optimal adversarial example selection.

- Deviating adversarial text from intersection region rather than just final adversarial image, enhancing transferability.

- Experiments show substantially improved cross-model and cross-task transferability over state-of-the-art attacks on major VLP models and across image-text retrieval, visual grounding and image captioning.
