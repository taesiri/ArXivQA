# [Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10656)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse Problems. The main idea is to use diffusion models to jointly estimate both the latent image and the unknown forward operator in blind inverse problems where the forward model is not known a priori. 

The key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- Can diffusion models be used as effective priors to jointly estimate both the latent image and unknown forward operator parameters in blind inverse problems?

- Can running parallel diffusion models on the image and operator spaces enable stable joint optimization in a coarse-to-fine manner? 

- Will using diffusion models as priors outperform conventional priors like sparsity or heuristics for parameter and image estimation in blind problems?

- Can the proposed approach achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on representative blind inverse problems like blind deblurring and imaging through turbulence?

The central hypothesis is that by using diffusion models to implicitly capture priors on both the image and operator spaces, the proposed Parallel Diffusion Models approach can effectively solve blind inverse problems in a more robust and generalizable manner compared to existing methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through theoretical analysis and strong experimental results on tasks like blind deconvolution and turbulence imaging.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called BlindDPS (Blind Diffusion Posterior Sampling) for solving blind inverse problems using diffusion models. The key ideas are:

- Constructing parallel diffusion models for both the latent image and the unknown forward operator parameters (e.g. kernel, tilt map). This allows jointly optimizing both components to estimate the latent image and operator. 

- Using the denoised estimates from the diffusion models to compute the residual and update the parameters. This enables end-to-end joint optimization in a stable way.

- Theoretically showing that the proposed approximation leads to posterior sampling from the true posterior distribution.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on two tasks - blind deconvolution and imaging through turbulence. The method is flexible and applicable to different blind inverse problems.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to leverage diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems by constructing parallel diffusion processes and using the denoised estimates for joint optimization. This enables modeling strong priors on both the image and operator for accurate reconstruction. The effectiveness is shown through extensive experiments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called BlindDPS that uses parallel diffusion models to jointly optimize the reconstruction of an image and the estimation of an unknown degradation operator or parameters for blind inverse problems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper on parallel diffusion models for blind inverse problems compares to other related work:

- This paper proposes a novel approach to solving blind inverse problems using diffusion models, which has not been explored before. Most prior work on using diffusion models for inverse problems assumes the forward model/operator is known (non-blind setting). This paper shows diffusion models can be adapted to jointly estimate both the latent image and forward operator parameters.

- For blind deblurring, this paper outperforms prior optimization methods like Pan et al. that use handcrafted priors (sparsity, dark channel, etc). It also improves over deep learning methods like SelfDeblur that use implicit learned priors. The key difference is the paper uses explicit diffusion priors on both the image and kernel. 

- For imaging through turbulence, most prior learning-based methods train supervised models on simulated data. This paper takes an unsupervised approach leveraging diffusion generative priors. It shows competitive or superior results to supervised methods.

- The proposed parallel diffusion framework is flexible and generalizable to different blind inverse problems, as demonstrated on deblurring and turbulence. It is applicable when the functional form of the forward model is known.

- A limitation compared to amortized inference networks is the need to train/run specialized score networks for each component of the model. So efficiency may be lower than supervised methods.

- Overall, the paper makes a novel contribution in adapting diffusion models to blind problems and shows state-of-the-art results. The parallel modeling framework and theoretical analysis are significant advances to the inverse problems literature.

In summary, this paper pushes diffusion model-based approaches to a new problem domain of blind image reconstruction and offers improved performance compared to optimization and learning methods. The parallel modeling framework could inspire more unsupervised methods for inverse imaging problems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Applying the method to truly blind cases where the functional form of the forward model is unknown. The current method requires knowing the structure of the forward model (e.g. convolution) in advance. Developing methods that can handle completely unknown forward models would further increase the applicability.

- Scaling the method to more complex forward models with multiple parameters. Currently, the number of score functions required scales linearly with the number of parameters, which leads to slower inference. Finding ways to make the inference more efficient would be an important direction. 

- Making the optimization process more robust and stable. Although the proposed method works well in many cases, the joint optimization can sometimes diverge if the parameters are not tuned properly. Improving the stability and making the method more plug-and-play would be desirable.

- Applying the framework to broader tasks beyond imaging, such as audio, video, medical imaging, etc. The general framework of using diffusion priors and posterior sampling has the potential to work for various inverse problems beyond the imaging tasks demonstrated in this paper.

- Exploring conditional diffusion models to inject conditional information into the priors. This could allow creating task-specific diffusion priors that can further improve results.

- Combining the proposed framework with other existing methods, such as optimization and deep learning approaches, to get the benefits of both worlds.

In summary, the main future directions are 1) expanding the applicability to more general blind inverse problems, 2) improving efficiency and stability, and 3) applying the method to diverse tasks beyond the domains considered in this paper. Advancing these aspects would help make diffusion-based blind inverse problem solving more practical and widely usable.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse Problems (BlindDPS) to solve blind inverse problems using diffusion models. Diffusion models have shown strong performance for non-blind inverse problems where the forward operator is known, but their applicability to blind inverse problems is unexplored. The key idea is to construct parallel diffusion priors - one for the latent image and one for the unknown forward operator parameters. This enables joint optimization of both during posterior sampling from the diffusion models. 

The method is demonstrated on two representative blind inverse problems - blind deblurring and imaging through turbulence. For blind deblurring, a diffusion prior is constructed for both the latent sharp image and the unknown blur kernel. These are optimized in parallel using gradients from the intermediate denoised estimates to minimize the residual between measurement and estimated blurry image. A similar strategy is used for turbulence, constructing priors for image, kernel and phase distortion. Experiments show the method yields state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being widely applicable to general blind inverse problems. The parallel reverse diffusion enables joint estimation in a stable way, naturally admitting a Gaussian scale-space for coarse-to-fine inference.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method called Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse Problems. The key idea is to use diffusion models to jointly optimize both the image and the forward operator parameters for blind inverse problems where the forward operator is unknown. 

Specifically, the method trains separate diffusion models and score functions for the image and the operator parameters. It then runs parallel reverse diffusions for the image and operator, using the gradients from the intermediate denoised estimates to guide the diffusion. The gradients come from computing the residual between the measurement and the output of the estimated denoised operator applied to the estimated denoised image. This allows joint optimization of both the operator parameters and image to reconstruct the solution for blind inverse problems.

The method is applied to blind deblurring, where it trains diffusion models for the image and blur kernel. It also handles imaging through turbulence by training models for the image, blur kernel and tilt map. Experiments on both tasks show the approach can effectively solve these blind inverse problems and outperforms existing methods. A key advantage is the flexibility to handle different blind inverse problems when the functional form is known.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes BlindDPS, a new method for solving blind inverse problems by leveraging diffusion models. Blind inverse problems aim to jointly reconstruct the latent image and estimate the unknown measurement operator parameters from the corrupted observation. The key idea is to construct parallel diffusion model priors - one for the image, another for the operator parameter(s). During sampling, gradients from the intermediate denoised estimates guide the reverse diffusion to optimize the joint posterior. Specifically, for blind deblurring, a diffusion prior is built for both the image and blur kernel using score matching. The kernel reconstruction is further stabilized with sparsity regularization. For imaging through turbulence, priors are constructed for the image, blur kernel and tilt map. Experiments on blind deblurring and turbulence show BlindDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance. The diffusion prior based estimation outperforms conventional model priors. The method also benefits from the inherent coarse-to-fine property of reverse diffusion, avoiding delicate parameter tuning. Overall, BlindDPS demonstrates diffusion models' potential as powerful priors for blind inverse problems.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes BlindDPS, a method for solving blind inverse problems by jointly estimating the parameters of an unknown forward measurement operator and the latent image using diffusion models. The key idea is to construct parallel reverse diffusion processes to model priors for both the image and operator parameters, allowing simultaneous posterior sampling. For example, in blind deconvolution, they train score functions to model the image distribution and blur kernel distribution separately. The cross-talk between the diffusion paths is enforced using the residual between the measurement and the reconstruction from the denoised estimates of image and kernel. This enables joint optimization to recover both components. They show results on blind deblurring and imaging through turbulence, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance by accurately estimating both the image and kernel/parameters. The method is flexible and generalizable to different blind inverse problems where the functional form is known.
