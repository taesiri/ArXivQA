# [Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10656)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new method called Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse Problems. The main idea is to use diffusion models to jointly estimate both the latent image and the unknown forward operator in blind inverse problems where the forward model is not known a priori. The key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:- Can diffusion models be used as effective priors to jointly estimate both the latent image and unknown forward operator parameters in blind inverse problems?- Can running parallel diffusion models on the image and operator spaces enable stable joint optimization in a coarse-to-fine manner? - Will using diffusion models as priors outperform conventional priors like sparsity or heuristics for parameter and image estimation in blind problems?- Can the proposed approach achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on representative blind inverse problems like blind deblurring and imaging through turbulence?The central hypothesis is that by using diffusion models to implicitly capture priors on both the image and operator spaces, the proposed Parallel Diffusion Models approach can effectively solve blind inverse problems in a more robust and generalizable manner compared to existing methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through theoretical analysis and strong experimental results on tasks like blind deconvolution and turbulence imaging.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called BlindDPS (Blind Diffusion Posterior Sampling) for solving blind inverse problems using diffusion models. The key ideas are:- Constructing parallel diffusion models for both the latent image and the unknown forward operator parameters (e.g. kernel, tilt map). This allows jointly optimizing both components to estimate the latent image and operator. - Using the denoised estimates from the diffusion models to compute the residual and update the parameters. This enables end-to-end joint optimization in a stable way.- Theoretically showing that the proposed approximation leads to posterior sampling from the true posterior distribution.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on two tasks - blind deconvolution and imaging through turbulence. The method is flexible and applicable to different blind inverse problems.In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to leverage diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems by constructing parallel diffusion processes and using the denoised estimates for joint optimization. This enables modeling strong priors on both the image and operator for accurate reconstruction. The effectiveness is shown through extensive experiments.
