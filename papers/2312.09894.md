## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "PathoDuet: Foundation Models for Pathological Slide Analysis of H&E and IHC Stains":

Problem:
- Histopathological diagnosis relies on visual examination of slides stained with H&E and IHC, which requires expertise. Generating annotations for developing AI methods is resource intensive. 
- Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for computer vision need customization for histopathology images due to gap between natural and pathological images.
- There is a need for pathological foundation models covering both H&E and IHC images to enable transfer learning for various downstream tasks with limited labeled data.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce PathoDuet, a series of foundation models on H&E and IHC pathological images.
- Propose SSL framework with pretext token that interacts with image embeddings and task raiser modules to explicitly relate different inputs.
- Design two pretext tasks:
   1) Cross-scale positioning: Relate local and global views of H&E patches using region network and patch network with pretext token. Enhances model understanding.
   2) Cross-stain transferring: Transfer H&E model to IHC using adaptive instance normalization with IHC pretext token. Injects structural knowledge from H&E.
- Evaluate on downstream tasks: CRC subtyping, WSI classification (H&E), IHC marker expression, tumor identification (IHC).

Main Contributions:
- First work to provide both H&E and IHC foundation models for pathology.
- Introduce pretext token and task raiser based SSL framework to handle multiple inputs.
- Propose cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring as pretext tasks tailored for pathology images.
- Demonstrate superiority over most downstream tasks compared to other models.
- Investigate data requirements and comparison with giant pathological models.

In summary, the paper presents PathoDuet to provide H&E and IHC foundation models for computational pathology by designing customized pretext tasks and SSL framework. Performance gains are shown on various downstream tasks.
