# [TrajectoryNAS: A Neural Architecture Search for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles using 3D point cloud data is critical but also complex and computationally expensive. 
- Existing methods suffer from slow and inaccurate predictions. They rely on hand-designed architectures that are suboptimal.
- There is a need for an automated way to design specialized neural network architectures for efficient and accurate trajectory prediction.

Proposed Solution - TrajectoryNAS:
- Implements neural architecture search to automate designing detection and prediction network architectures tailored for trajectory forecasting tasks.
- Uses a novel multi-objective energy function to optimize for accuracy (mAP, ADE, FDE metrics) and efficiency (latency).
- Employs a two-step training strategy, first on a mini dataset to speed up architecture search, then training the final model on the full dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Pioneering work to apply neural architecture search for joint detection, tracking and prediction in an end-to-end manner specifically for autonomous driving applications.
- Introduces an efficient two-step training process to make architecture search tractable on large datasets.
- Defines a new multi-objective energy function that considers diverse accuracy and efficiency objectives relevant to trajectory forecasting.

Results:
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NuScenes dataset, achieving at least 4.8% higher accuracy and 1.1x lower latency.
- Demonstrates ability to automate designing specialized architectures for trajectory prediction that surpass hand-engineered models.

In summary, TrajectoryNAS pushes state-of-the-art in trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving by leveraging neural architecture search to automatically design high-accuracy and low-latency models tailored for this task.
