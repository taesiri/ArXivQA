## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles using 3D point cloud data is critical but also complex and computationally expensive. 
- Existing methods suffer from slow and inaccurate predictions. They rely on hand-designed architectures that are suboptimal.

- Uses a novel multi-objective energy function to optimize for accuracy (mAP, ADE, FDE metrics) and efficiency (latency).
- Employs a two-step training strategy, first on a mini dataset to speed up architecture search, then training the final model on the full dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Pioneering work to apply neural architecture search for joint detection, tracking and prediction in an end-to-end manner specifically for autonomous driving applications.
- Introduces an efficient two-step training process to make architecture search tractable on large datasets.
- Defines a new multi-objective energy function that considers diverse accuracy and efficiency objectives relevant to trajectory forecasting.

Results:
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NuScenes dataset, achieving at least 4.8% higher accuracy and 1.1x lower latency.
