# [Drag View: Generalizable Novel View Synthesis with Unposed Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03704)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we perform generalizable novel view synthesis from a sparse set of unposed images? In other words, the paper is tackling the problem of generating new views of scenes using only a sparse collection of images with unknown camera poses. This is a very challenging task because without knowing the camera poses, it is difficult to establish correspondence between views or reason about scene geometry. The key hypothesis of the paper seems to be that by allowing user interaction to specify an initial target view, establishing a local coordinate system, and using transformers to aggregate features across views in a pose-invariant way, they can achieve high quality novel view synthesis on unseen scenes with only unposed images.Specifically, their proposed DragView framework addresses this problem through:- Allowing users to interactively specify an initial target view by "dragging" a source view. This avoids needing to estimate poses.- Projecting features from the target view into the source view coordinates to initialize them. - Using view-conditioned modulation layers to handle occlusion issues in the projections.- Employing an "OmniView Transformer" to aggregate features from all source views to target coordinates, without needing poses. - Finally decoding ray features into pixel colors with another transformer.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining user interaction, established relative coordinates, learned cross-view aggregation, and transformers, high quality novel views can be synthesized from unposed images alone. The experiments then aim to validate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:- It introduces a new framework called DragView for generalizable novel view synthesis from a sparse set of unposed images. This eliminates the need for pose annotations or per-scene optimization. - It allows users to interactively specify the target view to render by "dragging" a starting view through a local relative coordinate system.- It projects pixel-aligned 3D point features from the target view onto the starting view to initialize features. It uses view-dependent modulation layers to handle occlusion issues during projection.- It broadens epipolar attention to encompass all source pixels with an OmniView Transformer, facilitating aggregation of initialized coordinate-aligned point features from other unposed views. - It employs another transformer to decode ray features into final pixel intensities.- Experiments show DragView outperforms recent pose-free methods like PixelNeRF and SRT on generating photorealistic novel views of complex scenes. It also shows superior robustness to noisy poses compared to generalizable NeRF methods.In summary, the key contribution is a new interactive framework for high quality novel view synthesis that does not rely on pose estimation or per-scene optimization, enabled by coordinate projections, modulation layers, omnidirectional attention, and transformer decoding.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes DragView, a novel framework for generating photorealistic novel views from unposed images through user interaction - users drag a starting view to specify the target view, features are initialized by projection and enriched with cross-view attention, and intensities are decoded with a transformer, enabling high-quality rendering without relying on pose estimation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in novel view synthesis:- This paper tackles the problem of pose-free view synthesis, which eliminates the need for camera poses during rendering. This sets it apart from many other novel view synthesis methods like NeRF and its variants that require calibrated camera poses. Other pose-free approaches like PixelNeRF use a single input view, whereas this paper uses multiple unposed views.- The proposed DragView method renders novel views interactively based on user input specifying the target view relative to a starting view. This interactive rendering approach is quite unique compared to most neural rendering techniques. It provides more user control over viewpoint selection.- The paper demonstrates that DragView generalizes to novel scenes better than other pose-free methods like PixelNeRF and unposed scene representation methods like SRT. So it pushes the state-of-the-art in terms of view synthesis quality without poses.- The coordinate-aligned point feature initialization via projection and the OmniView Transformer for aggregating features across unposed views are novel components for pose-free view synthesis. The modulation layers are also important for handling occlusions.- Compared to generalizable NeRF methods that use posed images, DragView is shown to be much more robust to noise and errors in the camera poses. So it has a clear advantage when pose estimation is challenging or unreliable.- A limitation compared to NeRF-based approaches is that DragView relies more heavily on the starting view and may struggle with views that have large unseen regions relative to the starting view. But the overall results demonstrate clear improvements over other pose-free view synthesis techniques.In summary, the paper pushes forward pose-free novel view synthesis using ideas like interactive view selection, coordinate projections, cross-view feature aggregation, and modulation layers. The evaluations highlight advantages over existing pose-free and posed generalizable rendering methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the ability to generalize to novel views with significant unseen/occluded regions compared to the starting view. The authors note limitations when the target view contains large unseen areas, since the projected point features become less accurate. They suggest possibly updating the starting view during rendering by incorporating generated views, to improve feature initialization. - Exploring alternate interactive interfaces beyond just dragging a starting view, such as direct view specification or multiple starting views. The authors propose the current dragging interface as one intuitive way for users to specify novel views, but other interactive interfaces could be explored.- Applying the approach to video view synthesis and free-viewpoint video applications. The authors demonstrate results on single image rendering, but suggest their method could be extended to video frames.- Extending the approach to incorporate neural radiance fields to model view-dependent effects. The current method does not model view-dependent lighting effects. Combining with neural radiance fields could allow for more photorealistic rendering.- Improving run-time efficiency and memory usage, to scale to higher resolutions and more complex scenes. The current method has limitations in runtime and memory that could be addressed.- Investigating the incorporation of geometric priors to further regularize novel view synthesis. The authors note the current approach does not leverage explicit geometry, which could help in some cases.- Studying the impact of different source view selection strategies. The paper uses a pretrained view selection network, but other selection approaches could be analyzed.In summary, the main directions are: improving generalization to unseen views, exploring alternative interfaces, extending to video/radiance fields, improving efficiency, adding geometry, and analyzing view selection impact. The authors lay out a promising research roadmap building on their interactive pose-free novel view synthesis technique.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces DragView, a novel framework for generating novel views of unseen scenes from unposed imagery. The approach allows users to initialize a new view by dragging a single source image through a local relative coordinate system. Pixel-aligned features are obtained by projecting sampled 3D points from the target view onto the source view. A view-dependent modulation layer is used to handle occlusion during projection. An epipolar attention mechanism is broadened to encompass all source pixels to facilitate aggregating initialized coordinate-aligned point features from other unposed views. A transformer decodes ray features into final pixel intensities. The framework does not rely on 2D priors or explicit camera pose estimation. Experiments show DragView can generalize to new scenes using only unposed images, producing realistic novel views along flexible trajectories, outperforming recent pose-free scene representation networks. It also shows superior robustness to camera pose noise compared to generalizable NeRFs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes DragView, a novel framework for generating new views of unseen scenes from unposed images. The key idea is to allow users to interactively “drag” a starting view to specify the target view for rendering. Pixel-aligned 3D point features are initialized by projecting points sampled along the target ray onto the starting view. To handle occlusion, a view-dependent modulation layer leverages global context from the starting view to transform the point features. An OmniView Transformer is used to aggregate features from other unposed source views to enrich the coordinate-aligned point features. Finally, a ray-based transformer decodes the point features into pixel intensities. At test time, users simply select a starting view and drag it to indicate the target view, allowing novel views to be rendered in one feedforward pass without needing poses. Experiments show DragView outperforms recent pose-free methods like PixelNeRF and transformer-based approaches. It also demonstrates superior robustness to pose noise compared to generalizable NeRF methods. Limitations include decreasing quality for target views with large unseen regions. Key advantages are the intuitive interactive UI and state-of-the-art rendering on complex scenes without relying on poses.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces DragView, a novel framework for generating novel views of unseen scenes from unposed multi-view images in a feed-forward pass. The key idea is to allow users to interactively "drag" a starting view to specify the target view for rendering using a local relative coordinate system. Pixel-aligned 3D point features are initialized by projecting from the target view onto the starting view. To handle occlusion, a view-dependent modulation layer is used to complete missing regions. An OmniView Transformer is proposed to aggregate features from unposed source views to the target 3D points. This avoids needing to compute epipolar geometry like prior work. Finally, a transformer decodes the ray features into pixel colors. A view selector identifies the most relevant subset of source views to use based on global feature similarity. The whole framework is trained end-to-end without any per-scene optimization or ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality compared to recent pose-free and pose-based generalizable novel view synthesis techniques.
