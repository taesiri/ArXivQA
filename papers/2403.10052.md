# [T4P: Test-Time Training of Trajectory Prediction via Masked Autoencoder   and Actor-specific Token Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction models suffer from unreliable predictions under distribution shifts at test time due to factors like scene changes and driving habits. 
- Existing online learning methods update only the last layer of the decoder using regression loss from delayed ground truth, which risks deteriorating the model's learned representation with limited samples.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a test-time training (T4P) method with two key aspects:
   1) Masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to learn deep feature representations by incorporating reconstruction loss, preventing damage to representations when updating deeper layers.
   2) Actor-specific token memory that utilizes the sequential nature of driving data to learn actor-wise motion characteristics.

- The method has 3 phases:
   1) Offline training on source data
   2) Test-time training on target data using both regression and reconstruction losses to update layers deeper than the decoder. Actor-specific tokens are updated to capture instance motion patterns.
   3) Online evaluation using updated model and actor tokens

Main Contributions:
- Employ MAE objective for representation learning to enable updating deeper layers during test-time training
- Introduce actor-specific token memory to leverage sequential nature of data and learn instance-wise motion characteristics 
- Achieves SOTA performance across 4 datasets and various temporal configurations in accuracy and efficiency
- Enables adjustment between accuracy and efficiency by changing test-time update frequency
- Demonstrates practicality for real-world application by maintaining 10 FPS even at maximum update frequency

In summary, the paper proposes an effective and efficient test-time training approach for trajectory prediction that learns representations via MAE and actor motion patterns using instance tokens. This boosts adaptation performance across entire network layers in shifted distributions.
