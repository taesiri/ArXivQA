# [Evaluating GPT-4's Vision Capabilities on Brazilian University Admission   Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14169)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a framework to evaluate language models on entrance exams that incorporate both textual and visual elements. The authors use the two most recent editions of Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (ENEM), Brazil's main standardized exam for university admissions, as a challenging multidisciplinary benchmark. They assess the performance of textual language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as the multimodal GPT-4 with vision. Across experiments conducted with and without images/captions, the models showcase strong capabilities in step-by-step reasoning for solving complex real-world exam questions. However, mathematics questions remain challenging. The results also suggest text captions currently outperform images for the vision model, indicating room for improvement in visual encoding. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of language models to significantly contribute to educational assessments and learning. It sets the stage for future work on difficulty prediction, test item generation, and student exam preparation tools.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the performance of GPT-4 and other language models on solving multiple-choice questions from recent Brazilian college entrance exams (ENEM 2022 and 2023), incorporating image understanding and assessing both multimodal and text-only models across diverse subject areas.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a comprehensive framework to evaluate language models on entrance exams, which incorporates both textual and visual elements. Specifically, the paper evaluates the capabilities of state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 on the Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (ENEM) exam, which is a standardized test used for admission to universities in Brazil. 

The key aspects of the contribution are:

- Evaluating language models on a more realistic test setting that requires integrating textual and visual comprehension, going beyond just text-based questions. This involves using images directly in the questions or textual captions describing the images.

- Assessing performance on a Portuguese exam (ENEM), helping address the lack of multimodal benchmarks in Portuguese.

- Providing the first rigorous evaluation of multimodal language models on entrance exams in Portuguese, using the two most recent editions of ENEM (2022 and 2023).

- Showing that language models can solve complex, multidisciplinary exam questions when provided the full context including visual elements, though mathematics questions remain a particular challenge.

- Finding that textual captions describing images actually outperform directly embedding images for the vision models, indicating room for improvement in visual encoding.

In summary, the key contribution is pioneering a comprehensive, multimodal evaluation framework and benchmark for assessing language models on a realistic Portuguese entrance exam.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces comprehensive datasets for the ENEM exams that include textual descriptions of images and complex equations. What was the motivation behind creating these more complete datasets compared to prior works? What new analyses does it enable?

2. The study employs both multimodal and text-only language models. What are the key differences in capabilities between these models? What specific benefits and limitations exist in evaluating each type? 

3. The paper finds higher performance when using image captions compared to directly embedding images for the multimodal GPT-4V model. What factors may explain this result? How could the vision encoding be improved?

4. Chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations are utilized in the few-shot prompts. In what ways do you think CoT enhances model performance compared to standard few-shot learning? What are the limitations?

5. What types of reasoning (e.g. mathematical, logical, contextual) prove most challenging for the models evaluated? What targeted improvements could be made to address these weaknesses? 

6. The models exhibit a substantial gap in performance between the ENEM 2022 and ENEM 2023 exams. What hypotheses are proposed in the paper to explain this discrepancy? How would you test these hypotheses?

7. What are the key multidisciplinary knowledge areas covered in the ENEM exams? Which of those areas pose greater difficulty for language models and why? 

8. How suitable do you believe the ENEM exams are for evaluating language models compared to other standardized tests? What unique attributes make the ENEM valuable? What other exams complement it?

9. The paper analyzes only multiple choice questions. How would you extend the benchmark to include free response questions? What evaluation measures and analyses would need to be adapted?

10. What real-world applications might these multimodal models provide for the education domain? Can these methods amplify or even replace certain functionalities of human teachers? What ethical concerns exist?
