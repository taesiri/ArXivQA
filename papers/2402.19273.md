# [PlanGPT: Enhancing Urban Planning with Tailored Language Model and   Efficient Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- General purpose language models often struggle to meet the specific needs of urban planners for tasks like generating planning texts, information retrieval, and evaluating proposals. Challenges include:
  - Government document style with fixed phrases and low signal-to-noise ratio
  - Need for interdisciplinary knowledge across areas like law and environment science
  - Requirements for timeliness and handling multimodal information

Proposed Solution - PlanGPT:
- Customized local database retrieval framework using PlanEmb embedding model and PlanHS hierarchical search to improve accuracy of information extraction
- Domain-specific fine-tuning of base models in two stages - urban planning knowledge activation using self-annotation, and tailored capability development for key tasks
- PlanAgent tool with auto todo list generation, web search, invocation of specialized models, and information integration abilities

Main Contributions:
- First large language model specifically tailored for the urban and spatial planning domain
- Innovative retrieval and instruction labeling methods designed for the unique aspects of urban planning texts
- Experimental results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in urban planning tasks like text generation, style transfer, information extraction and document evaluation
- Addresses key challenges of government document style, need for interdisciplinary knowledge, and handling multimodal information in urban planning
- Developed collaboratively with institutions like Chinese Academy of Urban Planning to meet practical needs of urban professionals

The proposed PlanGPT framework with its customized components significantly enhances efficiency and quality for urban planners across typical workflows, showcasing the potential of specialized large language models in this domain.
