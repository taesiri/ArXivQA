# [Stochastic optimization with arbitrary recurrent data sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies stochastic optimization problems of the form:
$\min_\param f(\param) := \mathbb{E}_{v \sim \pi}[f^v(\param)]$
where the expectation is over a finite dataset $\mathcal{V}$ with distribution $\pi$. The goal is to develop an algorithm that can find approximate first-order stationary points of $f$ by only having access to samples $v_n$ from $\mathcal{V}$, without needing to evaluate $f$ directly. Most existing methods require strong assumptions on the sampling scheme (e.g. iid, Markovian) to guarantee convergence. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an extension of the Minimization by Incremental Surrogate Optimization (MISO) algorithm that uses either proximal regularization or a diminishing radius restriction. The key idea is to maintain and recursively update a surrogate function $g_n^v$ for each data point $v$, and optimize their average $\bar{g}_n$. Convergence guarantees are proved under the mild assumption that the sampling scheme is recurrent, meaning every data point is revisited infinitely often in expectation.

Main Contributions:
- Develops the Regularized MISO (RMISO) algorithm that provably finds approximate stationary points under arbitrary recurrent sampling schemes. Previous convergence results typically require iid or Markovian assumptions.

- Provides explicit convergence rates for RMISO in terms of the expected time between revisiting data points. Faster rates are achieved by sampling schemes that recurrently cover the data more effectively.

- Shows that proximal regularization enables a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ while diminishing radius gives asymptotic almost sure convergence to stationary points. Experiments validate improvements over baselines.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled stochastic optimization algorithm together with supporting theory that relies only on recurrence of the sampling process, significantly expanding the applicability of such methods. Explicit dependence of the rates on the speed of recurrence provides useful insights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops stochastic optimization algorithms called Regularized Minimization by Incremental Surrogate Optimization (RMISO) which achieve an optimal rate of convergence to first-order stationarity under general recurrent data sampling schemes, with the rate explicitly depending on the speed of recurrence as measured by expected return times.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) The authors propose extensions of the Minimization by Incremental Surrogate Optimization (MISO) algorithm, called Regularized MISO (RMISO), for stochastic optimization of non-convex objectives using general recurrent data sampling schemes. 

2) They show that for their proposed algorithms, recurrence of the sampling scheme is sufficient to guarantee convergence to first-order stationary points at an optimal rate of O(1/sqrt(n)), matching the rates for methods like SAG and SVRG that assume stronger sampling assumptions like independence or Markovian sampling.

3) The convergence rates explicitly depend on the speed of recurrence through quantities like the target time and hitting time, suggesting faster algorithms can be obtained by selecting sampling schemes that cover the data more effectively.

4) They provide applications of their framework in areas like distributed optimization and non-negative matrix factorization. Experimental results validate the robustness and faster convergence of their methods compared to baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is developing extensions of MISO applicable to non-convex optimization with recurrent sampling that enjoy optimal convergence rates and experimental performance while having minimal assumptions on the sampling process.

The paper develops RMISO algorithms for stochastic optimization of non-convex functions using general recurrent data sampling schemes. Key contributions include establishing convergence rates for RMISO under different regularization strategies, relating the rates explicitly to data recurrence properties measured by target time and hitting time, and demonstrating improved optimization performance both theoretically and empirically by selecting sampling algorithms that cover the data more effectively. Applications in decentralized optimization and nonnegative matrix factorization are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the use of regularization help enable convergence guarantees under general recurrent sampling schemes? Does it provide a form of iterate stability? 

2. Why can't similar convergence results be obtained for SGD under recurrent sampling? Is the additional storage requirement crucial?

3. This paper shows a convergence rate of $O(n^{-1/2})$ which matches variance reduced methods like SAG. Does the analysis rely on similar techniques? How does it differ?

4. Can you explain the intuition behind relating the error $\|\nabla \bar{h}_n(\param_n)\|$ to the sequence of parameter differences through the key lemma? 

5. How exactly does the dynamic proximal regularization parameter $\rho_n$ adapt to the sampling process? What role does it play in the $L^1$ convergence result?

6. The diminishing radius method seems to have the strongest convergence guarantees. Why can't similar results be shown for the constant proximal regularization case? 

7. How does the analysis handle the fact that the averaged surrogate $\bar{g}_n$ may not be directly minimized at each step due to the regularization?  

8. This method requires additional storage scaling with the number of data points. Are there ways this storage could be reduced while preserving the convergence guarantees?

9. Could the analysis be extended to allow for approximate minimization of the surrogate functions $g_n^v$? Would this improve practical performance?

10. The experiments demonstrate improved performance from smarter sampling schemes. Do you think further improvements are possible by actively selecting the "best" data points to sample?
