# [Set the Clock: Temporal Alignment of Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained language models (LMs) are trained on diverse corpora collected over a long time period, leading to a "temporal chaos" where their internal knowledge does not correspond to a consistent time. 
- This causes issues when deploying LMs, as they may give outdated or contradictory answers to questions.
- Prior work has focused on continually updating LMs with new knowledge, but does not evaluate or align the existing knowledge within LMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a dataset called TemporalAlignmentQA (TAQA) with 20K question-answer pairs that changed over 2000-2023.
- They evaluate several LMs on TAQA and find performance peaks on older years, confirming the temporal chaos. 
- They propose methods to align LMs to a target time, including time-aware prompting, target-year finetuning on TAQA data, and adaptive finetuning to elicit the LM's most recent knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- TAQA dataset enabling analysis of temporal knowledge in LMs
- Empirical demonstration and quantification of the "temporal chaos" problem
- Proposal of prompting and finetuning methods to align LMs to a target time
- Experiments showing finetuning can relatively improve performance in 2022 by over 60% for a 2022-pretrained LM
- Findings suggesting the sophistication of LMs' internal knowledge organization and the need to properly tune it

In summary, this paper identifies and formalizes the issue of temporal chaos in LMs, constructs a dataset to analyze it, and develops alignment techniques that show promising results in organizing LMs' sophisticated knowledge to target a consistent time.
