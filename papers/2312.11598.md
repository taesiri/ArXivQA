## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SkillDiffuser: Interpretable Hierarchical Planning via Skill Abstractions in Diffusion-Based Task Execution":

Problem:
- Generating coherent and long-horizon trajectories from high-level instructions is challenging for complex tasks requiring multiple sequential skills. 
- Previous diffusion models rely on predefined skill libraries which hinders scalability and end-to-end learning.  
- Without explicit skill learning, models cannot capture intricate inter-step dependencies and constraints, yielding fragmented trajectories.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SkillDiffuser, an end-to-end hierarchical planning framework integrating interpretable skill learning with conditional diffusion planning.
- A skill abstraction module learns discrete, human-understandable skill representations from visual observations and language instructions using vector quantization.
- These skill embeddings are used to condition a diffusion model to generate customized latent trajectories aligned with the skills.  
- An inverse dynamics network decodes motions between consecutive states to enable action inference.

Key Contributions:
- Combines hierarchical skill decomposition with conditional trajectory generation so SkillDiffuser can produce coherent behavior following abstract instructions across tasks.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex benchmarks like Meta-World and LoReL using only visual observations.
- Provides human-interpretable visualization of learned skill representations, bringing us closer to agents that acquire skills intuitively.
- Enables fully adaptive framework for directing diverse embodiments via transferable state-space plans by separating state prediction from motion decoding.

In summary, SkillDiffuser advances diffusion-based planning via end-to-end skill learning, enhancing coherence, adaptability and interpretability for executing ambitious instructions requiring coordination-intensive sequential steps.
