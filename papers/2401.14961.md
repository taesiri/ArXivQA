# [End-To-End Set-Based Training for Neural Network Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural networks have shown impressive performance on many complex tasks, but they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small perturbations to the inputs that cause the network to make incorrect predictions. This lack of robustness is problematic for deploying neural networks in safety-critical applications like self-driving cars. Prior work has focused on training robust neural networks using adversarial training, where the network is trained on adversarial examples. However, adversarial training does not provide formal guarantees on the network's robustness and verification of neural networks is still challenging.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel end-to-end set-based training procedure for neural networks to train robust models that are easier to formally verify. The key ideas are:

1) Use set-based computations to propagate entire sets of perturbed inputs through the network to get output sets during training. This captures the network's behavior on regions of inputs rather than individual samples. 

2) Define a set-based loss function that includes both a set-based evaluation of the point-wise loss and a term that minimizes the size of the output sets.

3) Derive a set-based backpropagation procedure to compute sets of gradients and update the network parameters by aggregating over these gradient sets.

The set-based training framework allows training networks that are robust over regions of inputs. Moreover, the smaller output sets make the trained networks easier to verify using set-based reachability analysis.

Contributions:

- First end-to-end set-based training procedure for neural networks
- Efficient image enclosure using novel linear approximations with smaller errors
- Demonstrates that set-training achieves higher robust accuracy than state-of-the-art adversarial training
- Set-trained networks are significantly easier to verify compared to adversarially trained networks

The experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST and SVHN datasets show that set-training outperforms adversarial training in terms of verified robust test accuracy for small perturbations. The key limitation is that approximation errors accumulate for larger perturbations, degrading performance. Addressing the scalability is left for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces the first end-to-end set-based training procedure for neural networks that trains robust models and simplifies their subsequent formal verification by using zonotopes to efficiently compute sets of gradients and update network parameters based on entire sets rather than individual samples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a novel set-based training procedure that trains robust neural networks and drastically simplifies their subsequent formal robustness verification. Specifically, the key aspects of their contribution are:

1) They present the first end-to-end set-based training approach for neural networks. While other robust training approaches use single gradients and inputs, their method trains neural networks using entire sets of gradients and inputs. 

2) They use set-based computations with zonotopes to efficiently compute sets of gradients for entire input sets. 

3) They update the parameters of neural networks by aggregating all the gradients instead of using single gradient updates.

4) Their experimental results show that their set-based approach effectively trains robust neural networks while significantly simplifying the subsequent verification of the trained networks. In many cases, their method outperforms training with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

In summary, their main contribution is an end-to-end set-based training procedure that trains robust neural networks and makes them much easier to verify formally, demonstrating strong empirical performance. This represents a promising new direction for robust neural network training.
