# [A General Model for Aggregating Annotations Across Simple, Complex, and   Multi-Object Annotation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Human annotations are critical for training AI systems, but annotators often disagree on the correct labels, especially for complex tasks beyond simple classification. Prior annotation aggregation models typically assume small label spaces permitting exact match comparisons and selection of the majority vote. They do not work well for complex annotations like translations, sequences, rankings, parses which have larger, structured label spaces.

Solution:
This paper proposes general distance-based aggregation models that can work with any complex annotation task, using the annotation evaluation metric also as a distance function. Their key idea is to model distances between labels rather than the labels themselves. 

Main Models:
1) Multidimensional Annotation Scaling (MAS): Models each annotation as a coordinate in space, placing them at distances matching observed annotation distances. It assumes a central latent ground truth and interprets annotation coordinate magnitudes as distances to ground truth.

2) Model of Ability, Difficulty and Distance (MADD): Simpler model avoiding coordinate space but still modeling annotator abilities, item difficulties, and distance-based probabilities for each annotation being the best.

3) Semi-supervised MAS: Overrides learned worker reliabilities with honeypot-based averages when some gold data is available.

4) Merging methods: Decompose complex annotations into primitives, merge those, then recompose into new annotations. 

5) Partitioning methods: For multi-object annotation tasks, partition object labels into clusters, aggregate within clusters, then recombine cluster aggregate labels.

Contributions:
1) New general semi-supervised method for complex aggregation, outperforming prior specialist models
2) Suite of unit tests ensuring model correctness 
3) Simulation studies characterizing when weighted aggregation is most beneficial
4) State of the art performance beating specialist models for diverse complex tasks 
5) Unified treatment of complex annotation aggregation

The paper makes a significant contribution in advancing complex annotation aggregation, enabling higher quality training data for developing AI systems. The proposed methods outperform prior state-of-the-art on both real and synthetic complex annotation tasks.
