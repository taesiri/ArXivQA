# [Interpretable Neural Architecture Search via Bayesian Optimisation with   Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07556)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to perform efficient and interpretable neural architecture search (NAS) using Bayesian optimization. Specifically, the key questions are:

1. How to make the graph-like and high-dimensional NAS search spaces amenable to Bayesian optimization, which typically works on continuous spaces? 

2. How to improve the sample efficiency and scalability of Bayesian optimization for NAS compared to existing methods?

3. How to gain useful interpretability from the NAS process, in terms of understanding which architectural motifs contribute positively or negatively to performance?

4. How can the interpretability be used to further improve the NAS search process, for example via warm starting a new related task?

To tackle these challenges, the core proposal is to use a Gaussian process surrogate model with the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. This allows Bayesian optimization to be directly applied on graph-structured architectures while exploiting the topological relationships between them. The graph kernel also provides interpretable features in terms of network motifs that correlate with performance. The paper shows this approach, termed NAS-BOWL, achieves state-of-the-art results on NAS benchmark datasets in terms of sample efficiency, final performance, and provides concrete examples of how interpretability enables improvement of the search process.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that using Bayesian optimization with graph kernels can lead to an efficient, scalable and interpretable approach to neural architecture search. The paper provides compelling evidence to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach for neural architecture search (NAS) called NAS-BOWL, which uses a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph kernel. This allows the method to effectively optimize over the graph-based search spaces commonly used in NAS.  

2. It introduces the idea of "interpretable NAS" where the method identifies interpretable network motifs and their impact on performance using the features extracted by the WL kernel. This provides insights into why certain architectures perform well.

3. It shows that the proposed surrogate model is highly data-efficient compared to prior NAS methods based on graph neural networks, requiring much less observed architecture data to achieve good performance prediction.

4. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark NAS datasets including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and the DARTS search space, demonstrating its effectiveness.

5. The extracted motifs can be used to guide architecture search, such as via transfer learning across tasks, providing a simple but effective demonstration of how the interpretability of the method can be leveraged.

In summary, the key innovations are using a GP+WL kernel surrogate for efficient NAS optimization, achieving interpretability via the WL features, and showing strong empirical performance on NAS benchmarks, all of which help advance the state-of-the-art in this area. The proposed interpretable NAS idea also opens up promising new research directions.

The current work focuses on demonstrating interpretability on cell-based search spaces like NAS-Bench and DARTS. The authors suggest expanding the approach to other types of search spaces as a direction for future work.

- Applying the method to multi-objective neural architecture search problems. The current work focuses on single-objective optimization of validation accuracy. The authors propose extending their method to capture trade-offs between multiple objectives like accuracy, model size, and latency.

- Further exploration of transfer learning. The paper gives a preliminary example of using interpretable motifs for warm-starting search on a new task. The authors suggest more extensive validation on tasks with varying degrees of similarity as future work. 

- Theoretical analysis of the method. While the current work is empirical, the authors suggest theoretical analysis of convergence guarantees and other properties would be beneficial.

- Extending beyond cell-based architectures. The current work relies on the graph representability of cell-based spaces. Applying the ideas to spaces without an explicit graph structure is noted as future work.

In summary, the main future directions mentioned are: expanding the approach to new types of search spaces, multi-objective optimization, more thorough investigation of transfer learning, theoretical analysis, and moving beyond cell-based search. Overall, the authors propose their method as a first step towards interpretable NAS, and suggest many avenues to extend the scope and utility of the approach in future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Bayesian optimisation approach for neural architecture search (NAS) that combines a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree graph kernel. The method, termed NAS-BOWL, represents neural network architectures as graphs and uses the WL kernel to capture their topological structure. This allows the GP surrogate model to directly operate on the graph domain, avoiding the need for manual feature engineering or encoding schemes. The WL kernel provides a natural way to compare neural architectures based on interpretable local and global patterns. By using gradient information from the GP surrogate, the impact of different motifs on performance can be assessed. This provides a level of interpretability and allows important architecture building blocks to be identified.  

Experiments demonstrate that NAS-BOWL achieves superior sample efficiency compared to existing NAS methods. The WL kernel captures meaningful architecture features that transfer well between datasets. Motifs can be used to prune inferior candidates or guide architecture generation when optimizing the acquisition function. The method is applied to benchmark datasets where it achieves state-of-the-art results. The integration of WL kernels and GP modelling provides a promising approach to architecture search that is highly data-efficient while also affording interpretability. Key advantages are the ability to operate directly on graph-based search spaces and leverage of topological patterns that impact performance.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph for the paper:

The paper proposes a Bayesian optimisation approach for neural architecture search that combines a Gaussian process surrogate model with the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. The key idea is to leverage the graph kernel to enable the Gaussian process to directly operate on the graph-like neural architecture search spaces. Specifically, the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel is used to extract interpretable features from the neural architectures that capture both local node attributes and global topological structures. The Gaussian process model trained on these features can then efficiently search the architecture space with very few queries. A key advantage of this approach is that it provides interpretability, enabling the identification of meaningful architectural motifs and an understanding of their impact on performance. The paper demonstrates strong performance on benchmark datasets, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art neural architecture search methods with higher sample efficiency. An exemplary application exploiting the interpretability for warm starting search on new tasks is also presented. Overall, the work introduces a sample-efficient, interpretable neural architecture search strategy through a novel combination of Bayesian optimisation and graph kernels.
