# [Damage GAN: A Generative Model for Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04862)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture called Damage GAN to improve GAN performance on imbalanced datasets. Damage GAN modifies the existing ContraD GAN framework by replacing its SimCLR contrastive learning module with a self-damaging contrastive learning (SDCLR) module. SDCLR addresses data imbalance issues by assigning larger losses to minority class samples. Experiments on full, partial, and imbalanced versions of the CIFAR-10 dataset show Damage GAN achieves better Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) than ContraD GAN and DCGAN on the imbalanced dataset. The distribution of generated samples across classes is also closer to the imbalanced dataset's distribution. However, FID scores indicate potentially lower image quality for Damage GAN's minority classes. Overall, Damage GAN demonstrates improved ability to handle imbalanced data versus prior GANs, but further research into factors influencing class-wise FID is warranted. Testing on larger, more complex datasets would also validate Damage GAN's usefulness for high-resolution, multi-label images.
