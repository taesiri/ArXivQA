# [Few shot clinical entity recognition in three languages: Masked language   models outperform LLM prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Named entity recognition (NER) is an important task for extracting information from clinical texts. However, clinical NER is challenging due to lack of large annotated datasets and domain complexity.  
- Recent approaches use large language models (LLMs) for few-shot learning, but their effectiveness for clinical NER is unclear, especially across languages.

Methods:
- The authors evaluate NER performance of 10 causal LM models (GPT-style) and 16 masked LM models (BERT-style) on 8 in-domain and 6 out-domain datasets in English, French and Spanish.
- They simulate a low-resource setting by limiting training data to 100 sentences per dataset. 
- For causal LMs, they design prompts with various features and optimize them with cross-validation. For masked LMs, they fine-tune a LSTM-CRF tagger.

Results:
- Masked LMs consistently outperform causal LMs on clinical NER across languages, with higher F1 scores and 10-50x lower CO2 emissions. 
- Clinical performance of both model types lags significantly behind their general domain performance.
- Among masked LMs, domain-specific variants perform on par with general variants on clinical NER.

Conclusions:
- Despite theoretical advantages, causal LMs underperform on few-shot clinical NER compared to masked LMs.
- All models are currently sub-optimal for clinical IE in low-resource settings.
- Rather than deployment, LMs could assist manual annotation.

Main Contributions:
- First comparative study of prompting techniques for clinical NER in English, French and Spanish
- Analysis of the gap between general and clinical performance for various LMs
- Evaluation of computational and carbon cost tradeoffs between model types


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates and compares the performance of masked language models and causal language models for few-shot named entity recognition in the clinical domain across three languages, finding that masked models consistently outperform causal models while having much lower carbon emissions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents and compares the most recent NER prompting techniques when applied to clinical NER in three languages: English, French and Spanish. This is the first work focused on NER prompts for languages other than English, and the first work comparing prompts for clinical NER.

2) It brings particular attention to tagging prompts, a novel NER prompting approach, and measures the improvements brought by it. 

3) It offers a fair comparison with the best-performing MLMs in a few-shot setting across languages, models, and prompt-structures when applied to few-shot clinical NER.

4) It conducts easily reproducible experiments, using easy-to-implement methods, exclusively on publicly available datasets and publicly available language models.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic and reproducible study comparing recent NER prompting techniques with standard MLMs on clinical NER across multiple languages in a few-shot setting.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares causal language models (CLMs) and masked language models (MLMs) for few-shot named entity recognition. What are the key differences in the architectures and pre-training objectives between these two types of models? 

2. The paper tests both constrained prompting techniques as well as more open-ended listing and tagging prompts for the CLMs. Can you explain the difference between these prompting strategies and why tagging prompts were ultimately preferred?

3. The greedy prompt feature search used for the CLMs incrementally tests adding each feature to find the best combination. How does this compare to an exhaustive grid search over all feature combinations? What are the tradeoffs?

4. The paper uses leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for optimizing the CLM prompts rather than holding out a separate validation set. Why is this important for a fair comparison to the MLMs in a true few-shot setting? 

5. What types of datasets were used for evaluation - both in the general domain and clinical domain? Why were both domains tested? How did the model performance compare between domains?

6. What specific metrics were used to evaluate the models? Why was micro-averaged F1 chosen as the primary metric rather than macro F1 or exact match accuracy?  

7. In addition to predictive performance, what other evaluation metric was used to compare the models? Why is estimating carbon emissions also an important consideration in NLP research?

8. The paper studies three languages - English, French, and Spanish. Were there any notable differences in the model performance trends across languages? If not, why does testing multiple languages strengthen the conclusions?

9. The results show MLMs outperform CLMs for few-shot clinical NER across metrics. Does this mean CLMs should not be used for this task? What are some potential use cases where CLMs could still be preferred?  

10. What directions for future work are suggested based on the limitations discussed? What types of follow-up experiments could provide additional evidence or insights beyond what was done in this study?
