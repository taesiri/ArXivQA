# [Boosting Semi-Supervised Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images With   Active Teaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18958)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Object detection in remote sensing images lacks sufficient labeled data due to the effort required for annotating objects. 
- Semi-supervised learning methods exploit unlabeled data but can be misled by noisy samples.  
- Active learning selects informative samples for labeling but may have redundancy between selected samples.

Proposed Solution:
- A semi-supervised object detection framework with active teaching (SSOD-AT) based on a teacher-student model.
- Introduce a RoI Comparison Module (RoICM) to generate confident pseudo-labels and identify uncertain images.
- Measure uncertainty of images based on divergence of teacher and student predictions.  
- Compute a diversity score using global class prototypes to reduce redundancy.
- Integrate uncertainty and diversity metrics as the query criterion for active sample selection.

Main Contributions:
- A novel method to boost semi-supervised detection via active learning for remote sensing images.
- The RoICM provides reliable pseudo-labels and evaluates image uncertainty.
- The global class prototype ensures diversity of selected samples. 
- Evaluated on DOTA and DIOR datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art semi-supervised and active learning methods.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective framework to improve object detection in remote sensing images by combining semi-supervised learning and active learning techniques through the design of a RoI comparison module and diversity measurement.
