# [Towards Long Term SLAM on Thermal Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Visual SLAM using thermal imagery is challenging due to poor feature extraction and matching caused by low contrast, noise, and temperature changes over time that invert gradients. This makes long-term mapping and relocalization very difficult. Existing SLAM systems rely on binary features like ORB that fail on thermal imagery.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose using the GlueStick learned feature matcher with SuperPoint features to achieve robust feature extraction and matching on thermal images, including across day-night intervals. They integrate this into the MCSLAM system and train a Bag of Words vocabulary for place recognition using matched SuperPoint features from day-night image pairs. 

Contributions:
1) Collection and release of extensive thermal video datasets with RTK GPS ground truth, including 24 hour static timelapses, matched day-night driving sequences, and unlabeled sequences.

2) Training and evaluation of a compact Bag of Words vocabulary using SuperPoint features that achieves over 90% recall at 100% precision for place recognition across 12 hour gaps on a test dataset.

3) Integration of SuperPoint features and GlueStick matching into the MCSLAM system to create a visual SLAM baseline that shows accurate local tracking on thermal video and relocalization across day-night intervals with median error around 2 meters.

The proposed system demonstrates that using learned features can enable robust mapping and relocalization for thermal SLAM across large appearance changes over time. The datasets and vocabulary also provide useful benchmarks for further research.
