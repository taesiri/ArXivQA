# [Task-Parameterized Imitation Learning with Time-Sensitive Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03506)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel constrained formulation of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on Riemannian manifolds that allows enforcing precise end-effector poses at specified times. This addresses a key limitation of standard probabilistic imitation learning approaches that cannot guarantee meeting precise pick-and-place constraints critical for industrial applications. Specifically, the authors fix the mean of a selected Gaussian component to a predefined desired pose at a specified time instance. After EM convergence, they scale the covariances to ensure exclusive activation of this component when querying the model at that time. This Constrained EM approach enforces the desired time-sensitive constraints within the actual learning process rather than in post-processing. The method is generalized to the Task-Parameterized GMM framework by constraining poses in multiple local frames and fusing predictions based on a time-varying weighting scheme. Experiments on a real KUKA robot for an inspection task validate that the approach succeeds in precisely reaching multiple desired end-effector poses at specified times, outperforming prior methods. Overall, the proposed technique facilitates the transfer of probabilistic imitation learning to industrial applications requiring verifiable precision guarantees.
