# [MobileARLoc: On-device Robust Absolute Localisation for Pervasive   Markerless Mobile AR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate visual localization is essential for markerless augmented reality (AR) applications where virtual content needs to be anchored properly in the physical world. However, accurate localization techniques like structure-based methods are computationally heavy hence not suitable for on-device pose estimation. In contrast, Absolute Pose Regressors (APRs) can provide fast on-device inference but suffer from limited accuracy. Meanwhile, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) used in AR frameworks like ARKit and ARCore displays high short-term accuracy but accumulates drift over time. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes MobileARLoc, a framework that combines an APR with a VIO system to leverage their complementary characteristics. The key ideas are:

1) Identify reliable APR predictions using VIO: Checks if relative pose between consecutive APR predictions matches with VIO to detect reliable predictions.  

2) Alignment Stage: When getting reliable predictions, calculate their average as reference pose and alignment transform between APR and VIO systems.

3) Pose Optimization Stage: For unreliable predictions, optimize pose by converting VIO pose to world coordinates using alignment transform.

4) Detect VIO drift and realign when needed.


Main Contributions:

1) Designed an APR-agnostic framework MobileARLoc that creates a feedback loop between APR and VIO to improve accuracy and reduce drift.

2) Implemented and evaluated with PoseNet and MS-Transformer APRs. MobileARLoc reduces mean translation error by up to 50% and mean rotation error by up to 66%.

3) Integrated into a real-life mobile AR application that can perform on-device pose estimation within 80ms using minimal storage.

In summary, MobileARLoc enables reliable and efficient on-device pose estimation to facilitate large-scale markerless mobile AR applications. By combining complementary strengths of APR and VIO, it achieves improved accuracy, robustness and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MobileARLoc, a framework that combines an absolute pose regressor with visual-inertial odometry to enable robust, accurate on-device camera localization for large-scale markerless mobile augmented reality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors design an APR-agnostic framework called MobileARLoc (MobileARLoc) that enables real-time on-device pose estimation by leveraging visual-inertial odometry (VIO) information to select reliable APR predictions and refine unreliable ones while compensating for VIO drift.

2. The authors implement and evaluate MobileARLoc over two popular APR models - PoseNet and MS-Transformer. MobileARLoc is shown to improve the accuracy of MS-Transformer by up to 47% on translation error and 66% on rotation error on average over three outdoor scenes.

3. The authors integrate MobileARLoc into a real-life mobile augmented reality application running on an iPhone 14 Pro Max. The system can perform pose estimation in less than 80ms with minimal storage and energy consumption, enabling large-scale markerless mobile AR.

In summary, the main contribution is the design of the MobileARLoc framework that combines APR and VIO to achieve high accuracy and low latency pose estimation suitable for mobile devices, overcoming limitations of using either approach alone. The system is demonstrated through extensive evaluations and integration into a practical AR application.
