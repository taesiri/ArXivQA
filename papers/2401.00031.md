## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised Pretrain-Then-Adapt pipeline to develop decision foundation models that can improve sample efficiency and generalization for downstream decision-making tasks. 

Problem: 
Traditional approaches to decision-making like reinforcement learning (RL) suffer from poor sample efficiency and generalization. Recent advances in self-supervised pretraining have shown success in natural language processing and computer vision by pretraining on large datasets before adapting to downstream tasks. However, self-supervised pretraining for decision-making is still underexplored, especially in the multi-task offline setting.

Proposed Solution:
1) Pretrain-Then-Adapt pipeline: Self-supervised pretraining on diverse offline datasets to extract useful knowledge, followed by adapting the pretrained model to downstream decision-making tasks.

2) Data Collection: Use datasets collected from multiple environments and tasks to encourage learning of common knowledge. Data can range from expert to random.

3) Pretraining Objectives: Learn representations by predicting future tokens (next action, rewards etc.) or filling in masked tokens based on context.

4) Downstream Adaptation: Fine-tune or directly adapt the pretrained model for downstream tasks like action prediction, dynamics prediction or trajectory prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of self-supervised pretraining for decision foundation models via the Pretrain-Then-Adapt pipeline
- Review of recent work on data collection, pretraining objectives and downstream adaptation strategies
- Identification of key challenges and future directions like better pretraining objectives, scaling to suboptimal data, developing continual learning capabilities and a unified evaluation framework

The paper provides a comprehensive survey of this emerging area and lays out the roadmap for developing intelligent agents that can leverage knowledge gained from foundation models to improve sample efficiency and generalization.
