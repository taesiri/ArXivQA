# [A Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantization Strategies for Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Increasing model size of large language models (LLMs) improves performance but also increases compute/memory costs, making deployment difficult. 
- Quantization techniques can reduce bits needed for weights/activations with minimal performance loss, but evaluation of quantized LLMs is limited.
- Impact of quantization on instruction-tuned LLMs not well understood. Also relation between perplexity and benchmark performance.
- Evaluation often limited to language modeling and few classification tasks. Performance on other benchmarks unclear.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose structured evaluation framework with 3 key dimensions - efficiency, knowledge & capacity, and alignment.
- Conduct extensive experiments on quantized instruction-tuned LLMs with varying parameter scales using 10 diverse benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- Show LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance comparable to non-quantized counterparts.  
- Find perplexity serves as reliable indicator for quantized LLM performance on most benchmarks.
- Identify isolating outlier weights crucial for SpQR to effectively quantize to extreme 2-bit level.
- Analysis reveals engineering challenges - quantization requires substantial effort and hardware support for memory and speed optimization.
- Find quantized LLMs with larger parameter scales can outperform smaller non-quantized LLMs given similar memory budgets.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization techniques on instruction-tuned LLMs using a structured evaluation approach. Key findings are that 4-bit quantization works well, perplexity correlates with performance, and substantial hardware and software efforts are still needed to enable faster inference and reduced memory footprint.
