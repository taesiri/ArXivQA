## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ICAT: An Indoor Connected and Autonomous Testbed for Vehicle Computing":

Problem:
Outdoor autonomous driving testbeds are expensive to build and maintain. Indoor testbeds offer a more affordable alternative but often lack robust sensing, computing capabilities, and connectivity required for advanced autonomous driving research. Existing indoor testbeds rely on centralized motion capturing systems for localization which limits testing of decentralized systems. They also lack onboard computing power and connectivity.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes the Indoor Connected Autonomous Testbed (ICAT) to address limitations of prior indoor testbeds. Key capabilities of ICAT include:

- Digital Twin System: Integrates with CARLA and SUMO simulators. Enables centralized and decentralized testing. Accelerates algorithm development through simulation.

- Vehicle Computing and Connectivity: Onboard computing devices on robots support vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication and decentralized autonomy. Computing platforms enable federated machine learning experiments.  

- Localization: Uses NDT SLAM for accurate, decentralized localization without relying on expensive motion capture systems. Enables more realistic autonomous driving testing.

- Traffic Management: Developed optimized traffic management system that plans trajectories for vehicles and handles conflicts. More efficient than default CARLA traffic manager.

- Custom Robots: HydraT robots designed specifically for ICAT with advanced sensors, computing (Nvidia Orin) and auto recharge stations.

Key Contributions:

- Addresses key limitations of prior indoor driving testbeds by enabling decentralized localization, computing and connectivity.

- Integrates digital twin technology for efficient algorithm testing and development.

- Demonstrates dual use of robotic fleet for both intelligent transportation system testing and distributed computing experiments.

- Provides optimized traffic management system with multi-agent trajectory planning and conflict resolution. 

- Introduces custom HydraT robots tailored for indoor autonomous driving research.

In summary, ICAT pushes state-of-the-art in indoor driving testbeds through its unique combination of decentralized systems, digital twin technology, vehicle computing and innovative robot design. Case studies validate its capabilities.
