# [Approximation Algorithms for Preference Aggregation Using CP-Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09162)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies approximation algorithms for the problem of aggregating conditional preferences represented as Conditional Preference Networks (CP-nets). It first shows that finding an optimal aggregate CP-net is intractable, even when restricting the objective function to only consider inconsistencies over swap pairs (pairs of outcomes differing in one attribute). The paper analyzes a trivial algorithm that outputs the best input CP-net, proving it guarantees a 2-approximation, and that this bound cannot be improved in general. However, it shows that under a symmetry condition on inputs, this trivial algorithm attains a 4/3-approximation. The paper then proposes an improved approximation algorithm that considers aggregating the CP-nets for each of the input parent sets separately, returning the best result. This algorithm runs in polynomial time and is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the trivial algorithm. Theoretical analysis is provided on the performance, including a family of inputs for which the improved algorithm finds optimal solutions, while the approximation ratio of the trivial algorithm is lower bounded by 3/2, highlighting the strict improvement in solution quality attainable.
