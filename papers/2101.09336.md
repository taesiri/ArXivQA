## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive survey on hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS). NAS has become a popular technique for automating the design of neural network architectures. However, the architectures found by NAS tend to be large and complex, making them impractical to deploy on resource-constrained hardware like mobile devices. Hardware-aware NAS (HW-NAS) incorporates hardware constraints like latency and energy usage into the search process, allowing efficient architectures to be found that trade off some accuracy for improved deployment properties. 

The paper categorizes existing HW-NAS methods based on their formulation of the search space, search strategy, hardware cost estimation techniques, and other considerations like quantization and pruning. Four main search space formulations are identified: optimizing hyperparameters of a fixed architecture, full architecture search, cell-based search, and hierarchical search. Major search strategy classes include reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, gradient-based methods, and Bayesian optimization. Hardware costs are estimated by real measurements, lookups, analytical models, or learned cost models. The paper also discusses trends, limitations, and future directions for HW-NAS research. It provides a valuable organization and analysis of techniques for finding neural architectures suited to real-world applications with hardware constraints.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a neural architecture search method called MorphNet that reduces the computational cost of neural networks by learning a smaller network architecture. MorphNet starts with an over-parameterized network and iteratively prunes unimportant connections to find an efficient subnetwork. The pruning decisions are based on a sparsity regularization loss that penalizes activations. The sparsity regularizer removes activations that do not significantly affect the network's output. This pruning approach allows MorphNet to automatically find compressed architectures tailored to a specific task that maintain accuracy while reducing the number of parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs). Experiments show MorphNet is able to find compressed models for image classification and translation tasks that match or outperform hand-designed compressed architectures like MobileNet and ShuffleNet in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
