# [Large Language Models are Contrastive Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Prompting methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) are crucial for enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot CoT may generate incorrect reasoning steps while few-shot CoT requires expensive human labeling of reasoning examples.  

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "contrastive prompting" which instructs LLMs to generate both correct and incorrect answers when solving problems. This triggers LLMs' self-awareness of potential errors without needing human-labeled examples.

Method:
- Apply a simple trigger prompt like "Let's give a correct and a wrong answer" before the LLM generates answers. 
- First extract the reasoning text from the LLM using the trigger. Then extract the final answer using the reasoning text.
- Can combine with CoT by prompting "Let's think step-by-step and give both a correct and wrong answer".

Experiments:
- Evaluated on 12 datasets spanning arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic and logical reasoning tasks. 
- Used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as base models.
- Contrastive prompting improves over zero-shot CoT on most tasks and achieves comparable or better performance than few-shot CoT.
- Combining contrastive prompting and CoT yields best results, surpassing state-of-the-art on some datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed a simple yet effective contrastive prompting approach to elicit self-awareness of errors in LLMs without human labeling.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning datasets.
- Demonstrated LLMs have decent contrastive reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked via prompting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Contrastive Prompting, a novel prompting method that improves reasoning capabilities of large language models by eliciting self-awareness of potential errors through generating both correct and incorrect answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel prompting approach called Contrastive Prompting (CP) to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to prompt the LLM to generate both correct and incorrect answers for a given question, without requiring any manually labeled examples. This elicits self-awareness in the LLM regarding potential errors and enables it to actively avoid them. 

The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces Contrastive Prompting, a simple yet effective method to guide the reasoning process of LLMs by making them compare correct and incorrect answers.

2) It demonstrates that Contrastive Prompting significantly boosts the performance of LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on a diverse set of 12 reasoning tasks, without using any hand-crafted examples.

3) It shows that Contrastive Prompting not only outperforms baseline methods like zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT on several tasks, but also combines well with CoT prompting variants to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel prompting technique that elicits an LLM's self-awareness of potential mistakes, guides its reasoning, and does not require manually labeled reasoning examples. This simplicity coupled with strong empirical performance makes it an impactful contribution.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the contrastive prompting method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the contrastive prompting method is inspired by how humans can learn from both their correct and incorrect actions. Can you elaborate more on the cognitive science theories behind this inspiration and how it relates to improving language models?

2. The two-stage prompting approach involves first extracting the reasoning then the final answer. What are the advantages and disadvantages of separating these two steps compared to doing them jointly? Are there situations where a joint approach would work better?  

3. When combining contrastive prompting (CP) with other methods like few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT), should CP be applied before or after CoT? What are the tradeoffs and why?

4. The paper explores the impact of the number of incorrect answers generated by the model. Is there an optimal number? Does this depend on the task? How could the model determine the right number of contrastive examples to generate automatically?

5. Could the incorrect answers potentially reinforce harmful biases in the model if it generates insensitive or unethical contrastive examples? How might this issue be addressed?  

6. The model seems to perform well on mathematical reasoning but less so on symbolic reasoning tasks that also involve discrete steps. Why might this be the case? How could contrastive prompting be tailored to symbolic reasoning?

7. Error analysis shows the model often generates invalid contrastive examples. What characteristics of valid vs invalid contrastive examples could be leveraged to improve the method? How might the model learn this distinction?

8. The authors mention contrastive prompting enhances model self-awareness of potential errors, but how does this actually manifest in the model internals and learned representations? What experiments could analyze this?

9. The method does not seem to have been tested on smaller language models. How would you expect performance to change with model size? What limitations might emerge with smaller models? 

10. The method relies on prompting but does not update model parameters. How difficult would it be to create a fine-tuning approach rather than rely solely on prompting at inference time? What challenges need to be addressed?
