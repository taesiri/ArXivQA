## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects covered in the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the performance of ChatGPT as a question answering system, given its rising prominence as an AI model for natural language tasks.  
- Assessing strengths and limitations of ChatGPT in extracting answers from provided paragraphs, a core capability for question answering systems.
- Analyzing issues like response hallucination and impact of question complexity.
- Comparing ChatGPT's QA abilities to other state-of-the-art models across metrics such as F1 score, accuracy etc.

Proposed Solution:
- Utilized well-established QA datasets like SQuAD, NewsQA and PersianQuAD spanning English and Persian languages. 
- Designed prompts specifically for testing answer extraction from paragraphs.  
- Quantified performance using Exact Match, F1 Score and Recall metrics.
- Compared performance on scenarios with and without context paragraphs.
- Analyzed different question types and difficulties.  

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis focused specifically on evaluating ChatGPT as a question answering system.
- Showcased the importance of surrounding context for enhancing ChatGPT's QA performance.  
- Demonstrated ChatGPT's competence but lower effectiveness than specialized QA models.
- Highlighted ChatGPT's aptitude in simpler factual questions vs complex ones.
- Revealed ChatGPT's tendency for hallucinated responses to questions lacking answers.
- Provided benchmark for gauging future progress in developing ChatGPT for QA tasks.

In summary, the paper offers valuable insights into strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT as a QA system through rigorous experimentation and evaluation across diverse datasets and metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT as a question answering system across multiple datasets and languages, assessing its performance on answer extraction, response hallucination, question complexity, and impact of context compared to other state-of-the-art models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT as a question answering system, assessing its capabilities on key metrics like F-score, exact match, and recall. 

2. It compares ChatGPT's performance to other state-of-the-art models on popular QA datasets like SQuAD, NewsQA, and PersianQuAD across both English and Persian languages.

3. It analyzes ChatGPT's ability to extract answers from provided paragraphs, revealing improved performance when context is given compared to no surrounding passage.  

4. It explores the impact of prompt engineering, showing two-step queries enhance precision over one-step, particularly for questions lacking explicit answers.

5. It evaluates ChatGPT's competence on simpler factual questions versus more complex "how" and "why" questions.

6. It detects and highlights occurrences of hallucination where ChatGPT provides responses despite no answer available in the provided context.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights into strengths, weaknesses and areas of improvement for ChatGPT as a question answering system through a robust, multi-faceted evaluation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the proposed method in this paper:

1. The paper employs a tailored two-step prompt design for addressing type 2 QA datasets which may contain unanswerable questions. Could you elaborate on the reasoning and expected benefits behind this two-step prompting approach compared to a one-step design?  

2. The paper argues that ChatGPT performs significantly better on question answering when provided surrounding context paragraphs, as opposed to questions asked in isolation. What factors account for this substantial difference in performance? How can ChatGPT's design be enhanced to bridge this gap?

3. When evaluating ChatGPT's performance across varying levels of question difficulty, intriguing cyclic patterns were observed in the F1 scores, rather than a direct correlation. What underlying mechanisms might explain this cyclic relationship between question complexity and model performance?  

4. For the NewsQA dataset evaluations related to hallucination, what fraction of questions were confirmed to have no answers yet still received responses from ChatGPT? What steps could be taken to further analyze or reduce such hallucinatory responses?  

5. Considering the disparity between ChatGPT's performance on English QA datasets compared to PersianQuad, what architectural modifications or training approaches could help improve its non-English language QA abilities?  

6. The evaluation results indicate ChatGPT struggles with complex inference-based questions starting with "why" and "how" compared to fact-based questions. How might the model's reasoning and explanatory capabilities be enhanced to address such weaknesses?

7. What other non-English languages beyond Persian should be included to enable a more comprehensive assessment of ChatGPT's multilingual QA proficiencies and limitations? 

8. How effective were the chosen evaluation metrics of F1 score, exact match and recall in capturing meaningful performance differences across models and datasets? What additional metrics could provide further insights?  

9. Could the proposed evaluation framework incorporating prompt building, answer generation, and metrics analysis be extended to assess generative models beyond just ChatGPT? What would need to be configured?

10. For situations where answers must be extracted from context paragraphs, should any constraints be added to the prompts to avoid hallucinated responses or over-reliance on external world knowledge rather than focusing solely on provided context?
