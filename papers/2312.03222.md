# [Predicting Scores of Various Aesthetic Attribute Sets by Learning from   Overall Score Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03222)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called F2S for image aesthetic attribute evaluation that can predict aesthetic attribute scores without requiring attribute-level labels. The key idea is to replace attribute labels with attribute-specific feature extractors pre-trained on various vision tasks. Specifically, features related to color, lighting, objects, depth of field, etc. are extracted using models like MaskFormer, DETR, a sky illumination estimation model, and more. These features are combined with global aesthetic features from a ResNet50 fine-tuned on AVA into attribute-specific branches to predict scores. A contribution module helps quantify how much each attribute branch contributes to the overall aesthetic score. Experiments on datasets like AADB and EVA validate that this semi-supervised approach achieves comparable performance to supervised methods in correlating predicted attribute scores with ground truth, demonstrating the feasibility of learning meaningful attribute evaluations from just overall aesthetic scores. A key benefit is removing the need for intensive attribute-level annotation. The framework is flexible to add/remove attribute branches as needed for analyzing images from various domains like portraits, landscapes, etc. Overall, this is an innovative approach to make image aesthetic attribute analysis more practical.
