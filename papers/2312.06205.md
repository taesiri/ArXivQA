# [The Journey, Not the Destination: How Data Guides Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Diffusion models can generate highly realistic images, but attributing specific aspects of generated images back to training data remains challenging. Such attribution is important for detecting issues like memorization, bias propagation, and understanding how data guides the generative process.

Proposed Solution
- The paper introduces a framework for attributing images generated by diffusion models back to the training data. The key idea is to attribute each step of the diffusion process separately, tracking how training data influences the distribution of possible outputs at each step.

- They formally define data attribution for diffusion models as assigning scores to training points indicating their influence on properties of the conditional distribution $p_{\theta}(\cdot|\bx_t)$ at each step $t$. 

- They propose two metrics for evaluating attributions based on counterfactual impact: (1) linear datamodeling score based on subsets of training data, and (2) change in distributions when retraining without top influencers.

- They adapt the TracIn method to efficiently compute attributions for diffusion models by linearizing and using multiple checkpoints to estimate parameter change and model output change components.

Key Contributions
- Formalized notion of data attribution tailored to diffusion models, with step-by-step attribution tracking evolution of output distribution 

- Proposed evaluation metrics grounded in counterfactual analysis of output distributions under interventions on training set

- Adapted prior method (TracIn) for efficient attribution computation by addressing challenges like high-dimensional outputs

- Demonstrated approach yields interpretable, counterfactually validated attributions on CIFAR and COCO models, enabling analysis of how data guides these models
