# [Sequence-to-Sequence Language Models for Character and Emotion Detection   in Dream Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The analysis of dreams, including identifying characters and their emotions, has historically relied on the labor-intensive manual annotation of dream narratives based on schemes like Hall and Van de Castle (HVdC). 
- Automating this annotation would accelerate quantitative dream research by making thousands of annotated narratives readily available. However, previous attempts at automation have had limitations in capturing all aspects of the HVdC annotations.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a neural sequence-to-sequence model that takes a dream narrative as input and generates as output the HVdC annotations for characters and their emotions in natural language.
- Convert HVdC symbol codes (e.g. "1FKA") into natural language (e.g. "individual alive female known adult") so the model can better exploit semantics.  
- Use a pretrained transformer model, finetuned on manually annotated dream narratives, to perform this text generation task in an end-to-end fashion.

Contributions:
- First fully automated system for jointly predicting characters and their emotions according to the HVdC scheme. 
- Comprehensive analysis of different model variations and phenomena to provide insights into performance.
- Comparison showing supervised models significantly outperform large autoregressive model with in-context learning.
- Release of model and English subset of annotated DreamBank dataset to further research.
- Demonstration that language models can effectively address this complex annotation task, accelerating quantitative dream analysis.

In summary, the key innovation is framing HVdC annotation as a text generation problem to leverage neural language model capabilities, providing an automated tool to unlock thousands of annotated dream narratives for quantitative research.
