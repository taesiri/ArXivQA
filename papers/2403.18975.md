# [A Novel Corpus of Annotated Medical Imaging Reports and Information   Extraction Results Using BERT-based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18975)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of annotated radiology report datasets for natural language processing tasks like information extraction. Existing datasets are limited in size and schema complexity.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors create a new radiology report corpus called CAMIR with 609 reports annotated for indications, lesions, and medical problems.

- The annotation schema includes trigger spans, arguments with text spans only, and arguments with both text spans and normalized value labels.

- Arguments are normalized to an anatomical hierarchy based on SNOMED-CT concepts. 

- The corpus has train, validation, and test splits with a total of 41% doubly annotated reports and the rest singly annotated.

Methods:
- Two neural extraction architectures are explored - mSpERT and PL-Marker++. Both are BERT-based models that identify triggers and arguments.

- mSpERT uses a single model with multiple output layers to jointly predict entities and relations. 

- PL-Marker++ has a three-stage pipeline with separate entity detection, relation classification, and argument value classification modules.

Results:
- Performance is evaluated using span overlap equivalence between predictions and ground truth.

- Extraction results are presented for triggers, arguments, and relation tuples on the CAMIR test set.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of CAMIR, a new radiology report corpus for information extraction
- Complex annotation schema normalized for anatomical concepts
- Analysis of two neural extraction architectures on the dataset
- Rigorous comparison using span overlap equivalence

The paper offers a new benchmark radiology NLP dataset and thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art information extraction methods.
