# [RadioGalaxyNET: Dataset and Novel Computer Vision Algorithms for the   Detection of Extended Radio Galaxies and Infrared Hosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00306)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces RadioGalaxyNET, a novel dataset and set of computer vision models for detecting extended radio galaxies and their corresponding infrared hosts. The dataset contains 2,800 multimodal images from ASKAP radio data and WISE infrared data, with 4,155 labelled instances across categories like FR-I, FR-II, FR-x, and R. The images have pixel-level annotations including bounding boxes, masks, and infrared host positions. Several multimodal detection models are proposed, including Gal-DETR, Gal-Deformable DETR and Gal-DINO, which leverage transformers and keypoint detection to concurrently identify radio galaxies and infrared hosts. Additional comparative models are also evaluated, including Gal-SIOD, Gal-Faster RCNN and Gal-YOLOv8. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from Gal-DINO, with Average Precision scores of 53.7\% and 48.1\% for bounding box and keypoint detection respectively. The dataset and models provide an effective solution for cataloging radio galaxies in next-generation surveys through simultaneous multimodal detection. The availability of this curated dataset paves the way for developing more advanced techniques.
