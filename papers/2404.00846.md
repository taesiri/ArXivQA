# [Transfer Learning with Point Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores using transformer-based models, specifically Point Transformers, for 3D point cloud classification. Point clouds lack inherent ordering and resemble sets of points in space. Hence, self-attention mechanisms that operate on sets are well-suited for point cloud data. The authors experiment with applying Point Transformers for classification on the ModelNet10 dataset and then finetuning the model for the 3D MNIST dataset.

Methodology: 
The Point Transformer architecture uses vector self-attention to capture spatial relationships between points. Multiple Point Transformer layers are combined with transition down blocks to build the classifier. The model is first trained on the ModelNet10 shape classification dataset. Then, it is finetuned on the 3D MNIST dataset generated from the 2D MNIST dataset. For comparison, a separate Point Transformer model is trained from scratch on 3D MNIST. 

Results:
The model achieves 87.7% training accuracy on ModelNet10, showing good feature learning. However, finetuning on 3D MNIST gives only 26% accuracy compared to 24.6% for training from scratch. This indicates that the features required for classifying both datasets are fundamentally different. Hence, transfer learning is not very effective despite faster convergence. The paper hypothesizes that attention may not learn optimal features for 3D MNIST. A simpler MLP model performs better, achieving 92% accuracy.

Conclusions:
If source and target datasets are too dissimilar with distribution shifts, knowledge transfer using finetuning may not improve performance over training from scratch. The paper provides insights into transformer capabilities for 3D point cloud classification and limitations of transfer learning between datasets with very different distributions. More analysis is required regarding attention models and 3D MNIST feature learning.
