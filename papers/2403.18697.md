# [The Invalsi Benchmark: measuring Language Models Mathematical and   Language understanding in Italian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18697)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate language models' ability to understand math and language in Italian. This is an issue since Italian is a high-resource language but there are few Italian-specific models and benchmarks. 

- Existing benchmarks are often just translations of English benchmarks rather than being designed for Italian.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce two new datasets - Invalsi MATH and Invalsi ITA - based on real standardized tests taken by Italian students to assess math and language understanding.

- Invalsi MATH contains 422 math questions in 4 formats: multiple choice, true/false, give a number, fill-in-the-blank.

- Invalsi ITA contains language understanding questions in 4 formats: multiple choice, binary, extract answers from passage, miscellaneous open-ended.

- The datasets allow benchmarking language models against average human performance.

Contributions:
- First native Italian benchmark datasets to specifically test math and language understanding abilities.

- Evaluation of 9 language models on the new benchmarks, including English-only, multilingual, and Italian fine-tuned models.

- Best models achieve ~60% on Invalsi MATH but it remains a challenging benchmark.

- Analysis shows multilingual pre-training is better than Italian fine-tuning alone for strong performance in Italian.

In summary, the key contributions are two new challenging Italian test sets for math and language understanding, benchmark results for various models, and insights about the need for multilingual pre-training to achieve strong Italian performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents two new benchmarks, Invalsi MATH and Invalsi ITA, to evaluate language models' mathematical and language understanding abilities in Italian, based on real student assessment tests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. Two new datasets for evaluating language models' mathematical and language understanding abilities in Italian: Invalsi MATH and Invalsi ITA. These are the first natively Italian benchmarks of this kind.

2. An evaluation of a selection of relevant language models on these math and language understanding datasets, including a custom fine-tuning of the LLama 2 70B model on Italian data. This is reported to be the largest such fine-tune openly available for Italian.

The paper introduces these new benchmark datasets, describes how they were created, and presents results of evaluating several state-of-the-art language models on the benchmarks. A key finding is that fine-tuning on Italian data helps, but multilingual pre-training is still important for good performance in Italian specifically.

The paper introduces two new benchmark datasets based on real student assessment tests in Italy to evaluate language models' mathematical and linguistic understanding abilities when processing Italian text. It compares performance across models with varying pre-training and fine-tuning approaches, including a custom fine-tuned 70B parameter model. Key findings relate to the impact of multilingual pre-training versus Italian fine-tuning. Future work is proposed around prompts, multimodal extensions, etc. But those are some of the central terms and topics covered in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces two new datasets, Invalsi MATH and Invalsi ITA, to evaluate language models' mathematical and language understanding abilities in Italian. Can you elaborate on the process of creating these datasets and the rationale behind basing them on real student assessment tests?

2. The paper categorizes the Invalsi MATH questions into 4 types - multiple choice, true/false, number, and fill in the gap. Can you explain the unique challenges and considerations in evaluating language models on each of these question types? 

3. The paper found a significant gap between automated and human evaluation accuracies on the Invalsi MATH dataset. What are some potential reasons for this discrepancy? How can human evaluation provide additional insights that automated methods may miss?

4. The authors fine-tuned LLama models of varying sizes on an Italian dataset called Camoscio. Can you explain this fine-tuning process in more detail? What hyperparameters and techniques were used? How was the fine-tuning dataset created?

5. The results show superior performance from models pre-trained in a multilingual setting compared to English pre-trained models fine-tuned on Italian data. Why do you think multilingual pre-training provides such a significant boost? 

6. Error analysis revealed issues with Italian fine-tuned models clearly framing answers compared to English fine-tuned models. What characteristics of the Italian fine-tuning datasets could be contributing to this effect?

7. The paper focuses exclusively on textual questions from the Invalsi assessments. How could the inclusion of image-based questions expand the scope and difficulty of these benchmarks? What additional model capabilities would be required?

8. The authors use a "chain of thought" prompting approach but do not explore different prompt formulations. What impact could alternative prompts have? What prompt design principles should be followed?  

9. Beyond overall accuracy, what other evaluation metrics and analyses could provide additional insight into model performance on mathematical and linguistic tasks?

10. The paper concludes that current models still have much room for improvement on these benchmarks. What specific areas of model architecture, pre-training techniques, dataset collection, etc. could help close this performance gap?
