# [Severity Controlled Text-to-Image Generative Model Bias Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02530)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are gaining popularity but their intrinsic biases and potential for malicious manipulation is under-explored. 
- Existing bias manipulation methods require retraining models which is computationally expensive and lacks flexibility in controlling the severity of manipulation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a technique to efficiently manipulate the embedding space of language models to control the bias and manipulate the outputs of downstream T2I models. 
- By interpolating and extrapolating embeddings using vector algebra between labeled points, precise control can be achieved over bias without retraining models.
- The severity of manipulation can be conveniently tuned as well.

Key Contributions:
1. A method to precisely control prompts by manipulating language embeddings for more accurate image generation in T2I models. Allows generating images hard to describe textually.
2. Tuning embeddings to mitigate gender, age and racial biases in T2I outputs by balancing representations of social groups. 
3. Injecting computationally efficient backdoors in T2I pipelines using semantically-null triggers. Severity of attack can be conveniently controlled.

The technique leverages vector algebra to transform language embeddings between labeled clusters. It enables prompt engineering for precise control, mitigating social biases by balancing representations, and injecting tunable backdoors activated by triggers - all without accessing model parameters or retraining, making it efficient.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to efficiently manipulate text-to-image models by interpolating and extrapolating language embeddings to precisely control model bias for applications like prompt engineering, mitigating social biases, and injecting backdoors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A technique to manipulate text-to-image (T2I) models by interpolating and extrapolating the language model embedding space. This allows for precise control over the embedding output to generate images that would be difficult to describe using just text prompts. 

2) Leveraging the embedding manipulation approach, the paper contributes a method to shift the language embedding output to balance the frequency of different classes being generated. In particular, it demonstrates mitigating gender, age, and racial biases through this method. 

3) The paper extends the embedding manipulation technique to implement a dynamic, computationally-efficient backdoor attack with semantically-null triggers. This also enables controlling the severity of the attack manipulation based on which triggers are present.

In summary, the main contribution is the language model embedding space manipulation technique and its applications for precise prompt engineering, bias mitigation, and backdoor attacks in T2I models. The key aspects are the computational efficiency, flexibility in severity control, and not needing access to model weights or training.
