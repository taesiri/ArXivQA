# [Unsupervised 3D Shape Reconstruction by Part Retrieval and Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01999)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we decompose 3D shapes into a set of parts in an unsupervised manner, while using high-quality geometric primitives and maintaining control over the type of decomposition produced?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Retrieving and assembling parts from a user-provided 3D part library can allow unsupervised decomposition of shapes into clean geometry parts.

2) Having control over the part library will give control over the type of decomposition produced for the same input shape.

3) An iterative optimization procedure can be designed to efficiently search the combinatorial space of part retrieval and placement in order to reconstruct the input shape.

In summary, the central goal is unsupervised decomposition of 3D shapes using an input part library, with a focus on enabling control over the decomposition through the choice of parts. The method proposed is based on an optimization scheme that searches for good part selections and placements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Proposes an unsupervised framework that retrieves and poses 3D parts from a given part library to reconstruct 3D target shapes. This allows reconstructing shapes using clean, high-quality parts while still offering control over the type of decomposition through the choice of part library.

- Formulates the discrete combinatorial search problem of part retrieval as a continuous optimization problem by representing the part library on a learned latent space via a variational autoencoder.

- Presents an iterative optimization procedure with three key phases: direct part pose optimization, part segmentation and re-encoding to shift parts to uncovered regions, and borrowing part configurations from similar well-reconstructed shapes. This allows escaping local optima.

- Demonstrates reconstructing shapes using parts from different categories, enabling applications like stylized reconstruction. Also shows higher reconstruction accuracy than existing methods.

- The ability to reconstruct shapes in an unsupervised way using arbitrary reusable 3D part assets has applications in computer graphics and vision. The control over decomposition type also aids interpretation and editing of shapes.

In summary, the key innovation is an unsupervised framework for reconstructing shapes by retrieving and posing parts that combines the benefits of prior parametric and neural decomposition approaches in terms of control, accuracy, and reusability. The optimization procedure and part latent space help make this discrete combinatorial problem tractable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an unsupervised method for reconstructing 3D shapes by retrieving and assembling parts from a user-provided library, enabling control over the geometry and type of decomposition while achieving higher accuracy than existing unsupervised approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research on unsupervised 3D shape decomposition and reconstruction:

- Compared to methods that use simple parametric primitives like cuboids (e.g. Tulsiani et al., Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge), this method can produce higher fidelity reconstructions using more complex part geometries from a user-provided part library. However, parametric methods offer more control over the type of decomposition.

- Compared to methods that learn neural primitive shape spaces (e.g. Paschalidou et al., Neural Parts), this method allows more control over the part geometries through the part library while achieving competitive or better reconstruction accuracy. However, learned neural primitive methods don't require a part library.

- Compared to retrieval-based reconstruction methods (e.g. Uy et al., Joint 3D Shape Retrieval and Deformation), this method works with a library of parts rather than complete shapes. This allows reconstruction of shapes that are very different from any complete shape in the library.

- Compared to Structure Recovery by Part Assembly, this method only requires a part library, not a shape library, allowing more flexible reconstructions. However, that method may work better when consistent ground truth part segmentations are available for the shape category.

- Overall, a key advantage of this method is the increased control over part geometries and decomposition type via the part library, while still being fully unsupervised. The iterative optimization procedure is also shown to achieve strong quantitative results. A limitation is the need for a suitable part library.

In summary, this paper presents an approach that combines advantages of existing methods, while offering a novel way to direct unsupervised 3D shape decomposition via the part library input. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporating physical stability and plausibility constraints into the optimization process to produce more realistic part arrangements and contact relationships. The current method focuses purely on geometry matching without considering physics.

- Extending the method to handle incomplete or partial input shapes, such as depth scans. The current method assumes a complete volumetric representation of the target shape.

- Exploring different encoder architectures and training techniques for learning the part latent space. The VAE used currently could likely be improved. 

- Using amortized inference and/or neural rendering techniques to accelerate the optimization process. The current retrieval and optimization process is slow.

- Applying the method to additional shape decomposition tasks such as shape editing, stylization, and compression. The paper focuses on reconstruction but the representations could enable other applications.

- Comparing the method to other part-based deep generative models. The comparisons in the paper are mainly to primitive-based decomposition methods.

- Developing unsupervised methods to select the number of parts automatically rather than needing to run the method with different numbers of parts.

- Exploring whether semantic or category-specific shape priors could help produce more plausible part-based reconstructions. The current method uses no shape priors.

In summary, the key suggested directions are: incorporating physics constraints, handling incomplete shapes, improving the part encoder, accelerating the optimization, applying the method to other tasks, comparing to other part-based models, automatically selecting the number of parts, and exploring the use of shape priors.
