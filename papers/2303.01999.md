# [Unsupervised 3D Shape Reconstruction by Part Retrieval and Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01999)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we decompose 3D shapes into a set of parts in an unsupervised manner, while using high-quality geometric primitives and maintaining control over the type of decomposition produced?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Retrieving and assembling parts from a user-provided 3D part library can allow unsupervised decomposition of shapes into clean geometry parts.

2) Having control over the part library will give control over the type of decomposition produced for the same input shape.

3) An iterative optimization procedure can be designed to efficiently search the combinatorial space of part retrieval and placement in order to reconstruct the input shape.

In summary, the central goal is unsupervised decomposition of 3D shapes using an input part library, with a focus on enabling control over the decomposition through the choice of parts. The method proposed is based on an optimization scheme that searches for good part selections and placements.
