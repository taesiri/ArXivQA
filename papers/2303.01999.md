# [Unsupervised 3D Shape Reconstruction by Part Retrieval and Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01999)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we decompose 3D shapes into a set of parts in an unsupervised manner, while using high-quality geometric primitives and maintaining control over the type of decomposition produced?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Retrieving and assembling parts from a user-provided 3D part library can allow unsupervised decomposition of shapes into clean geometry parts.

2) Having control over the part library will give control over the type of decomposition produced for the same input shape.

3) An iterative optimization procedure can be designed to efficiently search the combinatorial space of part retrieval and placement in order to reconstruct the input shape.

In summary, the central goal is unsupervised decomposition of 3D shapes using an input part library, with a focus on enabling control over the decomposition through the choice of parts. The method proposed is based on an optimization scheme that searches for good part selections and placements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Proposes an unsupervised framework that retrieves and poses 3D parts from a given part library to reconstruct 3D target shapes. This allows reconstructing shapes using clean, high-quality parts while still offering control over the type of decomposition through the choice of part library.

- Formulates the discrete combinatorial search problem of part retrieval as a continuous optimization problem by representing the part library on a learned latent space via a variational autoencoder.

- Presents an iterative optimization procedure with three key phases: direct part pose optimization, part segmentation and re-encoding to shift parts to uncovered regions, and borrowing part configurations from similar well-reconstructed shapes. This allows escaping local optima.

- Demonstrates reconstructing shapes using parts from different categories, enabling applications like stylized reconstruction. Also shows higher reconstruction accuracy than existing methods.

- The ability to reconstruct shapes in an unsupervised way using arbitrary reusable 3D part assets has applications in computer graphics and vision. The control over decomposition type also aids interpretation and editing of shapes.

In summary, the key innovation is an unsupervised framework for reconstructing shapes by retrieving and posing parts that combines the benefits of prior parametric and neural decomposition approaches in terms of control, accuracy, and reusability. The optimization procedure and part latent space help make this discrete combinatorial problem tractable.
