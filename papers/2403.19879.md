# [MAC: Maximizing Algebraic Connectivity for Graph Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability for autonomous robots to navigate environments over extended periods of time. However, the computational and memory requirements of SLAM algorithms scale poorly as more measurements are incorporated, making lifelong SLAM impractical. The number of edges in the measurement graph is a key determinant of the complexity of graph-based SLAM algorithms. Therefore, selecting a sparse yet informative subset of measurements (graph sparsification) is important for efficient lifelong SLAM. Most existing graph sparsification methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of the sparsified graph.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a spectral graph sparsification algorithm called MAC that maximizes the algebraic connectivity of the measurement graph while constraining the number of selected edges. Algebraic connectivity, also known as Fiedler value, is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix. It controls both the best-case and worst-case estimation accuracy in pose graph SLAM problems. Maximizing algebraic connectivity leads to better-connected sparse graphs that retain the quality of SLAM solutions. 

Since directly maximizing algebraic connectivity with a cardinality constraint is NP-hard, the paper formulates a continuous relaxation that can be efficiently solved with Frank-Wolfe optimization. The fractional solution is rounded to obtain a sparse subgraph. The duality gap of the relaxation provides a bound on the suboptimality. Hence MAC has theoretical guarantees on the quality of sparsification.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the graph sparsification problem in SLAM as maximizing algebraic connectivity subject to a budget on the number of edges (first paper to do so)
- Proposes an efficient convex relaxation technique to solve the NP-hard maximization problem 
- Introduces a computationally inexpensive Frank-Wolfe algorithm, MAC, to solve the relaxation
- Provides theoretical guarantees on the quality of sparsification using duality
- Demonstrates MAC outperforming heuristics on SLAM datasets, in quality of sparsified graphs and localization accuracy

The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions towards provably good graph sparsification for efficient lifelong SLAM. The relaxation technique and analysis provide a principled graph optimization framework for other robotics applications as well.
