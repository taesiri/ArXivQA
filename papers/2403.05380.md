# [Spectrogram-Based Detection of Auto-Tuned Vocals in Music Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of detecting auto-tuned vocals in music recordings. Auto-tuning technology corrects the pitch of vocals to make them perfectly in tune. While this can polish an imperfect vocal performance, excessive use of auto-tune has raised concerns about diminishing the authenticity and integrity of music. However, detecting the use of auto-tune, especially when only given the full recording rather than individual tracks, is challenging. No previous work has specifically tackled this problem.

Proposed Solution:
The paper puts forth a data-driven pipeline to detect auto-tuned vocals by analyzing mel-spectrograms of the audio. The pipeline has three main stages - vocal isolation from accompaniment using an existing tool, dividing audio into segments, and generating mel-spectrograms. These are fed into a triplet network to extract discriminative features, which are finally classified by a binary classifier. The novelty lies in using triplets to leverage the differences between original and auto-tuned mel-spectrograms.

Contributions:

• Creation of a new dataset with original and auto-tuned vocal samples derived from existing datasets. Includes full recordings and isolated vocals.

• Novel pipeline using triplet networks and mel-spectrogram analysis to effectively detect auto-tuning. Shows superior accuracy over RawNet2 baseline in segment-level and song-level evaluation.

• Demonstrates robustness to post-processing like MP3 compression and modifications like adding noise. Handles real-world scenarios better than baseline.

• Pioneering work focused specifically on exposing artificially corrected vocals, unlike prior work targeting mainly plagiarism detection and other manipulations.

The paper delivers a promising solution to identify auto-tuned vocals, helping preserve authenticity in music. The created dataset enables further advances in this crucial but overlooked area.
