# [Spectrogram-Based Detection of Auto-Tuned Vocals in Music Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of detecting auto-tuned vocals in music recordings. Auto-tuning technology corrects the pitch of vocals to make them perfectly in tune. While this can polish an imperfect vocal performance, excessive use of auto-tune has raised concerns about diminishing the authenticity and integrity of music. However, detecting the use of auto-tune, especially when only given the full recording rather than individual tracks, is challenging. No previous work has specifically tackled this problem.

Proposed Solution:
The paper puts forth a data-driven pipeline to detect auto-tuned vocals by analyzing mel-spectrograms of the audio. The pipeline has three main stages - vocal isolation from accompaniment using an existing tool, dividing audio into segments, and generating mel-spectrograms. These are fed into a triplet network to extract discriminative features, which are finally classified by a binary classifier. The novelty lies in using triplets to leverage the differences between original and auto-tuned mel-spectrograms.

Contributions:

• Creation of a new dataset with original and auto-tuned vocal samples derived from existing datasets. Includes full recordings and isolated vocals.

• Novel pipeline using triplet networks and mel-spectrogram analysis to effectively detect auto-tuning. Shows superior accuracy over RawNet2 baseline in segment-level and song-level evaluation.

• Demonstrates robustness to post-processing like MP3 compression and modifications like adding noise. Handles real-world scenarios better than baseline.

• Pioneering work focused specifically on exposing artificially corrected vocals, unlike prior work targeting mainly plagiarism detection and other manipulations.

The paper delivers a promising solution to identify auto-tuned vocals, helping preserve authenticity in music. The created dataset enables further advances in this crucial but overlooked area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel data-driven approach using triplet networks and mel-spectrograms to detect the use of auto-tuning for pitch correction in singing vocals within music recordings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a data-driven approach for detecting Auto-Tuned vocals in music recordings. Specifically:

- The paper proposes using triplet networks and mel-spectrograms to distinguish between authentic and Auto-Tuned singing performances. This represents the first effort specifically focused on Auto-Tune detection.

- The authors created a new dataset containing original and Auto-Tuned vocal clips to train and evaluate their models. This dataset was generated by processing existing datasets using a pitch correction method to simulate Auto-Tuning.

- Experiments demonstrate that their approach, using various CNN architectures as backbones, outperforms Rawnet2 (a state-of-the-art audio forgery detection model) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and robustness for Auto-Tune detection at both the segment and song levels.

- The study provides a pioneering benchmark and methodology for Auto-Tune detection, opening up potential future research directions in this area within the music information retrieval and music forensics domains.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a novel data-driven pipeline for spectrogram-based detection of Auto-Tuned vocals, backed by a newly created dataset, to address this previously unexplored problem.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using mel-spectrograms as input to the model. Why are mel-spectrograms suitable for highlighting subtle information in the audio signal compared to other representations? How do they help in distinguishing between Auto-Tuned and authentic vocals?

2. The paper employs a triplet network for feature extraction. What is the advantage of using a triplet network over a simple CNN architecture for this task? How does the semi-hard triplet selection method used help with model convergence?

3. The vocal isolation is performed using Vocal Remover. What are some limitations of this approach? How could a dedicated source separation model trained on vocal data potentially improve results? 

4. The paper generates a new dataset by applying pitch correction to existing datasets. What are some potential issues with the pitch correction process described? How could it be further improved to better replicate professional auto-tuning?

5. Different CNN architectures like ResNet, ResNeXt and EfficientNet are experimented with as backbones. Why is model architecture independence useful? What differences did you observe between the architectures in segment-level results?

6. Song-level classification uses a threshold on detected Auto-Tune segments. What are some better approaches for aggregating segment-level decisions to song-level decisions? How could hierarchical or sequential modeling help?

7. What additional pre-processing could help improve robustness of the models to post-processing like MP3 compression or effects? Could data augmentation be useful?

8. The paper focuses on detecting extensive auto-tuning that impacts vocal authenticity. Could the approach be extended to detect subtle auto-tuning as well? What changes would be needed?

9. What other multimedia forensics tasks could the proposed approach be useful for, with appropriate dataset changes? Any other audio/music related tasks?

10. The paper mentions the lack of manually Auto-Tuned samples as a limitation. What are some ways real Auto-Tuned samples could be collected legally and ethically for research? Could synthetic data generation be an option?
