# [Direct Acquisition Optimization for Low-Budget Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Active learning (AL) is useful for integrating data-intensive machine learning models into domains with limited labeled data. However, existing AL algorithms show diminished effectiveness when the labeling budget is extremely low (less than 1% of unlabeled data).  
- Two main categories of AL algorithms: 1) heuristic-based not optimizing for true evaluation metric (error reduction), 2) expected error reduction (EER) based optimizing for true metric but computationally expensive and relies on separate validation set.
- There is a gap between capabilities of current AL methods and demands from real-world low-budget applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Direct Acquisition Optimization (DAO), a novel AL algorithm for low-budget settings.
- DAO efficiently approximates the optimal EER formulation by:
  1) Using influence functions to update model parameters when adding new candidate samples, avoiding retraining.
  2) Introducing separate acquisition strategy on unlabeled data to enable unbiased loss estimation through bias correction, avoiding reliance on labeled validation set.
- For batch acquisitions, stochastic sampling strategies are used to handle interactions between selected points.

Main Contributions:
- Empirical analysis showing limitations of existing AL methods in low budgets.
- A new AL algorithm DAO that optimizes sample selection based on expected error reduction while being efficient through influence functions and unbiased loss estimation.
- Experiments on 7 datasets demonstrating DAO's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in low budgets, especially significantly outperforming when budget extremely small.
- Analysis of components like accuracy of influence-based model updates and effectiveness of proposed loss estimation.
