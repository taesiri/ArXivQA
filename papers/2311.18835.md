# [InstructSeq: Unifying Vision Tasks with Instruction-conditioned   Multi-modal Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18835)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces InstructSeq, a unified multi-task vision framework that can accomplish diverse tasks including segmentation, detection, and captioning based on free-form natural language instructions. It employs a multimodal transformer architecture, using a visual encoder to extract image features and a text encoder to encode instructions. An autoregressive transformer then fuses the representations to generate sequential outputs, producing either visual or text tokens tailored to different applications. By training on an expanded instruction set from a language model, InstructSeq learns to align flexible linguistic descriptions with model behaviors across tasks. It achieves strong performance rivaling specialized models on semantic segmentation, referring expression segmentation/comprehension, and image captioning without task-specific tuning. InstructSeq also demonstrates compelling generalization capabilities to novel instructions and unseen classes. Unique capabilities stem from its sampling-based prediction, allowing multiple outputs and confidence estimation. Through the flexible control and multi-task unification empowered by natural language, InstructSeq represents an advance towards more versatile and human-aligned computer vision systems.
