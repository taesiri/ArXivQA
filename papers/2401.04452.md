# [AI Competitions and Benchmarks, Practical issues: Proposals, grant   money, sponsors, prizes, dissemination, publicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper discusses the practical issues and challenges associated with organizing data science competitions and benchmarks. Key issues include: incentivizing participation, community engagement, estimating costs and resources needed, and finding sponsors/funding. 

Solutions Proposed:

Incentivizing Participation:
- Competitions allow for skill development (knowledge, communication, networking) 
- Provide cutting-edge benchmark datasets to advance state-of-the-art
- Create competitive yet collaborative environments with rewards
- Gain visibility and advance career prospects

Community Engagement: 
- Define competition specifics to target community (open vs closed participation, online vs in-person, etc)  
- Connect to conferences, workshops, journals to disseminate results
- Consider open sourcing aspects to enable reuse in academia

Costs and Resources:
- Estimate needs for platform, data costs, cloud compute, challenge design expertise
- Secure sponsors from companies, granting agencies to help fund
- Define award prizes and travel grants
- Staff for running the competition and analysis

Main Contributions:  
The paper provides practical advice and considerations around non-scientific aspects of organizing data challenges based on experience. Key tips on incentivizing participation, engaging communities, budgeting and resourcing are highlighted that competition organizers would benefit from. Specific examples of competitions and costs are also provided for reference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides practical tips and information for organizing successful data challenges and competitions. Some of the main contributions include:

- A review of different incentives that motivate participation in challenges, including skills acquisition, scientific benchmarking, awards/recognition, and recruitment opportunities. Practical tips are provided for optimizing these incentives.

- Strategies and examples for community engagement and dissemination of challenge results, including associating with conferences, publishing results, and building partnerships. 

- An overview of costs, resources, and manpower required for organizing challenges, including data preparation, platform costs, governance, prizes, etc. Includes a detailed example budget from an energy challenge.

- Advice on securing financial support and sponsors from grant agencies, companies, consortia, and other sources. 

So in summary, it offers practical guidance and advice in key areas like participation, community building, budgeting, and financing to help organize effective and successful data challenges and competitions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, I would list the following as the main keywords or key terms:

- communication
- proposal
- sponsors
- practical issues
- incentives
- community engagement  
- costs
- resources
- man power
- dissemination
- publicity

The paper covers practical aspects of organizing challenges and competitions, including how to incentivize participation, engage the research community, estimate costs and acquire funding, manage human resources, and disseminate the results. Key topics revolve around communication, proposals, sponsors, costs, resources, manpower, publicity, and community building.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses various incentives for participating in challenges, including skills acquisition, scientific benchmarking, environment/awards, visibility/careers, etc. Which of these incentives do you think is most important and why? 

2. The paper proposes several strategies for community engagement when organizing a challenge. Which strategy do you think is most critical and how would you recommend implementing it effectively?

3. The section on costs outlines many different expense categories when organizing a challenge. In your view, which is the most difficult cost component to estimate accurately and how might organizers mitigate this?

4. The paper recommends bringing together an expert steering committee when organizing a challenge. What criteria would you propose for selecting the members of this committee and what would be their key responsibilities? 

5. The paper discusses the tradeoffs between computational requirements and allowing code submissions. How would you recommend challenge organizers evaluate and plan for computational resources needed?

6. What options would you propose for challenge organizers to reduce overall costs related to data generation, access, and curation? How might these impact the quality of the competition?

7. The paper recommends connecting with journal editors to discuss potential publication of competition results. What factors influence whether journal editors would be interested in this and how would you approach them effectively?

8. What criteria would you propose for determining an optimal number of participants in a challenge? How might this depend on the specific goals of the competition? 

9. The paper outlines that challenge dissemination strategy should match the question “how would it serve the targeted community?”. How might dissemination strategies differ if the community is academics vs. industry practitioners? 

10. The paper states that good data relies on synchronizing with efforts around technical standardization and ethical data sharing principles. How might adherence to principles like FAIR impact the dataset design and challenge organization?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides practical advice on key aspects of organizing successful data challenges, including incentivizing participation, community engagement, estimating costs and resources, and obtaining financial support.
