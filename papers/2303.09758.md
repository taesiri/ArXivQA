# [Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How can non-local structured information be effectively leveraged to improve multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction, particularly in low-textured regions?The authors propose a new method called "Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS)" to address this question. The key ideas/components include:- Using a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) for hypothesis propagation that adapts the sampling size and avoids getting stuck in local optima. - Constructing planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. - A hierarchical framework that mines priors at multiple scales, balancing reconstruction of details and low-texture regions.The central hypothesis seems to be that by mining non-local information in these ways, their method can achieve better MVS reconstruction compared to prior arts, especially in challenging low-texture areas. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by testing HPM-MVS on standard MVS benchmarks.In summary, the paper focuses on improving MVS reconstruction via effective use of non-local structured information, with a proposed HPM-MVS method that has several novel components to achieve this goal. The experiments then aim to demonstrate the superior performance of their approach.
