# [Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: 

How can non-local structured information be effectively leveraged to improve multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction, particularly in low-textured regions?

The authors propose a new method called "Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS)" to address this question. The key ideas/components include:

- Using a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) for hypothesis propagation that adapts the sampling size and avoids getting stuck in local optima. 

- Constructing planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. 

- A hierarchical framework that mines priors at multiple scales, balancing reconstruction of details and low-texture regions.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by mining non-local information in these ways, their method can achieve better MVS reconstruction compared to prior arts, especially in challenging low-texture areas. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by testing HPM-MVS on standard MVS benchmarks.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving MVS reconstruction via effective use of non-local structured information, with a proposed HPM-MVS method that has several novel components to achieve this goal. The experiments then aim to demonstrate the superior performance of their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS) for multi-view stereo (MVS) 3D reconstruction. The main contributions are:

1. A Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) module that adaptively samples hypotheses from neighboring pixels while avoiding getting stuck in local optima. This helps propagate good hypotheses to reconstruction challenging areas. 

2. A new way to construct planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. This creates more robust and comprehensive planar priors.

3. A hierarchical prior mining framework that constructs planar priors at multiple scales in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows exploiting non-local information and balancing reconstruction of details and low-textured regions.

4. Extensive experiments showing the proposed method outperforms previous methods on standard MVS datasets like ETH3D and Tanks & Temples. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components and the strong generalization ability of the method without needing training data.

In summary, the key novelty is using non-local information and hierarchical priors to improve MVS reconstruction, especially in challenging low-textured areas. The proposed sampling pattern, planar prior construction, and mining framework are shown to enhance performance and generalization across datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS) to improve 3D reconstruction from images, using techniques like a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern, planar prior model construction with K-Nearest Neighbors, and mining prior information at multiple scales.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-view stereo reconstruction:

- This paper focuses on improving depth estimation in low-textured regions, which is a common challenge in MVS. It proposes several novel techniques for this, including a non-local extensible sampling pattern, planar prior construction using kNN, and hierarchical prior mining.

- Compared to other PatchMatch MVS methods like Gipuma, ACMM, and ACMMP, this paper puts more emphasis on leveraging non-local information. The non-local sampling and hierarchical prior mining allow using contextual cues beyond just the local neighborhood to aid reconstruction.

- The proposed hierarchical prior mining framework is unique compared to prior work. Constructing planar priors at multiple scales provides complementary information on smooth surfaces and details. This is a clever way to balance reconstruction across the image.

- The paper compares well against state-of-the-art traditional MVS techniques like ACMMP and learning-based methods like IterMVS and MVSTER. The results show improved completeness and robustness, especially in challenging datasets like Tanks & Temples.

- The ablation studies provide good analysis of the contribution of each component. The results demonstrate the value of the non-local sampling, extensible pattern, and hierarchical mining strategies proposed.

- The approach does not require any training data, in contrast to learning-based MVS methods. The consistently strong results highlight its generalization ability to novel scenes.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in traditional MVS by creatively incorporating non-local information and multi-scale priors. The gains over existing methods are well analyzed. The ideas could provide inspiration for further work in reconstructing complex low-textured regions.
