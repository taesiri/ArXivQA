# [Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: 

How can non-local structured information be effectively leveraged to improve multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction, particularly in low-textured regions?

The authors propose a new method called "Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS)" to address this question. The key ideas/components include:

- Using a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) for hypothesis propagation that adapts the sampling size and avoids getting stuck in local optima. 

- Constructing planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. 

- A hierarchical framework that mines priors at multiple scales, balancing reconstruction of details and low-texture regions.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by mining non-local information in these ways, their method can achieve better MVS reconstruction compared to prior arts, especially in challenging low-texture areas. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by testing HPM-MVS on standard MVS benchmarks.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving MVS reconstruction via effective use of non-local structured information, with a proposed HPM-MVS method that has several novel components to achieve this goal. The experiments then aim to demonstrate the superior performance of their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS) for multi-view stereo (MVS) 3D reconstruction. The main contributions are:

1. A Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) module that adaptively samples hypotheses from neighboring pixels while avoiding getting stuck in local optima. This helps propagate good hypotheses to reconstruction challenging areas. 

2. A new way to construct planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. This creates more robust and comprehensive planar priors.

3. A hierarchical prior mining framework that constructs planar priors at multiple scales in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows exploiting non-local information and balancing reconstruction of details and low-textured regions.

4. Extensive experiments showing the proposed method outperforms previous methods on standard MVS datasets like ETH3D and Tanks & Temples. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components and the strong generalization ability of the method without needing training data.

In summary, the key novelty is using non-local information and hierarchical priors to improve MVS reconstruction, especially in challenging low-textured areas. The proposed sampling pattern, planar prior construction, and mining framework are shown to enhance performance and generalization across datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS) to improve 3D reconstruction from images, using techniques like a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern, planar prior model construction with K-Nearest Neighbors, and mining prior information at multiple scales.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-view stereo reconstruction:

- This paper focuses on improving depth estimation in low-textured regions, which is a common challenge in MVS. It proposes several novel techniques for this, including a non-local extensible sampling pattern, planar prior construction using kNN, and hierarchical prior mining.

- Compared to other PatchMatch MVS methods like Gipuma, ACMM, and ACMMP, this paper puts more emphasis on leveraging non-local information. The non-local sampling and hierarchical prior mining allow using contextual cues beyond just the local neighborhood to aid reconstruction.

- The proposed hierarchical prior mining framework is unique compared to prior work. Constructing planar priors at multiple scales provides complementary information on smooth surfaces and details. This is a clever way to balance reconstruction across the image.

- The paper compares well against state-of-the-art traditional MVS techniques like ACMMP and learning-based methods like IterMVS and MVSTER. The results show improved completeness and robustness, especially in challenging datasets like Tanks & Temples.

- The ablation studies provide good analysis of the contribution of each component. The results demonstrate the value of the non-local sampling, extensible pattern, and hierarchical mining strategies proposed.

- The approach does not require any training data, in contrast to learning-based MVS methods. The consistently strong results highlight its generalization ability to novel scenes.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in traditional MVS by creatively incorporating non-local information and multi-scale priors. The gains over existing methods are well analyzed. The ideas could provide inspiration for further work in reconstructing complex low-textured regions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Combining their method with a probabilistic graphical model to further improve the handling of detail and low-texture region reconstruction. The authors mention they plan to explore this direction in the future.

- Applying and evaluating their method on more complex real-world datasets. The authors demonstrate good results on the ETH3D and Tanks & Temples datasets, but suggest testing on more challenging real-world data could be beneficial.

- Exploring the integration and joint optimization of their hierarchical prior mining framework with learning-based methods. The authors note the recent success of learning-based MVS methods, and propose exploring ways to combine the strengths of their approach with deep learning techniques.

- Generalizing the framework to other MVS pipelines beyond PatchMatch. The authors show their NESP module can boost other MVS methods and suggest exploring adapting the hierarchical mining framework to other MVS pipelines as well.

- Studying how to efficiently adapt the number of hierarchical prior scales according to scene properties. The authors use a fixed number of scales currently - investigating adaptive or optimal scale selection could improve results.

- Validating the approach on dynamic scenes and investigating extensions for non-rigid reconstruction. The current method focuses on static scenes - applying to dynamic scenes could be an interesting direction.

In summary, the key suggestions are leveraging probabilistic graphical models, integrating with learning-based techniques, generalizing across MVS pipelines and scenes, and adapting components like prior scales or applying to dynamic data. Testing on more complex real-world data is also highlighted.
