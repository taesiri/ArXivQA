# [Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: 

How can non-local structured information be effectively leveraged to improve multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction, particularly in low-textured regions?

The authors propose a new method called "Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS)" to address this question. The key ideas/components include:

- Using a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) for hypothesis propagation that adapts the sampling size and avoids getting stuck in local optima. 

- Constructing planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. 

- A hierarchical framework that mines priors at multiple scales, balancing reconstruction of details and low-texture regions.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by mining non-local information in these ways, their method can achieve better MVS reconstruction compared to prior arts, especially in challenging low-texture areas. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by testing HPM-MVS on standard MVS benchmarks.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving MVS reconstruction via effective use of non-local structured information, with a proposed HPM-MVS method that has several novel components to achieve this goal. The experiments then aim to demonstrate the superior performance of their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS) for multi-view stereo (MVS) 3D reconstruction. The main contributions are:

1. A Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) module that adaptively samples hypotheses from neighboring pixels while avoiding getting stuck in local optima. This helps propagate good hypotheses to reconstruction challenging areas. 

2. A new way to construct planar prior models using k-nearest neighbors to find reliable points, even in marginal areas where prior construction is difficult. This creates more robust and comprehensive planar priors.

3. A hierarchical prior mining framework that constructs planar priors at multiple scales in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows exploiting non-local information and balancing reconstruction of details and low-textured regions.

4. Extensive experiments showing the proposed method outperforms previous methods on standard MVS datasets like ETH3D and Tanks & Temples. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components and the strong generalization ability of the method without needing training data.

In summary, the key novelty is using non-local information and hierarchical priors to improve MVS reconstruction, especially in challenging low-textured areas. The proposed sampling pattern, planar prior construction, and mining framework are shown to enhance performance and generalization across datasets.
