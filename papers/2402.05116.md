# [Quantifying Similarity: Text-Mining Approaches to Evaluate ChatGPT and   Google Bard Content in Relation to BioMedical Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The emergence of AI generative tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard can produce impressive content, but assessing usefulness and similarity to real scientific literature is an open research question.  

Objectives
- Use prompt engineering to generate clinical content from ChatGPT and Google Bard related to "prostate cancer treatment." 
- Assess similarities of generated content to real biomedical literature using text mining and network analysis approaches.

Methods
- Prompt engineered ChatGPT and Google Bard to create simulated real-world abstracts on prostate cancer treatment. 
- Compared generated abstracts to 10,000 PubMed abstracts on same topic using:
  - Document similarity metrics (cosine, Jaccard)
  - Bigram frequency analysis via TF-IDF
  - Network centrality analysis of bigram networks

Results  
- ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in:
  - Cosine similarity (38% vs 34%)
  - Jaccard similarity (23% vs 19%) 
  - TF-IDF bigram similarity (47% vs 41%)
  - Degree/closeness centrality in networks
- ChatGPT networks had novel bigrams not in literature networks

Conclusions
- ChatGPT exhibits higher similarity to real literature vs. Google Bard
- ChatGPT connects terms in ways that could inspire new clinical questions and hypotheses
- More analysis needed across diseases/tools to further validate findings

In summary, the paper presents a quantitative analysis showing ChatGPT generates content more similar to real biomedical literature than Google Bard. The findings suggest prompt engineering ChatGPT could provide value for clinical applications by inspiring new lines of questioning and discovery.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents an exploratory analysis using text mining and network analysis to evaluate the similarity and closeness of content generated by ChatGPT and Google Bard to real biomedical literature on prostate cancer treatment, finding ChatGPT to have higher similarity in documents, bigrams, and network centrality measures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is using text mining and network analysis approaches to quantify and compare the similarity between content generated by AI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard to real biomedical literature from PubMed related to prostate cancer treatment. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Performs prompt engineering to generate 100 abstract-like documents from ChatGPT and Google Bard on the topic of "prostate cancer treatment"
- Compares these AI-generated documents to 10,000 real abstracts from PubMed using similarity metrics like cosine, Jaccard, and TF-IDF to measure closeness
- Analyzes similarity in bigram networks between the corpora using degree and closeness centrality 
- Finds that ChatGPT exhibits higher similarity to the PubMed articles than Google Bard over various metrics, suggesting it may be better for generating useful clinical questions and hypotheses

So in summary, the key contribution is a quantitative analysis framework and initial results comparing the content quality and clinical relevance of state-of-the-art AI models to real biomedical literature. The findings suggest the potential for using these models to augment clinical decision support systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses prompt engineering to generate simulated real-world data from ChatGPT and Google Bard. What are some ways the prompt could be improved to generate higher quality or more relevant abstracts on prostate cancer treatment? Could a multi-step prompting strategy be more effective?

2. The document similarity analysis relies on cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity metrics. What are some other similarity metrics that could be tested, such as semantic similarity using word embeddings, to further validate the results? 

3. The bigram frequency analysis uses a basic TF-IDF approach. Could more advanced NLP methods like topic modeling or embedding-based similarity yield additional insights when analyzing the bigrams? How might the results change?

4. Network analysis is performed on bigram networks using centrality measures. What other network science techniques could be applied to compare the structure and topology of the different bigram graphs? How might measures like modularity, connectivity, or motifs reveal new insights?

5. Only abstract-level text is used in the analysis. How might expanding the analysis to include full body text change or enhance the results and comparisons between real and generated data? Would new patterns emerge?

6. The analysis relies entirely on text features. How could incorporating metadata like authors, journals, dates etc. expand the similarity analysis between the real and generated abstracts? Might new techniques be required?

7. Only 100 generated abstracts are used from ChatGPT and Google Bard. How would results change by using thousands or more generated records for comparison against the 10000 PubMed records. Would similarities increase?

8. The analysis is limited to a single search query in PubMed. How can testing across multiple diseases and search queries improve generalizability of the results and comparison between real literature and AI-generated text?

9. Could more advanced generative AI techniques like sampling or beam search during prompt engineering further optimize the quality and relevance of the simulated abstracts used in the analysis? What benefits might this provide?  

10. The analysis aims to quantify similarity in an unbiased way, but ultimately is there utility in having clinicians qualitatively evaluate a sample of the generated text? Would this reveal new insights on usefulness for clinical decision support?
