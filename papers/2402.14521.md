# [Malaysian English News Decoded: A Linguistic Resource for Named Entity   and Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14521)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard English and Malaysian English (ME) exhibit differences in morphosyntax and semantics, posing challenges for NLP tasks on ME text. 
- Existing NLP datasets are inadequate as they are mainly based on Standard English. 
- Experiments showed state-of-the-art NER solutions fail to handle variations in ME, achieving F1 scores <0.6 on ME news articles.
- No annotated dataset exists to improve NER for ME.

Proposed Solution:
- Constructed a new dataset called Malaysian English News (MEN) dataset containing 200 manually annotated ME news articles.
- Annotated entities based on OntoNotes 5.0 labels + 2 new labels "TITLE" and "ROLE" to capture ME adaptations.
- Annotated relations based on DocRED and ACE-2005 labels.
- Ensured quality via inter-annotator agreement analysis and adjudication.
- Final dataset has 6,061 entities and 3,268 relation instances.
- Fine-tuned spaCy NER model on MEN dataset.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive annotated dataset specifically for Malaysian English news text.
- Captures key morphological and syntactic adaptations in ME.
- Can be used to improve NER, relation extraction and other NLP tasks for ME.  
- Fine-tuning on dataset significantly boosts spaCy NER performance on ME text.
- spacy-blank model achieved highest F1 score of 0.94 after fine-tuning.
- On average, fine-tuned models showed +230% F1 score improvement.
- Dataset and guidelines published to facilitate future ME NLP research.

In summary, the paper presented the creation of a new annotated resource to address limitations of existing English NLP solutions on Malaysian English text. The dataset and experiments demonstrate improved ability to handle Malaysian English after specialization on the target text genre and language variations.
