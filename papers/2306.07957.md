# [Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07957)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

What are the key factors behind the recent rapid progress in end-to-end driving models on the CARLA simulator, and can we identify any hidden biases or limitations in current state-of-the-art methods?

The authors note that end-to-end driving models have improved dramatically on the CARLA leaderboard benchmark in the last few years. However, it is unclear exactly why these models work so well, as different submissions vary significantly in their methods and training datasets. 

Through a series of controlled experiments and analyses, the authors identify two key "hidden biases" that they argue have been critical to the progress on CARLA but also bring certain drawbacks:

1) A strong inductive bias towards following target points that aids recovery but can cause shortcuts/failures in some cases. 

2) Ambiguous waypoint predictions that average over multimodal futures but help models brake appropriately.

By surfacing these biases and developing principled improvements, the authors propose a simplified model TF++ that sets a new state-of-the-art on two CARLA benchmarks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that making explicit and improving upon the identified hidden biases in existing end-to-end driving models will lead to better performance. The controlled experiments are aimed at testing this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying two common biases in recent state-of-the-art end-to-end driving models trained with imitation learning on CARLA:

- A bias towards following nearby target points, which helps the models recover from errors but can also cause harmful shortcut behaviors. 

- Ambiguity in waypoint predictions leading to velocity interpolation between modes.

2. Analyzing these biases through controlled experiments and proposing alternatives:

- Using a transformer decoder architecture instead of global average pooling to mitigate target point biases.

- Disentangling the path and velocity predictions to handle waypoint ambiguity.

3. Incorporating these insights to develop TransFuser++, a simplified model that achieves state-of-the-art results on the Longest6 and LAV benchmarks for CARLA.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying and analyzing common hidden biases in recent driving models, and using this analysis to develop improved methods with stronger justification. The controlled experimental approach provides insights into good practices for end-to-end driving systems.
