# [Large Language Models are Geographically Biased](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02680)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) inherently contain biases from their training data, which can lead to societal harms if unchecked. Prior work has studied biases in professions, gender, race etc. but geographic bias is a new dimension that allows inclusively evaluating biases of all people on Earth. 

- Geographic bias is defined as systemic errors made by LLMs when making geospatial predictions. It allows attributing biases to groups based on where they live and examining correlations with potential anchoring bias distributions like socioeconomic conditions.

Methods
- The authors design prompts to elicit accurate zero-shot geospatial predictions from LLMs in the form of ratings on a scale of 0.0 to 9.9. This avoids fine-tuning biases. 

- They visualize predictions on maps to analyze errors and biases. Plots of rating ranks are preferred over ratings themselves since ranks are more robust. 

- For sensitive subjective topics with no ground truth, a bias score is proposed that incorporates correlation with an anchoring bias distribution, mean absolute deviation (MAD) of ratings, and answer rate.

Key Results
- LLMs can make accurate zero-shot geospatial predictions, with Spearman's rho up to 0.89 for some topics. Using expected rating values with logprobs improves performance.

- Common geographic biases exist for both objective and sensitive subjective topics. In particular, LLMs rate locations with lower socioeconomic status lower on sensitive subjective qualities, with high correlation (Spearman's rho up to 0.7)

- Subtle biases can be revealed using expected rating values, even when MAD of ratings appears very small. Bias score quantifies magnitude of bias and varies significantly across LLMs.

Main Contributions
- Demonstrating LLMs' capability for accurate zero-shot geospatial predictions 

- Discovering and visualizing geographic biases of LLMs, especially discrimination against lower socioeconomic areas

- Proposing bias score to quantify magnitude of geographic bias to compare models


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates that large language models exhibit systemic errors in their geospatial predictions that discriminate against areas with lower socioeconomic conditions across both objective and sensitive subjective topics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is threefold:

1) Demonstrating that large language models (LLMs) are capable of making accurate zero-shot geospatial predictions. Their ratings show strong monotonic correlation with ground truth data. 

2) Discovering that LLMs exhibit geographic biases, especially against areas with lower socioeconomic conditions, on a range of objective and sensitive subjective topics. For example, residents in Africa are consistently rated as less attractive than residents in Europe.

3) Proposing a metric to quantify the magnitude of geographic bias in LLMs. This incorporates the mean absolute deviation of ratings as well as the correlation with an anchoring bias distribution like infant mortality rate. The authors find significant variance in bias across existing LLMs based on this metric.

In summary, the paper introduces the concept of geographic bias in LLMs, shows evidence this type of bias exists, and provides a way to measure it across models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Geographic bias
- Systemic errors 
- Geospatial predictions
- Social biases
- Group fairness 
- Spearman's rank correlation
- Infant mortality rate
- Socioeconomic conditions
- Sensitive subjective topics
- Attractiveness, morality, intelligence 
- Mean absolute deviation (MAD)
- Log probabilities (logprobs)

The paper introduces the concept of geographic bias in LLMs, defined as systemic errors in their geospatial predictions. It shows that LLMs exhibit biases correlated with socioeconomic status when making predictions about sensitive subjective attributes like attractiveness across geographic regions. The analysis relies on metrics like Spearman's rank correlation and mean absolute deviation, and uses log probabilities to reveal subtle biases. Overall, the key focus is on evaluating and quantifying the geographic biases inherent in current LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new notion of "geographic bias". How does this concept of bias differ from previous definitions of bias studied in NLP literature? What novel kinds of biases can be examined through a geographic lens?

2. The authors claim that assessing bias through geography is powerful because many aspects of human life are projected onto geographic space. Can you expand on some of the key attributes that geography encodes (e.g. culture, race)? Why does this make a geographic framing useful?  

3. The prompts designed to elicit zero-shot geospatial predictions from LLMs consist of both a task description prefix and a spatial context component. Can you discuss the purpose of each of these components and why they need to be combined?

4. The authors use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ rather than Pearson's r to measure model performance. What are the key benefits of using rank correlation for evaluating these geographic predictions? When would Pearson's r be more appropriate?

5. For subjective topics, a higher mean absolute deviation (MAD) of ratings is claimed to be inappropriate. Explain why large deviations in ratings are problematic for sensitive subjective topics specifically. What assumptions does this rely on?

6. The bias score incorporates Spearman's ρ, MAD of ratings, and answer rate. Walk through each component and discuss why it is included and what aspect of bias it targets. How could the formulation be improved?

7. The visualization of mean rank error surfaces systemic misestimations in objective topic predictions. Provide some examples of insights that can be gained from these spatial error patterns and how they could be interpreted. 

8. Log probability ratings revealed subtle biases even when MAD of ratings was extremely small. Why are logprobs more sensitive for detecting bias? What are some of the limitations?

9. Infant survival rate was found to be the best predictor of bias over other socioeconomic proxy variables. What explanations could account for this result? How was this conclusion reached?

10. The authors claim LLMs exhibit similar geographic biases. However, the bias score results showed significant variation. Discuss possible reasons certain models appear more biased. What factors might contribute to differences?
