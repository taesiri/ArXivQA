# [Augment before You Try: Knowledge-Enhanced Table Question Answering via   Table Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15555)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Table question answering is an important task that tests a model's ability to understand and reason over structured data in tables. However, the given table often lacks necessary information to answer the question, requiring the integration of external knowledge. Existing methods either convert the table into text which removes its structured format, or embed knowledge queries directly in SQL statements, which increases chances of syntax errors.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a simple yet effective pipeline to augment the given table with external knowledge before generating the SQL query. It first analyzes the question to determine missing information. It then queries an external knowledge source, organizes results into a table, and joins this table with the original one. Finally, it generates a SQL query on the augmented table to answer the question.  

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel augment-then-generate pipeline that preserves structure of tables while seamlessly integrating external knowledge.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 table QA datasets requiring different knowledge sources. Outperforms methods that linearize tables and significantly reduces syntax errors compared to those embedding knowledge queries in SQL.
- Demonstrates particular improvements on complex questions involving large tables or multiple table operations. Also easier to inspect and correct errors.
- Provides detailed analysis and examples explaining benefits over existing approaches.

In summary, the paper presents a simple yet very effective approach for incorporating external knowledge into table QA, with empirical evidence showing improved performance and interpretability over previous methods. The main advantage lies in augmenting tables before generating standard SQL queries, eliminating complications from knowledge integration directly in symbolic execution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method for table question answering that first augments the given table with additional information extracted from an external source, and then generates a SQL query over the original and augmented tables to answer the question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a simple yet effective method for integrating external knowledge with a given table to answer questions. The key ideas are:

1) Analyze the question and table to determine what additional information is needed to answer the question. Query external knowledge sources to obtain this information.

2) Organize the obtained information into a separate augmenting table that complements the original table. 

3) Generate a SQL query over the original and augmenting tables to answer the question. 

The paper shows that this augment-then-generate pipeline outperforms methods that convert tables to text or embed knowledge queries in SQL statements. It eliminates the need to put knowledge queries in SQL, while preserving the structured table format. Experiments on three table QA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple and modular pipeline to augment tables with external knowledge before generating SQL queries to answer questions. This is shown to outperform previous approaches.

The paper proposes a method to augment a given table with additional information from external sources before generating a SQL query to answer natural language questions. It evaluates the approach on table QA datasets like WikiTQ, TATQA, and FinQA, and compares with prior methods like Program-of-Thought and Binder that also combine symbolic execution with LLMs. Metrics used include exact match rate between predicted and ground truth answers. Overall, the key focus is on improving table QA by better integrating external knowledge while retaining the structured table format.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims the proposed method is simple yet effective. What are some potential drawbacks or limitations of this simplicity? For example, could the simplicity reduce flexibility or generalizability? 

2. How does the performance of the method scale when integrating knowledge from multiple heterogeneous sources compared to a single source? What adjustments would be needed?

3. One advantage mentioned is easier error inspection and correction. But doesn't constructing an additional table also introduce new potential errors? How can these errors be efficiently detected and corrected?

4. Could the proposed pipeline be extended to incrementally construct multiple augmenting tables? What mechanisms could enable iterative augmentation and refinement of tables? 

5. The method relies heavily on the LLM's ability to generate valid SQL queries. How brittle is the approach to limitations in the LLM's database query capabilities?

6. For closed-domain data, could the pipeline be modified to jointly analyze the table, document, and question to directly extract only missing information instead of requiring multiple stages?

7. What types of questions or tables would be particularly challenging for the proposed approach? When would it break down?

8. How does the performance compare when using a more conversational LLM architecture like LLM-assisted SQL generation instead of prompting a single large LLM?

9. Could the table augmentation approach integrate probabilistic knowledge or handle uncertainty in the external knowledge source? How would the pipeline change?

10. The evaluation focuses on question answering. How would the method need to be adapted for table-based dialog, clarification, or conversational QA scenarios?
