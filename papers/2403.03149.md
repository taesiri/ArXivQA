# [Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Training Data   Distribution Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03149)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to client-side training data distribution inference attacks where a malicious client can reconstruct images similar to those in a victim client's private training data. Existing defense mechanisms like differential privacy and Byzantine-robust aggregation rules provide some protection but are still vulnerable in certain attack scenarios. There is a need for a more robust defense mechanism.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes InferGuard, a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation rule to defend against client-side training data distribution inference attacks in FL. 

Key ideas:
- Server calculates coordinate-wise median of all client model updates 
- Model updates that deviate significantly from the median are considered malicious
- Non-malicious model updates are averaged to get final update

Main Contributions:
- Identified limitations of existing defenses against client-side attacks
- Proposed InferGuard, a new aggregation rule robust to such attacks 
- Evaluated on 5 datasets - MNIST, FashionMNIST, AT&T, SVHN, GTSRB
- Compared with 10 baselines including aggregation rules and other defenses
- Showed InferGuard effectively defends against attacks even adaptive attacks
- Significantly outperforms baselines on image reconstruction quality metrics 

In summary, the paper identified vulnerabilities in existing FL defenses against training data inference attacks, and proposed a novel robust aggregation rule InferGuard that leverages coordinate-wise median to identify malicious updates. Extensive evaluations demonstrate InferGuard's effectiveness over prior defenses.
