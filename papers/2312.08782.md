# [Toward General-Purpose Robots via Foundation Models: A Survey and   Meta-Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08782)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of using foundation models for robotics. It categorizes approaches into two main areas: applying existing vision and language foundation models to robotics tasks, and developing robotics-specific foundation models trained on robot data. The paper summarizes how both types of models are being used across core robot capabilities like perception, planning, and control. It highlights promising capabilities like few-shot generalization but also notes limitations around model grounding, safety, reproducibility, and real-world validation. Remaining challenges are discussed including better grounding to physical embodiment, improving safety and uncertainty quantification, developing more standardized benchmarks, and issues around continual learning and model updating. Promising future directions are outlined such as research into robotics-oriented world models that incorporate strong priors and semantics. Overall, the survey charts an exciting new research area but notes foundational models have substantial room for improvement before fully delivering on promises around generalist robotic systems.
