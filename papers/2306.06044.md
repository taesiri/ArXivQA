# [GANeRF: Leveraging Discriminators to Optimize Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06044)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can generative adversarial networks (GANs) be leveraged to improve the realism and quality of novel view synthesis from neural radiance fields (NeRFs)? The key hypothesis is that by incorporating an adversarial loss from a 2D patch discriminator into the NeRF optimization, this will impose additional multi-view rendering constraints that can help address common artifacts and imperfections. The discriminator learns the distribution of real image patches from the scene, and by optimizing the NeRF to fool this discriminator, it should generate more realistic and natural looking renderings.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using adversarial training with a patch GAN can help optimize the underlying 3D radiance field representation to be more photorealistic and improve novel view synthesis, especially in areas with limited image observations.
