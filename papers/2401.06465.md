# [Sanity Checks Revisited: An Exploration to Repair the Model Parameter   Randomisation Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The Model Parameter Randomisation Test (MPRT) is a popular method in eXplainable AI (XAI) for evaluating the quality of explanation methods. It measures how much an explanation changes when the model parameters are progressively randomized. However, recent works have identified several issues with MPRT:

(1) The preprocessing of taking absolute values of attributions may erase meaningful information about feature importance. 

(2) Randomizing layers top-down may preserve properties of lower layers in the forward pass, limiting the degree explanations can change.  

(3) The pairwise similarity measures used are sensitive to noise (e.g. gradient shattering), biasing evaluations towards noisier methods.

Proposed Solutions:
To address these issues, the authors propose two MPRT variants:

1. Smooth MPRT (sMPRT): Adds a "denoising" step by averaging explanations over multiple noisy input samples before evaluation. Aims to reduce sensitivity to gradient shattering noise.

2. Efficient MPRT (eMPRT): Instead of progressive layer-wise comparison, it measures the relative rise in explanation complexity from fully randomizing the model parameters. Avoids issues with layer order and biased similarity measures.

Contributions:

- Identify and analyze key issues with the prevalent MPRT metric 

- Introduce sMPRT to reduce noise sensitivity through input perturbation and aggregation

- Propose eMPRT to quantify change in complexity, avoiding layer order effects and biased similarities

- Demonstrate improved reliability of both variants over MPRT via benchmarking

- Highlight that no single metric is perfect; careful, contextual application of evaluations is vital

The improved MPRT variants can enable more trustworthy quantitative evaluation of explanation methods in XAI. However, further analysis and development of robust metrics remains an open challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two variants of the Model Parameter Randomisation Test (Smooth MPRT and Efficient MPRT) to address issues with the original MPRT's sensitivity to noise and layer randomisation order, demonstrating improved reliability in evaluating explanation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two variants of the Model Parameter Randomisation Test (MPRT) for evaluating explainable AI methods:

1. Smooth MPRT (sMPRT): This adds a "denoising" preprocessing step to MPRT where explanations are averaged over multiple perturbed inputs. The goal is to reduce the impact of noise and gradient shattering on the evaluation results.

2. Efficient MPRT (eMPRT): This variant removes the layer-by-layer comparison between original and randomized explanations. Instead, it compares the rise in complexity of explanations before and after full model randomization. This avoids issues with layer randomization order and biased similarity measurements.

The paper shows through experiments that these variants lead to more reliable evaluations compared to the original MPRT, making them useful additions to the toolbox of XAI evaluation metrics. The overall goal is to enable more trustworthy applications of explanation methods by developing sound quantitative evaluation approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The smooth MPRT (sMPRT) introduces a "denoising" step by averaging attributions over N perturbed inputs. What is the motivation behind this? How does it help address the issues with the original MPRT? What are some of the drawbacks of this approach?

2. The efficient MPRT (eMPRT) replaces the layer-wise parameter randomization and similarity measurement with a single comparison of explanation complexity before and after full model randomization. Why is comparing explanations only after full randomization advantageous? How exactly does eMPRT quantify the rise in complexity?

3. The paper proposes using histogram entropy to measure the complexity of explanations in eMPRT. What are the specific advantages of using histogram entropy over other potential complexity measures? How is the number of bins determined and how does this impact results?

4. The meta-evaluation results demonstrate superior performance for eMPRT and sMPRT over original MPRT. Why do you think this is the case? What specific properties lead to increased reliability? Are there still shortcomings?

5. Figure 3 shows considerable variability in explanation rankings between eMPRT and MPRT. What does this suggest about evaluating explanation methods? Should multiple quantitative metrics be used?

6. The paper advocates for a contextualized rather than monolithic adoption of metrics in XAI evaluation. What is meant by this? In what scenarios might MPRT variants be more or less appropriate? 

7. How might layer randomization order in MPRT impact results, as discussed in the Supplement? What are the tradeoffs between top-down and bottom-up randomization?

8. For sMPRT, how is the noise level determined? What is the impact of the number of noise samples N on results? What practical considerations influence choice of N?

9. The complexity measure used in eMPRT relies on binning attribution values. How should the number of bins be determined? How might this depend on characteristics of the data domain?

10. How do you think sMPRT and eMPRT could be further improved or built upon in future work? Could they be combined and what would be the advantages? How else might issues with the original MPRT be addressed?
