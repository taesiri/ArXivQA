# [Adaptive LiDAR-Radar Fusion for Outdoor Odometry Across Dense Smoke   Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Robust odometry estimation in adverse environments with degraded perception, such as dense smoke, remains a key challenge in robotics. LiDARs suffer from degraded perception in such environments due to the short wavelength of the sensors. On the other hand, radars show promising robustness due to their longer wavelengths. Hence, fusing LiDAR and radar provides an opportunity for robust odometry estimation across dense smoke conditions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an adaptive LiDAR-radar fusion method that utilizes radar point clouds as an alternative modality when LiDAR point clouds get corrupted in dense smoke. The method has three main stages:

1. Radar Point Cloud Preprocessing: The 4D radar measurements (3D position + Doppler velocity) are used to distinguish static and dynamic points. 

2. LiDAR Degenerated Area Detection: By comparing radar's static points with LiDAR points, regions of LiDAR degradation are identified based on differences in spatial information.

3. Removing Dynamic Points in LiDAR: Leveraging the dynamic points from radar, corresponding dynamic points are removed from LiDAR to retain only the static structure.

If LiDAR degradation is detected, radar's static points are utilized. Otherwise, LiDAR's static points are used as input for odometry estimation using an existing LiDAR-inertial odometry method.

Main Contributions:

- Enables reliable odometry estimation by fusing LiDAR and radar in dense smoke environments through adaptive sensor selection

- Can appropriately identify regions of LiDAR perceptual degradation in dense smoke

- Demonstrates successful elimination of dynamic points from LiDAR leveraging radar's Doppler measurements  

- Provides experimental validation on real-world datasets that verifies improved robustness over using individual LiDAR or radar odometry

In summary, the paper presents an adaptive sensor fusion approach that leverages the complementary strengths of LiDAR and radar to achieve robust ego-motion estimation across dense smoke conditions where LiDARs suffer from perceptual degradation.
