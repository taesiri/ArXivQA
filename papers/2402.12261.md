# [NEO-BENCH: Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models with   Neologisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12261)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with language change over time, specifically the emergence of neologisms - new words representing new concepts or meanings. 
- Adding just one neologism to a sentence halves machine translation performance on average based on a human evaluation.
- Current automatic evaluation metrics for machine translation do not accurately measure performance on sentences with neologisms.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Neo-Bench, a new benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and process neologisms.
- Neo-Bench contains 2,505 English neologisms from 2020-2023 collected through multiple methods including social media posts, news articles, and existing neologism datasets.
- The benchmark has 4 tasks: machine translation, cloze question answering, definition generation, and perplexity rankings.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis showing significantly lower performance of LLMs on neologisms versus non-neologisms in downstream tasks.
- Older LLMs like BART, T5, GPT-J perform much worse on neologisms with over 30% lower accuracy.
- Linguistic analysis illustrating lexical neologisms have higher perplexity but the best downstream performance. Semantic neologisms have low perplexity but struggle in generative tasks.
- The release of the benchmark and neologism dataset to systematically evaluate LLM robustness to neologisms over time.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the challenge neologisms pose for static LLMs through a new benchmark containing recent neologisms paired with intrinsic and downstream tasks. Analysis provides insight into differences based on model age and neologism linguistic properties.
