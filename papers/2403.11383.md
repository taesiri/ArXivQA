## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling quadrupedal robots is complex due to their high degrees of freedom and interactions with dynamic environments. Traditional model-based optimal controls like Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be ineffective in handling uncertainties and lack adaptability. 

- A key challenge is achieving real-time gait frequency adaptation, which is difficult to optimize with gradient-based methods. This adaptation is important for robust quadrupedal locomotion.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using Sample-Based Stochastic (SBS) control strategies as an alternative to traditional optimal controls for quadrupedal robots. 

- Two SBS algorithms are implemented: a naive optimizer and Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control. They rely on sampling control actions from a distribution, evaluating costs in parallel, and updating the distribution towards lower cost samples.

- The SBS framework easily optimizes gait parameters like frequency within the control loop by sampling over possible gaits. This enables real-time gait adaptation.

- GPU acceleration allows efficient parallel rollouts, enabling real-time operation. The SBS controller is integrated into a comprehensive quadrupedal locomotion system.

Contributions:
- First GPU-accelerated SBS predictive controller integrated into a 12-DOF quadrupedal robot.

- Demonstrates real-time gait frequency optimization for robustness against disturbances, which is challenging for gradient-based controls.

- Compares SBS methods against MPC in simulations and hardware experiments. SBS matches MPC in calm conditions and outperforms it in handling sustained disturbances.

- Provides open-source implementation for rapid testing of SBS controllers on quadrupedal platforms.

In summary, the paper shows SBS control as a practical and high-performing alternative over MPC for adaptive and resilient quadrupedal locomotion. The proposed system and gait optimization strategy enhances quadrupeds' real-world viability.
