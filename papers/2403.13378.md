# [IIDM: Image-to-Image Diffusion Model for Semantic Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13378)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing semantic image synthesis methods rely on GANs to generate images that match a segmentation mask and style reference image. However, GANs have limitations in satisfying multiple conditions simultaneously and lack flexibility.

Method: 
The authors propose the Image-to-Image Diffusion Model (IIDM) which treats semantic image synthesis as an image denoising problem. Specifically, the model progressively denoises a noise-contaminated style reference image guided by the segmentation mask through a latent diffusion process. This allows incorporating the style conditions and semantic guidance at different stages.

Contributions:
1. A novel image-to-image diffusion model that more efficiently handles the style reference and segmentation mask compared to appending separate encoders.

2. Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis. Superior image quality and style similarity over GAN-based methods in quantitative metrics and visual results.

3. Three techniques to further enhance IIDM inference - refinement for quality, color transfer for style recovery, and model ensembles for improved stability. All contribute to gains with little additional computational cost.

The proposed IIDM achieves 1st place on the Jittor AI Challenge semantic image track. Experiments extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of progressive denoising and flexibility of IIDM over existing GAN-based approaches. The techniques are simple extensions applicable to other conditional image generation tasks.
