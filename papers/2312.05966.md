# [Fake It Till Make It: Federated Learning with Consensus-Oriented   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Data heterogeneity across clients is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL) that limits performance. Existing works typically regard heterogeneity as an inherent property and aim to mitigate its adverse effects via model correction methods. However, the heterogeneity still persists to affect training throughout the FL process.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel methodology called FedCOG that seeks to address data heterogeneity from the perspective of data correction. The key idea is to generate additional data at each client that complements the original heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedCOG has two main components:

1) Complementary dataset generation: Each client generates task-specific data by optimizing the inputs to be correctly predicted by the global model but incorrectly predicted by the local model. This serves to reduce data heterogeneity and incorporates consensual knowledge.  

2) Knowledge distillation (KD) based model training: Besides the standard local training, each client additionally distills knowledge from the global model to the local model based on the generated dataset. This prevents overfitting to the original heterogeneous data.

Main Contributions:
- A new perspective of addressing data heterogeneity in FL via data correction 
- A novel method FedCOG with two components: complementary data generation and KD-based model training
- Experiments show FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and heterogeneity settings
- FedCOG has plug-and-play property to combine with other FL methods and is compatible with standard FL protocols like secure aggregation

In summary, this paper provides a novel data-oriented methodology to tackle the inherent data heterogeneity issue in federated learning, with strong empirical results and useful properties. The idea of correcting heterogeneity from the data itself is an interesting new direction for further exploration.
