# [Benchmark Results for Bookshelf Organization Problem as Mixed Integer   Nonlinear Program with Mode Switch and Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mixed integer convex/nonlinear programs (MICP/MINLP) are expressive formulations but require long solve times, limiting their use in real-time robotics applications. 
- Recent work combining data-driven methods with solver heuristics has potential to overcome this, but comprehensive benchmarks are lacking, especially for problems with discrete mode switches and collision avoidance constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a bookshelf organization problem as an MINLP with mode switching and collision avoidance constraints. This models inserting a new book to minimize disturbance of existing books.
- Benchmark different data-driven solution methods on this problem:
   - Complementarity formulation (MPCC) solved as NLP
   - Mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation
   - Convex relaxation solved as QP
- For each, evaluate success rate, solve time, optimal cost using dataset of pre-solved examples to provide warm starts.
- Compare to non-data-driven MINLP algorithms.
- Demonstrate hardware implementation with a robotic arm.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of bookshelf problem as practical MINLP benchmark incorporating discrete and continuous optimization with collision avoidance.
- First comparative benchmark of data-driven MPCC, MIP, and convex relaxation solution methods on a robotics MINLP.
- Demonstration that data-driven methods can achieve much faster solve times, higher success rate, and near optimal costs compared to non-data-driven techniques.
- Hardware demonstration showing feasibility of using data-driven solutions for real-time optimization-based planning.

In summary, this paper introduced a robotic MINLP benchmark problem and conducted a comprehensive comparison of data-driven solution techniques. The results showcase the potential of such methods to enable online mixed integer optimization for robotics motion planning problems.
