# [Benchmark Results for Bookshelf Organization Problem as Mixed Integer   Nonlinear Program with Mode Switch and Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mixed integer convex/nonlinear programs (MICP/MINLP) are expressive formulations but require long solve times, limiting their use in real-time robotics applications. 
- Recent work combining data-driven methods with solver heuristics has potential to overcome this, but comprehensive benchmarks are lacking, especially for problems with discrete mode switches and collision avoidance constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a bookshelf organization problem as an MINLP with mode switching and collision avoidance constraints. This models inserting a new book to minimize disturbance of existing books.
- Benchmark different data-driven solution methods on this problem:
   - Complementarity formulation (MPCC) solved as NLP
   - Mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation
   - Convex relaxation solved as QP
- For each, evaluate success rate, solve time, optimal cost using dataset of pre-solved examples to provide warm starts.
- Compare to non-data-driven MINLP algorithms.
- Demonstrate hardware implementation with a robotic arm.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of bookshelf problem as practical MINLP benchmark incorporating discrete and continuous optimization with collision avoidance.
- First comparative benchmark of data-driven MPCC, MIP, and convex relaxation solution methods on a robotics MINLP.
- Demonstration that data-driven methods can achieve much faster solve times, higher success rate, and near optimal costs compared to non-data-driven techniques.
- Hardware demonstration showing feasibility of using data-driven solutions for real-time optimization-based planning.

In summary, this paper introduced a robotic MINLP benchmark problem and conducted a comprehensive comparison of data-driven solution techniques. The results showcase the potential of such methods to enable online mixed integer optimization for robotics motion planning problems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a bookshelf organization problem as a benchmark for mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems. What are some key properties of this benchmark problem that make it suitable for evaluating optimization algorithms?

2. The paper compares multiple formulations for the bookshelf problem, including complementary, mixed-integer programming (MIP), and convex formulations. What are the tradeoffs between these formulations in terms of modeling power, computational complexity, and amenability to leveraging pre-solved data?

3. The paper introduces a method to warm start the complementary formulation using K-nearest neighbors on a dataset of pre-solved instances. What are some limitations of this approach and how might more advanced machine learning methods help? 

4. For the MIP formulation, the paper utilizes a method called ReDUCE to reduce the scale of the MIP by clustering on the solution manifold. Explain this method and discuss its similarities/differences to other MIP reduction techniques.

5. The convex formulation converts the problem into a convex QP by fixing all binary variables. What issues can arise when selecting integer variables using KNN in this setting and how might they be addressed?

6. The paper introduces a novel way of enforcing collision avoidance between convex shapes using separating planes. Explain this method and discuss how it compares to alternative techniques.

7. For the ADMM formulation, the paper manually selects a warm start point. How could data-driven methods be incorporated and would you expect performance improvements?

8. The benchmark results show tradeoffs between solution quality, solve times, and success rates for the different formulations. If you had to select one method to use in a real-time robotic application, which would you choose and why?

9. The methods are demonstrated on a small 3-4 book problem instance. How do you expect the performance of the different formulations to compare as the problem size scales up significantly?

10. The paper focuses on solving a single instance of inserting one book. How could the methods be extended to solve a sequence of insertions while minimizing total robot motion? What new modeling challenges might arise?
