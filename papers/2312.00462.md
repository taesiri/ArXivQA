# [Learning Unorthogonalized Matrices for Rotation Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00462)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes the issue of using orthogonalization procedures like Gram-Schmidt and SVD when learning rotation matrices with neural networks. Through gradient analysis, the authors show that orthogonalization leads to ambiguous updates and potentially exploding gradients during training. To address this, they propose representing rotations with unorthogonalized "pseudo" rotation matrices (PRoM) by removing the orthogonalization component during learning. Theoretically, they prove PRoM converges faster and to better solutions compared to methods with orthogonalization, owing to the non-injectivity of orthogonalizations. Empirically, simply by replacing existing rotation representations with PRoM, they achieve state-of-the-art results on several tasks, including human pose/shape estimation and point cloud pose estimation. The method demonstrates faster convergence, stability at larger learning rates, and overall better performance. By highlighting issues with common practices for learning rotations, this work provides both analysis and solutions to improve rotation estimation with neural networks.
