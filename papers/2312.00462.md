# [Learning Unorthogonalized Matrices for Rotation Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00462)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes the issue of using orthogonalization procedures like Gram-Schmidt and SVD when learning rotation matrices with neural networks. Through gradient analysis, the authors show that orthogonalization leads to ambiguous updates and potentially exploding gradients during training. To address this, they propose representing rotations with unorthogonalized "pseudo" rotation matrices (PRoM) by removing the orthogonalization component during learning. Theoretically, they prove PRoM converges faster and to better solutions compared to methods with orthogonalization, owing to the non-injectivity of orthogonalizations. Empirically, simply by replacing existing rotation representations with PRoM, they achieve state-of-the-art results on several tasks, including human pose/shape estimation and point cloud pose estimation. The method demonstrates faster convergence, stability at larger learning rates, and overall better performance. By highlighting issues with common practices for learning rotations, this work provides both analysis and solutions to improve rotation estimation with neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes removing orthogonalization constraints from the learning process for 3D rotation matrices and instead using unconstrained "pseudo" rotation matrices, showing both theoretically and empirically that it leads to faster convergence and better solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing to remove orthogonalization procedures from the learning process when estimating 3D rotations. Instead, the authors advocate learning unorthogonalized "pseudo" rotation matrices (PRoM) and only applying orthogonalization post-hoc during inference. 

Through gradient analysis, the authors show that common orthogonalization methods like Gram-Schmidt and SVD can cause ambiguous updates and exploding gradients during training. In contrast, learning PRoM provides more consistent gradients and faster convergence. The authors also theoretically prove that PRoM is guaranteed to converge to a better solution compared to methods that keep orthogonalization, due to the non-injectivity of orthogonalization functions.

Empirically, the authors demonstrate state-of-the-art results by simply replacing the rotation representation with PRoM in various tasks like human body/hand pose estimation and point cloud orientation prediction. This shows the effectiveness of removing orthogonalization constraints during training for learning rotations.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying issues with existing rotation learning approaches that use orthogonalization, proposing the concept of PRoM to address those issues, and both theoretically and empirically showing the benefits of this method.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Pseudo Rotation Matrices (PRoM) - The proposed unorthogonalized rotation matrix representation that avoids issues with orthogonalization during training.

- Orthogonalization - Common procedures like Gram-Schmidt process or SVD that enforce orthogonality constraints on estimated rotation matrices.

- Ambiguous updates - The paper shows these procedures can create ambiguity in gradient updates during training. 

- Gradient explosion - Orthogonalization can also sometimes create exploding gradients which destabilize training.  

- Non-local-injectivity - Concept explaining why removing orthogonalization (using PRoM) converges faster and to better solutions.

- 3D human pose estimation - Downstream task where estimating 3D rotations is important. Replacing rotations with PRoM gives state-of-the-art results.

- Convergence analysis - Theoretical analysis showing PRoM converges faster and to better optima compared to methods with orthogonalization.

So in summary, the key ideas are: (1) proposing PRoM, (2) analyzing issues with orthogonalization, and (3) showing benefits of PRoM theoretically and on pose estimation tasks. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning unorthogonalized matrices called Pseudo Rotation Matrices (PRoM) instead of enforcing orthogonality during training. Can you explain in more detail why enforcing orthogonality leads to ambiguous updates and exploding gradients?

2. The optimization analysis proves that gradient descent with PRoM converges faster and to a better solution compared to methods that incorporate orthogonalization during training. Can you walk through the key steps in the proof to explain this result? 

3. The paper evaluates PRoM on several downstream tasks like human pose estimation and point cloud pose estimation. For a sample downstream task, can you outline the full computational graph and loss function used during training with and without PRoM?

4. For the human pose experiments, the paper trains on a mixture of 3D and 2D datasets. What is the rationale behind this mixed training strategy? How are the 2D datasets utilized during training?

5. The ablation studies analyze the impact of removing orthogonalization from only the rotation loss or only the downstream task loss. Why is removing it from the downstream task loss more critical for performance?  

6. The optimization analysis relies on assumptions that the neural network mapping is non-convex while the loss criterion is convex. Do you think these assumptions hold generally? When might they be violated?  

7. The paper recommends applying orthogonalization during inference after training with PRoM. Is this necessary? What tradeoffs are there with skipping the post-hoc orthogonalization?

8. Could the benefits of training with PRoM transfer to other prediction tasks that rely on orthogonal matrices besides pose estimation? What challenges might arise?

9. The paper analyzes gradient ambiguity and explosion when using common orthogonalizations like Gram-Schmidt and SVD. Are there alternative orthogonalization techniques that could avoid these issues?

10. How do you think PRoM would compare to other methods that avoid orthogonalization during training, like predicting delta rotations? What are the relative advantages/disadvantages?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Estimating 3D rotations is important for many computer vision tasks like human pose estimation. Rotations are typically represented using over-parameterized forms like rotation matrices or quaternions and constrained to be orthogonal during learning. This paper analyzes the effects of common orthogonalization procedures like Gram-Schmidt process and SVD on the training process. 

Key Findings:
- Orthogonalization leads to ambiguous gradient updates as the update for one rotation matrix column depends on the difference between other columns and their ground truths. This slows down convergence.

- Orthogonalizations are also numerically unstable, leading to exploding gradients when matrix columns become nearly parallel. This destabilizes training.

- Orthogonalization functions are non-injective, meaning multiple unconstrained estimates can map to the same constrained output. This causes suboptimal convergence compared to directly predicting the constrained quantity.

Method: 
The paper proposes learning unconstrained 'pseudo' rotation matrices (PRoM) without any orthogonalization during training. Orthogonalization is only applied at test time. This avoids ambiguity, instability and non-injectivity issues.

Contributions:
- Identifies fundamental issues with commonly used orthogonalization techniques
- Proves theoretically and empirically that removing orthogonalization leads to faster, more stable training and better convergence
- Achieves SOTA results on human pose estimation by simply switching rotation representation to PRoM

Overall, the paper makes a strong case for avoiding orthogonalization during learning of rotations. Theorems prove PRoM's faster convergence, while experiments show downstream task accuracy improves by simply changing a few lines of code. The analysis furthers the understanding of learning constrained quantities like rotations.
