# [EgoPlan-Bench: Benchmarking Egocentric Embodied Planning with Multimodal   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise for embodied task planning, but their capabilities have not been thoroughly evaluated, especially for real-world scenarios involving complex visual observations over long time horizons. 

- Existing benchmarks for egocentric videos focus on comprehension based on full video demonstrations rather than step-by-step planning conditioned on real-time progress.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces EgoPlan-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating embodied planning that features realistic tasks, diverse actions, and intricate visual observations derived from real-world egocentric videos.

- The paper evaluates 21 prominent MLLMs and finds most achieve only slightly better than random guessing, indicating significant room for improvement. Case studies reveal issues in detecting subtle visual state changes and recognizing target objects.

- To enhance models, the paper constructs an instruction tuning dataset called EgoPlan-IT specialized for egocentric embodied planning. Using this data combined with contrastive learning objectives, the authors improve an MLLM's performance substantially, with over 50% accuracy on EgoPlan-Bench.

Main Contributions:
- EgoPlan-Bench: A rigorous benchmark for assessing embodied planning abilities using real-world egocentric video data.

- Analysis of limitations of current MLLMs on complex embodied planning.

- EgoPlan-IT: Specialized instruction tuning dataset for enhancing models' experience with egocentric tasks. 

- Demonstration that models tuned on EgoPlan-IT data not only perform better on the benchmark, but also can serve as effective planners to guide embodied agents in simulations.
