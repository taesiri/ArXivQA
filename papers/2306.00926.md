# [Inserting Anybody in Diffusion Models via Celeb Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00926)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we effectively personalize diffusion models like Stable Diffusion to generate high-quality images of new identities/concepts (e.g. a specific person) using only a single image of that identity as input?The key hypothesis proposed is:By building a "celeb basis" from the text embedding space of celebrity names, and representing new identities as a weighted combination of basis vectors, the model can learn to generate high quality, identity-consistent images of new people using only a small number of tunable parameters. In summary, the paper aims to tackle the problem of personalizing diffusion models for new identities in a highly efficient and effective way, by constructing a celeb basis that allows new identities to be seamlessly inserted into the pretrained model's embedding space using just a single facial photo and a small number of optimized basis coefficients.The experiments then aim to validate whether this celeb basis approach enables the model to generate better identity-preserving and concept-combining results for new individuals compared to previous personalization techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a "celeb basis" built from the text embedding space of celebrity names in a pre-trained text-to-image model. They show this basis has useful properties like the ability to interpolate between identities. 2. Using the celeb basis to develop a new personalization method that can memorize a new person from a single facial photo, using only 1024 learnable coefficients. 3. Demonstrating that their personalized model has stronger concept composition abilities than previous methods. For example, it can generate better identity-preserved images and enable interaction between multiple newly added identities.In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing the celeb basis idea and using it to enable efficient and effective personalization of diffusion models to insert new identities, with improved concept combination abilities compared to prior arts. The key novelty appears to be building and utilizing the celeb basis for identity representation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method to personalize pretrained text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion to generate images of new identities using only a single facial photo, 1024 learnable parameters, and 3 minutes of training time by building a celeb basis from celebrity name embeddings and optimizing coefficients to fit new faces into this basis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a comparison to other related research:- The paper introduces a new approach for personalizing diffusion models using a "celeb basis" built from celebrity name embeddings. This is a novel idea compared to prior work on personalizing diffusion models, which has focused more on finetuning the model weights or optimizing token embeddings. - The celeb basis idea is inspired by 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) for faces, which represent faces as a mean plus weighted combination of basis vectors. Extending this to text embeddings of celebrity names is creative.- For personalizing a model on a new identity, the paper only requires optimizing 1024 basis coefficients from a single facial photo, which is far more efficient than prior methods like DreamBooth or Textual Inversion that finetune the entire model.- The paper shows the celeb basis can interpolate between identities and has strong concept combination abilities. This is an advantage over prior work like DreamBooth where the personalized identities often fail at complex concept combinations.- The proposed method also demonstrates the ability to jointly personalize on multiple identities simultaneously. This is difficult for prior methods like Custom Diffusion.- For evaluation, the paper compares to recent state-of-the-art personalization techniques like DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, and Custom Diffusion. The experiments show advantages of the proposed approach in identity preservation, concept combination, and efficiency.- The idea of representing new identities via a pretrained basis is also explored for GANs and image generation in some concurrent works like Instant-Booth and Taming-Encoder. This paper is one of the first to investigate this direction for diffusion model personalization.In summary, the celeb basis approach is a novel and efficient way to personalize diffusion models that shows promise for improved identity preservation and concept combination abilities compared to previous methods. The idea of learning representations in a pretrained canonical basis is an interesting research direction for generative model personalization.
