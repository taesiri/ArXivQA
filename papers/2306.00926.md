# [Inserting Anybody in Diffusion Models via Celeb Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00926)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we effectively personalize diffusion models like Stable Diffusion to generate high-quality images of new identities/concepts (e.g. a specific person) using only a single image of that identity as input?The key hypothesis proposed is:By building a "celeb basis" from the text embedding space of celebrity names, and representing new identities as a weighted combination of basis vectors, the model can learn to generate high quality, identity-consistent images of new people using only a small number of tunable parameters. In summary, the paper aims to tackle the problem of personalizing diffusion models for new identities in a highly efficient and effective way, by constructing a celeb basis that allows new identities to be seamlessly inserted into the pretrained model's embedding space using just a single facial photo and a small number of optimized basis coefficients.The experiments then aim to validate whether this celeb basis approach enables the model to generate better identity-preserving and concept-combining results for new individuals compared to previous personalization techniques.
