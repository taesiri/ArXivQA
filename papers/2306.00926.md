# [Inserting Anybody in Diffusion Models via Celeb Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00926)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we effectively personalize diffusion models like Stable Diffusion to generate high-quality images of new identities/concepts (e.g. a specific person) using only a single image of that identity as input?The key hypothesis proposed is:By building a "celeb basis" from the text embedding space of celebrity names, and representing new identities as a weighted combination of basis vectors, the model can learn to generate high quality, identity-consistent images of new people using only a small number of tunable parameters. In summary, the paper aims to tackle the problem of personalizing diffusion models for new identities in a highly efficient and effective way, by constructing a celeb basis that allows new identities to be seamlessly inserted into the pretrained model's embedding space using just a single facial photo and a small number of optimized basis coefficients.The experiments then aim to validate whether this celeb basis approach enables the model to generate better identity-preserving and concept-combining results for new individuals compared to previous personalization techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a "celeb basis" built from the text embedding space of celebrity names in a pre-trained text-to-image model. They show this basis has useful properties like the ability to interpolate between identities. 2. Using the celeb basis to develop a new personalization method that can memorize a new person from a single facial photo, using only 1024 learnable coefficients. 3. Demonstrating that their personalized model has stronger concept composition abilities than previous methods. For example, it can generate better identity-preserved images and enable interaction between multiple newly added identities.In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing the celeb basis idea and using it to enable efficient and effective personalization of diffusion models to insert new identities, with improved concept combination abilities compared to prior arts. The key novelty appears to be building and utilizing the celeb basis for identity representation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method to personalize pretrained text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion to generate images of new identities using only a single facial photo, 1024 learnable parameters, and 3 minutes of training time by building a celeb basis from celebrity name embeddings and optimizing coefficients to fit new faces into this basis.
