# Mindstorms in Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we construct societies of neural networks that collaborate through natural language communication to solve complex tasks? The key hypothesis appears to be: By having neural networks communicate with each other in natural language during a "mindstorm", they will be able to collectively solve challenging problems that individual networks cannot.The authors propose creating "natural language-based societies of minds" (NLSOMs) where different neural networks, such as large language models and vision models, can discuss tasks through natural language dialog. They hypothesize that the mindstorming and cooperation enabled by these NLSOMs will allow the ensemble to solve problems that require combining different skills and modalities.Experiments are then conducted with NLSOMs on tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, embodied AI, and more. The results aim to demonstrate that NLSOMs can successfully collaborate and outperform individual models, lending support to the central hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to construct cooperative NLSOMs, and the core hypothesis is that they will be able to solve complex, multimodal tasks through natural language-based mindstorming. The experiments aim to provide evidence for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing the concept of natural language based societies of minds (NLSOMs) - where neural networks communicate with each other primarily through natural language interfaces. This is inspired by Minsky's "society of mind" idea and Schmidhuber's "learning to think" work. 2. Conducting experiments with NLSOMs on a diverse set of AI tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and general language task solving. The NLSOMs in the experiments have up to 129 "agent" neural networks.3. Demonstrating that NLSOMs can overcome limitations of individual neural networks and improve multimodal zero-shot reasoning through collaborative "mindstorms". The mindstorms involve iterative communication between the agents in natural language.4. Showing that new agents are easily added to NLSOMs in a modular way since the communication interface (natural language) remains consistent. This aligns well with goals of developing scalable and explainable AI systems.5. Discussing open questions related to designing the structure and organization of large scale NLSOMs - including concepts like monarchies vs democracies, emergent coalitions, etc. 6. Proposing the idea of extending NLSOMs to "Economies of Mind" where agents are incentivized through a shared currency and contracts to maximize rewards / solve problems. This is inspired by prior work on neural network economies.In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing the NLSOM concept and methodology, evaluating it on diverse tasks, and outlining interesting open questions related to developing and organizing societies of neural networks. The paper serves as a starting point for research on increasingly large and capable NLSOMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review, the main point of the paper seems to be introducing the concept of natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs) - networks of neural modules that can communicate with each other through natural language interfaces to solve problems that are challenging for any individual module. The key idea is that natural language allows easy integration of new modules and analysis of the collaborative problem-solving process. The paper demonstrates the potential of NLSOMs through experiments on tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, retrieval, embodied AI, and general language problem solving. Overall, it advocates NLSOMs as a promising approach to developing more capable and interpretable AI systems through emergent collaboration.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a novel framework for constructing societies of neural networks that can communicate through natural language to solve complex tasks. Other recent work has explored combining large language models (LLMs) with other neural networks, but this paper introduces the idea of creating entire "societies of minds" where many different agents can interact.- A key innovation is the concept of "mindstorming" where agents engage in rounds of natural language communication to iteratively refine their understanding of a problem. This is inspired by human brainstorming but implemented between artificial agents. Other research has focused on single models while this explores emergent reasoning through agent interaction.- The paper demonstrates mindstorming on a diverse set of multimodal tasks including VQA, image captioning, text-to-image generation, etc. Each experiment configures customized agents with specialized abilities tailored to the task. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach. In contrast, most prior work probes multimodal reasoning ability within a single model.- The approach is shown to outperform individual state-of-the-art models on certain tasks, demonstrating the benefits of compositionality and emergent reasoning. Other benchmarks have focused on measuring capability of individual models. This paper makes a case for assessing collaborative intelligence.- The authors propose extensions such as economies of minds and suggest implications for AI alignment, transparency, and controllability. Most similar research has not delved as deeply into the societal aspects and long-term potential.In summary, this paper presents a novel paradigm for constructing large-scale AI systems as societies of interacting agents. The key innovations around composable mindstorming and emergent reasoning distinguish it from prior work that has focused on scaling up individual models. The societal perspective also suggests unique directions for future research.
