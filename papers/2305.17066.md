# [Mindstorms in Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we construct societies of neural networks that collaborate through natural language communication to solve complex tasks? 

The key hypothesis appears to be: By having neural networks communicate with each other in natural language during a "mindstorm", they will be able to collectively solve challenging problems that individual networks cannot.

The authors propose creating "natural language-based societies of minds" (NLSOMs) where different neural networks, such as large language models and vision models, can discuss tasks through natural language dialog. They hypothesize that the mindstorming and cooperation enabled by these NLSOMs will allow the ensemble to solve problems that require combining different skills and modalities.

Experiments are then conducted with NLSOMs on tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, embodied AI, and more. The results aim to demonstrate that NLSOMs can successfully collaborate and outperform individual models, lending support to the central hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is how to construct cooperative NLSOMs, and the core hypothesis is that they will be able to solve complex, multimodal tasks through natural language-based mindstorming. The experiments aim to provide evidence for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing the concept of natural language based societies of minds (NLSOMs) - where neural networks communicate with each other primarily through natural language interfaces. This is inspired by Minsky's "society of mind" idea and Schmidhuber's "learning to think" work. 

2. Conducting experiments with NLSOMs on a diverse set of AI tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and general language task solving. The NLSOMs in the experiments have up to 129 "agent" neural networks.

3. Demonstrating that NLSOMs can overcome limitations of individual neural networks and improve multimodal zero-shot reasoning through collaborative "mindstorms". The mindstorms involve iterative communication between the agents in natural language.

4. Showing that new agents are easily added to NLSOMs in a modular way since the communication interface (natural language) remains consistent. This aligns well with goals of developing scalable and explainable AI systems.

5. Discussing open questions related to designing the structure and organization of large scale NLSOMs - including concepts like monarchies vs democracies, emergent coalitions, etc. 

6. Proposing the idea of extending NLSOMs to "Economies of Mind" where agents are incentivized through a shared currency and contracts to maximize rewards / solve problems. This is inspired by prior work on neural network economies.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing the NLSOM concept and methodology, evaluating it on diverse tasks, and outlining interesting open questions related to developing and organizing societies of neural networks. The paper serves as a starting point for research on increasingly large and capable NLSOMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review, the main point of the paper seems to be introducing the concept of natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs) - networks of neural modules that can communicate with each other through natural language interfaces to solve problems that are challenging for any individual module. The key idea is that natural language allows easy integration of new modules and analysis of the collaborative problem-solving process. The paper demonstrates the potential of NLSOMs through experiments on tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, retrieval, embodied AI, and general language problem solving. Overall, it advocates NLSOMs as a promising approach to developing more capable and interpretable AI systems through emergent collaboration.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper presents a novel framework for constructing societies of neural networks that can communicate through natural language to solve complex tasks. Other recent work has explored combining large language models (LLMs) with other neural networks, but this paper introduces the idea of creating entire "societies of minds" where many different agents can interact.

- A key innovation is the concept of "mindstorming" where agents engage in rounds of natural language communication to iteratively refine their understanding of a problem. This is inspired by human brainstorming but implemented between artificial agents. Other research has focused on single models while this explores emergent reasoning through agent interaction.

- The paper demonstrates mindstorming on a diverse set of multimodal tasks including VQA, image captioning, text-to-image generation, etc. Each experiment configures customized agents with specialized abilities tailored to the task. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach. In contrast, most prior work probes multimodal reasoning ability within a single model.

- The approach is shown to outperform individual state-of-the-art models on certain tasks, demonstrating the benefits of compositionality and emergent reasoning. Other benchmarks have focused on measuring capability of individual models. This paper makes a case for assessing collaborative intelligence.

- The authors propose extensions such as economies of minds and suggest implications for AI alignment, transparency, and controllability. Most similar research has not delved as deeply into the societal aspects and long-term potential.

In summary, this paper presents a novel paradigm for constructing large-scale AI systems as societies of interacting agents. The key innovations around composable mindstorming and emergent reasoning distinguish it from prior work that has focused on scaling up individual models. The societal perspective also suggests unique directions for future research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring more complex and larger-scale NLSOM systems with more agents and longer, less restricted mindstorms. The authors note the mindstorms shown in the paper are relatively simple and constrained. Further work is needed on enabling more free-form, complex communication.

- Conducting more rigorous quantitative experiments and comparisons of different NLSOM structures like monarchies vs democracies. The authors mention their experiments are limited in this regard.

- Incorporating learning into the NLSOMs, as the current experiments only demonstrate zero-shot prompting. Adding reinforcement learning could allow the NLSOMs to improve over time.

- Developing Economies of Mind (EOMs) where parts of the NLSOM are incentivized through a shared currency to provide services to each other. The authors propose using principles of supply/demand and contract-based agreements between NLSOM members.

- Merging human experts into NLSOMs and studying the resulting societal dynamics and structures. The authors envision future NLSOMs interacting with humans.

- Addressing the ethical concerns and potential risks of large, open-ended NLSOMs before deploying them in uncontrolled real world situations. Safety research is needed.

In summary, the main directions are scaling up the NLSOMs, making them more flexible, adding learning, incorporating economics/incentives, blending human and AI agents, and conducting safety research before uncontrolled deployment. The future possibilities seem vast according to the authors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper discusses natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs), which are systems inspired by Minsky's society of mind and Schmidhuber's learning to think concepts. The authors assemble and experiment with several NLSOMs, with up to 129 "agents" communicating in natural language, to solve tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, retrieval, embodied AI, and general language problem solving. They show that NLSOMs can outperform individual models on these tasks through collaborative "mindstorms." The paper also proposes extending NLSOMs to "economies of mind", where agents are rewarded with money for services to facilitate credit assignment. Overall, the work demonstrates the promise of modular, scalable NLSOMs for advancing AI.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs) - inspired by Minsky's idea of a society of mind and Schmidhuber's work on learning to think - consisting of diverse populations of large neural networks that communicate through a natural language interface. Recent implementations of neural network-based societies have used large language models (LLMs) and other neural network experts that communicate in natural language, overcoming limitations of individual LLM systems. NLSOMs have advantages such as easier scalability, modularity, explainability, and human-alignment. The authors construct and experiment with NLSOMs of up to 129 members, leveraging "mindstorms" - inspired by human brainstorming processes - to collaboratively solve tasks like visual QA, image captioning, text-to-image generation, 3D generation, retrieval, embodied AI, and general language problem solving. They find that carefully structured mindstorms among larger NLSOM populations tend to outperform smaller groups and shorter discussions. Different social structures like monarchies and democracies are also explored. Finally, the authors propose extending this work to reinforcement learning-based "Economies of Mind" where members learn to maximize rewards by paying each other for services. Overall, the paper provides a starting point for research into larger-scale NLSOMs and their applications.

The second paragraph summarizes some key open questions and future work motivated by NLSOMs. How should social structures be designed - would a "monarchical" or "democratic" structure be better for certain tasks? Can principles from neural network economies be used to maximize rewards in an NLSOM reinforcement learning setting? As NLSOMs grow very large, including potentially human experts, how should the legislative, executive, and judiciary functions be separated? The paper argues that the natural language basis of NLSOMs is key to studying such questions, inspired by but extending prior work on neural chat and multi-agent RL. Implementing ideas like algorithmic information theory and contractual agreements between modules could produce more scalable, transparent and powerful AI systems. But the possibilities opened by NLSOMs also raise concerns about potentially unconstrained emergent behavior. Overall, the authors present NLSOMs as a rich area for future AI research, with open questions spanning social sciences, economics, law and more.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes natural language-based societies of minds (NLSOMs) as a way to implement large-scale multimodal reasoning systems. The NLSOM consists of heterogeneous modules, including large language models (LLMs) and other neural networks, that communicate with each other through natural language. The key element is the "mindstorm", where agents repeatedly exchange information and refine their understanding of a task through rounds of natural language dialogue. The authors construct NLSOMs with up to 129 members and test them on tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, and embodied question answering. The modular, language-based interface allows easy scalability while the mindstorm leverages collaborative reasoning. Results show that NLSOMs outperform individual modules across tasks, demonstrating the power of composing specialized networks through natural language communication.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key focus of this paper seems to be exploring the potential of "mindstorms" in large neural network-based societies that communicate primarily through natural language (referred to as NLSOMs). The paper discusses how the concept of mindstorms, inspired by human brainstorming and dialogue, can allow diverse collections of neural networks to collaborate and reason collectively to solve complex tasks. 

Some of the core questions and problems it seems to be addressing are:

- How can principles of neural network economies and societies of mind be combined to create large, scalable, and powerful AI systems based on natural language?

- What are the advantages of having neural networks communicate through a common natural language interface versus more rigid, predefined communication protocols?

- How can neural networks be prompted/incentivized to participate in collaborative mindstorming conversations to solve problems? 

- What types of neural network societies and organizational structures (monarchies, democracies, etc.) are most optimal for different tasks?

- How can mindstorms allow individual neural networks to contribute their strengths while overcoming their limitations through collaboration?

- What are the broader implications of creating increasingly large and sophisticated NLSOMs in terms of AI alignment, transparency, scalability, and more?

So in summary, the paper seems focused on introducing and exploring NLSOMs that leverage collaborative, language-based mindstorming to push towards more powerful, scalable, and human-understandable AI systems. The advantages, variations, capabilities, and future directions of this approach are analyzed.
