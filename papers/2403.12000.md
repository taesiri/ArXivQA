# [Notochord: a Flexible Probabilistic Model for Real-Time MIDI Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for generating music have shown promise, but have not been well studied in real-time performance settings where low latency response is critical. This is an important setting though for enabling more embodied and interactive musical experiences between humans and AI systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors design a new deep probabilistic model called Notochord that is optimized for low latency musical sequence modeling and generation. 

- Notochord represents musical sequences as streams of MIDI note events, decomposed into sub-events like pitch, velocity, timing, instrument. It models these streams autoregressively, so each event depends on previous context.

- Critically, Notochord models the sub-events in an order-agnostic way, allowing users to constrain or sample any sub-event first and have it condition the others. This supports many applications.

- The neural architecture uses a RNN and mixture density outputs to balance low latency with modeling capability.

Contributions:
- New flexible probabilistic model for musical sequence modeling that works at low (sub-10ms) latency

- Order-agnostic factorization of note events that allows for rich conditional interventions on sub-event types

- Training framework that ensures robustness to different sub-event orderings

- Proof-of-concept demonstration of model capabilities on tasks like steerable generation, harmonization, live coding, and novel interfaces

- Release of open-source code, model checkpoints, and examples to enable further research

In summary, the paper introduces a new deep learning model tailored for low-latency musical interaction and creativity support between humans and AI systems. It makes both theoretical contributions in the model design and practical ones through open-source code/models.
