# [Interpreting Time Series Transformer Models and Sensitivity Analysis of   Population Age Groups to COVID-19 Infections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Interpreting complex deep learning time series models like transformers is challenging but important for model transparency and reliability. Prior works have limitations in using simpler models or synthetic datasets.

- Evaluating interpretation methods is difficult due to lack of ground truth. Common practice is to perturb input features based on attribution scores and measure output change.

- Understanding COVID-19 infection spread across different age groups over time is an important and challenging problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Use state-of-the-art transformer models like FEDformer with multivariate, multi-horizon daily COVID-19 infection data for 3,142 US counties over 3 years.

- Collect granular COVID-19 infection data by age groups at the weekly level to serve as ground truth for evaluating age group attribution.

- Apply and compare 8 recent local interpretation methods using perturbation-based evaluation metrics in the absence of interpretation ground truth.

- Propose using feature attribution scores from interpretation methods to predict relative infection rates across age groups and compare with ground truth over time.

Main Contributions:
- Show interpretation methods can be applied to state-of-the-art time series transformer models using highly dynamic real-world datasets.

- Collect extensive COVID-19 dataset at county and age group level for modeling and evaluation.

- Rigorously benchmark and compare performance of 8 local interpretation methods on time series data.

- Propose and demonstrate approach to predict and evaluate feature attribution for population age groups over time using COVID-19 infection data.

- Show applicability of approach to other time series datasets like Electricity and Traffic.

In summary, the paper focuses on interpreting complex time series deep learning models on multivariate dynamic data and evaluating feature attribution, with a case study on modeling and understanding COVID-19 infection spread across age groups.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper interprets time series transformer models for COVID-19 forecasting using local interpretation methods, evaluates prediction sensitivity to population age groups, and demonstrates the generic applicability of the proposed interpretation framework on electricity and traffic datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Using highly dynamic, multivariate, multi-horizon, and multi-modal COVID-19 infection data with state-of-the-art time series transformer models to interpret them.

2. Collecting around three years of daily COVID-19 data for 3,142 US counties and using the last 14 days to predict cases for the next 14 days at the county level.

3. Focusing on local interpretation methods to show the contribution of each input feature to the prediction for a given input sample, and benchmarking the interpretation using eight recent methods. 

4. Proposing an innovative way to evaluate the prediction sensitivity to 8 population age groups over the highly dynamic multivariate infection data. 

5. Applying the proposed framework to traffic and electricity datasets to demonstrate that it is generic and can be applied to other time-series domains.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating an interpretable time series forecasting framework using state-of-the-art models on multivariate COVID-19 as well as other benchmark time series datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework to interpret time series transformer models for COVID-19 forecasting. What are some of the key challenges in interpreting these complex models compared to simpler time series models according to the authors?

2. The paper evaluates interpretation methods both quantitatively using perturbation-based analysis and with weekly COVID-19 cases by age group as ground truth. What are some limitations of using perturbation analysis for evaluation? And what are some challenges in using the weekly age group data as ground truth?

3. The paper proposes a temporal adaptation of the Morris sensitivity analysis method. How is this method adapted for time series data? What are some of the implementation challenges compared to using existing interpretation libraries?

4. The FEDformer model is chosen as the best performing model for COVID-19 forecasting. What architecture modifications does this model propose over vanilla transformer models? And how do those modifications help with time series modeling?

5. The paper evaluates age group sensitivity analysis using normalized infection rates. Why is normalized rate used instead of raw infection counts? What trends can be observed from the normalized importance scores over time?

6. For the sample interpretation result shown for the Los Angeles county, why do recent infections get higher attribution values compared to older infections according to the authors? Does this observation align with expected real-world medical knowledge?

7. The paper uses eight recent local interpretation methods for benchmarking. What are the key differences between gradient-based vs perturbation-based interpretation methods? What are some pros and cons of both categories?

8. How is the evaluation done using the Area Over the Perturbation Curve for Regression (AOPCR) metric? What does a higher AOPCR comprehensiveness or lower AOPCR sufficiency score signify in terms of interpretation performance?

9. The paper evaluates interpretation methods on two additional time series datasets. What are some challenges in applying the COVID-19 interpretation framework on other domains like electricity load or traffic data? Would the age group analysis be applicable there?

10. The paper discusses time complexity of different interpretation methods. Why is the Morris sensitivity method slower compared to gradient-based methods like Integrated Gradients or DeepLift? How can the run time be improved in practice?
