# [Chain-of-Specificity: An Iteratively Refining Method for Eliciting   Knowledge from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15526)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) sometimes struggle to adhere to specific constraints in input instructions, overlooking them and providing overly generic or unsatisfactory responses. 
- Existing methods attempting to address this issue by decomposing or rewriting instructions fall short in emphasizing constraints and unlocking underlying domain knowledge.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Chain-of-Specificity (CoS), an iterative method to elicit knowledge from LLMs and strengthen adherence to specific constraints.  
- CoS first identifies the general goal and all specific constraints from instructions.
- It then takes constraints as a reasoning chain, iteratively emphasizing them to unlock knowledge in LLMs and refine responses.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes CoS method to iteratively elicit knowledge from LLMs and refine responses for improved specificity.
- Develops ConstrainSPEC dataset with more complex specific constraints to simulate real-world situations.
- Experiments show CoS outperforms baselines in specificity, especially as constraint number increases.
- Shows distilling CoS responses to smaller models effectively enhances their constrained instruction following.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective technique to improve LLMs' ability to adhere to specific constraints, validated through a new complex dataset. Key innovations include the CoS method and ConstrainSPEC dataset for advancing research on constrained language generation.
