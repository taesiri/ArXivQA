# [GAN Vocoder: Multi-Resolution Discriminator Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05236)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be: The key factor underlying the recent success of GAN-based vocoders is the multi-resolution discriminating framework, rather than the specific architectural details, loss functions, or training strategies used.The authors test this hypothesis by evaluating six different generator architectures paired with a shared multi-resolution discriminator framework. Their results show that the vocoder performance is similar across all six generator architectures when using the same discriminator, supporting the idea that the discriminator is the critical component rather than the generator details.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the multi-resolution discriminating framework is the most important factor in creating high-quality GAN vocoders, more so than the specific generator architecture. The experiments pairing various generators with a shared discriminator aim to demonstrate this.
