# [GAN Vocoder: Multi-Resolution Discriminator Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05236)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be: The key factor underlying the recent success of GAN-based vocoders is the multi-resolution discriminating framework, rather than the specific architectural details, loss functions, or training strategies used.The authors test this hypothesis by evaluating six different generator architectures paired with a shared multi-resolution discriminator framework. Their results show that the vocoder performance is similar across all six generator architectures when using the same discriminator, supporting the idea that the discriminator is the critical component rather than the generator details.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the multi-resolution discriminating framework is the most important factor in creating high-quality GAN vocoders, more so than the specific generator architecture. The experiments pairing various generators with a shared discriminator aim to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is experimentally demonstrating that the multi-resolution discriminating framework is the key factor behind the recent successes of GAN vocoders, rather than the specific architectural details or training strategies used in individual models. The authors pair 6 different GAN vocoder generators, including a proposed new one, with the same multi-resolution discriminator from HiFi-GAN. They find that despite major architectural differences between the generators, their performance on both objective metrics like MCD and subjective metrics like MOS is very similar when paired with the same discriminator. This supports their hypothesis that the multi-resolution discriminating framework, which allows the discriminator to operate on multiple timescales, is the most important factor for achieving high-fidelity speech synthesis using GANs. The details of the generator architecture seem to matter less, as long as it can capture long-term dependencies in the audio and is densely connected to propagate gradients.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating through experiments that the multi-resolution discriminator, not the generator details, is the secret behind recent advancements in GAN vocoders. This points to the discriminator being a fruitful area to focus future research for further improving speech synthesis with GANs.
