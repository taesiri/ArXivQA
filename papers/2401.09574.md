# [Towards Scalable and Robust Model Versioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in industrial settings, the threat of malicious attacks to gain access to these models is growing. Once attackers gain white-box access to a deployed model, they can craft adversarial examples to manipulate the model's outputs and make its classifications unreliable. However, rebuilding compromised models requires substantial time and resources to re-collect training data. This motivates the need for mechanisms to continuously replace leaked models without needing new data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a method to generate multiple model versions from a single training dataset, called "optimized hidden training". The key idea is to artificially inject parameterized "hidden data" that is irrelevant to the main classification task into the training data. By optimizing the choice of distributions used to sample this hidden data for each model version, different model versions can be created that achieve high task accuracy while having distinct vulnerabilities against attacks. 

Specifically, hidden data is constructed to match certain "hidden feature points" in the feature space of an original model. By varying this hidden feature point across model versions, each model learns unique non-robust features based on the augmented hidden data. A replacement model can then be selected that is robust against attacks crafted on previously breached models.

Contributions:
1) Formalizes the problem of scalable and robust model versioning without new data
2) Provides an analytical study showing importance of optimizing selection of hidden distributions   
3) Develops a practical algorithm to generate model versions for DNNs using greedy search to pick hidden distributions, outperforming alternatives

The method produces sequences of model versions that achieve resilience against "compound transferability attacks" that leverage multiple leaked models. Experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate significant robustness improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to generate multiple robust versions of a machine learning model from a single training dataset by incorporating parameterized hidden data into the training data, in order to maintain reliable model performance despite potential repeated model breaches over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formally defines the problem of scalable and robust model versioning, where models need to be replaced upon breaches while maintaining accuracy and robustness against compound transferability attacks over time. This is an important but under-explored problem.

2. It proposes a solution called "optimized hidden training" which involves carefully selecting and incorporating hidden distributions into the training data to force models to learn task-irrelevant features that can introduce variability across model versions. 

3. It provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on deep neural networks to demonstrate the importance of optimizing the choice of hidden distributions, instead of random selection. Theoretical proofs show that optimized selection can upper bound compound attack transferability over a sequence of model versions.

4. It designs, implements and evaluates a practical greedy algorithm for selecting hidden distributions and generating robust model sequences for DNN classifiers. Experiments on three image classification tasks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms alternative methods in maintaining accuracy while resisting compound attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel concept of optimized hidden training to enable scalable and robust model versioning, together with analytical and empirical validation of its effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with it:

- Model versioning - The problem of generating multiple versions of a machine learning model from the same training data to replace leaked/breached models over time.

- Hidden training - The proposed method of incorporating parameterized "hidden distributions" into the training data to produce diverse model versions with different attack properties. 

- Attack transferability - The phenomenon where adversarial attacks generated for one model often succeed against other similar models. Reducing this is a key challenge.  

- Compound transferability attacks - A novel form of attack where the adversary has white-box access to multiple previously leaked model versions and can orchestrate a more powerful attack against the newly deployed model version.

- Directional/pairwise attack transferability - Transferability between two models.

- Greedy optimization - The greedy algorithm proposed to select hidden distributions in order to minimize compound transferability between model versions over time. 

- Analytical study - The theoretical analysis done using linear SVMs to demonstrate importance of optimizing choice of hidden distributions.

So in summary, the key focus is on using optimized hidden training to generate robust model versions that can resist compound transferability attacks from adversaries with access to previously leaked versions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a method of "hidden training" to generate multiple model versions with different attack properties from a single training dataset. How exactly does the choice of "hidden distributions" impact the decision boundaries and attack landscapes of the resulting models? Can you characterize the precise relationship?

2. The paper argues that using a single "hidden feature point" is better than multiple points when generating hidden data. However, what are the potential limitations of relying only on perturbations along a single feature dimension? When would using multiple feature points be preferred?

3. Theorem 1 formally characterizes when the added hidden data can fully determine the SVM's decision boundary. Does a similar characterization exist for more complex models like neural networks? If not, how can we reason about the impact of hidden data in those cases? 

4. How does the choice of "task feature space" impact the effectiveness of the hidden training method for constructing robust model sequences? What properties should the feature space satisfy?

5. The greedy search algorithm selects subsequent model versions by estimating compound attack transferability against candidate models. What alternative search strategies could also be effective? How can the search space be characterized?

6. How does the choice of the attacker's capability (threat model) impact the construction of robust model sequences? For example, could the method defend against even stronger attacks than considered in the paper?

7. What theoretical guarantees can be provided regarding the robustness of the generated model sequence as its length grows? Can the increase in compound attack transferability be better bounded?

8. How well does the method scale to much larger and more complex datasets like ImageNet? What are the computational and data bottlenecks?

9. The method trains models from scratch in each version. Could the training be accelerated by fine-tuning prior versions or using weight inheritance? Would that impact robustness? 

10. How can the insights from the analysis be extended to other complex classifiers like random forests and gradient boosted trees? What components of the method fundamentally rely on differentiable models?
