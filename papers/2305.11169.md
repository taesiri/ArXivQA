# [Evidence of Meaning in Language Models Trained on Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11169)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: Can language models trained solely to predict the next token in a text corpus acquire meaningful semantic representations, despite having no explicit supervision for learning semantics? 

The two key hypotheses that the paper aims to investigate are:

H1: Language models trained only to perform next token prediction are fundamentally limited to repeating the surface-level statistical correlations in their training corpora. 

H2: Language models trained only on next token prediction are unable to assign meaning to the text they consume and generate.

The authors aim to test these hypotheses by training a Transformer language model on a corpus of programs, then probing the model's internal representations to see if they contain meaningful information aligned with program semantics. The central goal is to provide evidence for or against the view that language models can learn to represent meaning purely from textual form, even without any inductive bias or supervision for acquiring semantics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing evidence that language models can learn meaning despite being trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs. The key findings are:

- A linear probe is able to extract representations of program semantics, including future semantics, from the hidden states of a language model trained on a corpus of programs and specifications. The ability of the probe to extract semantics emerges in correlation with the model's ability to synthesize programs. 

- Through a novel interventional experiment that manipulates the semantics while preserving syntax, the authors show the semantic representations arise from the model states rather than being learned by the probe.

- The outputs of the model differ from the training distribution in semantically meaningful ways - specifically, the model tends to generate shorter, more concise programs than those in the training data.  

- More broadly, the paper presents a general framework for empirical research on meaning in language models based on ideas from programming language semantics. The use of programs enables precise definitions of concepts like correctness and semantics.

In summary, the paper provides evidence against the view that language models trained on predictive objectives like next token prediction are fundamentally limited to surface statistical patterns and cannot learn meaning. The results suggest that meaning can emerge in such models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents empirical evidence that language models can learn meaning despite being trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs, by probing the model's hidden states and evaluating the emergence of representations aligned with program semantics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents novel evidence for the emergence of meaning in language models (LMs) trained solely to predict the next token, rejecting prevailing hypotheses that LMs only reproduce surface statistics and cannot learn meaning. Prior work has probed LMs for meaningful representations, but this is the first to do so by training an LM on programs and probing for program semantics.

- It demonstrates a strong correlation between an LM's ability to generate correct programs and the emergence of semantic representations detectable by a linear probe. This goes beyond just probing a snapshot of the final LM, showing how meaning develops lockstep with generative abilities over training. 

- The paper introduces a new interventional technique to distinguish whether semantics are actually represented in the LM or an artifact of the probing method. By intervening on the semantics while preserving syntax, it provides stronger evidence that the semantics are encoded in the LM states.

- Analyzing the difference between the LM's outputs and training distribution is novel, revealing the LM can generate programs shorter than those it trained on. This semantically meaningful generalization is evidence against LMs just reproducing surface statistics.

- Overall, the formal perspective of using programming languages to precisely define meaning sets this work apart. It develops new techniques and insights that contribute to the debate on whether meaning can emerge in LMs. The results support that, contrary to some claims, meaning can be learned from form alone.

In summary, this paper makes several novel contributions over prior work by training LMs on programs, probing for program semantics, analyzing how meaning develops during training, designing interventional experiments, and identifying semantically meaningful generalization. The formal approach provides a principled way to investigate meaning in LMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few future research directions:

- Investigating the phenomenon of LMs generating programs shorter than those in the training set, and its implications for generalization. The authors point out that being able to reliably generate shorter, equivalent programs likely requires some semantic knowledge, but they leave a fuller exploration of this to future work.

- Applying the formal methods developed in this work, such as using program tracing as a model of meaning and designing semantic interventions, to study other concepts related to language and cognition in LMs. The authors believe their techniques offer a principled way to map concepts relevant to human language and intelligence more broadly onto the setting of LMs.

- Conducting further empirical research on whether semantics can emerge in LMs using the framework based on programming languages presented in this paper. The results here provide evidence that meaning can emerge, but the authors suggest more work could be done within this formal framework they have developed.

- Exploring whether the relationships observed between correctness, semantics, and perplexity/generalization hold for more complex programming languages and tasks. The simplified Karel language was used as an initial testbed, but applying a similar methodology to richer programming domains could yield additional insights.

In summary, the main future directions are: further investigating semantic generalization in LMs, extending their formal framework to study other aspects of meaning and cognition, conducting more empirical studies on semantic emergence within this framework, and scaling up the complexity of the programming language and tasks. The paper provides a formal foundation and initial results - future work can build on this to continue elucidating the semantic capabilities of LMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents evidence that language models can learn meaning despite being trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs. The authors train a Transformer model on a dataset of Karel programs paired with input-output examples. They then probe the model's hidden states as it generates programs to extract representations of program semantics, including future states corresponding to not-yet-generated tokens. The probe's ability to extract semantics emerges in lockstep with the model's accuracy at synthesizing programs over training. To show the semantics are represented in the model rather than learned by the probe, they define alternative semantics that exchange meanings of operations while preserving syntax and find degraded probe performance, indicating the model states align with the original semantics. They also find the model generates shorter, more efficient programs than those in the training set. Overall, the work presents evidence against views that language models only reproduce surface statistics of training data and cannot acquire meaning. The formal semantics of programs offers a way to precisely define and measure meaning and correctness during language model training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents evidence that language models can learn meaning despite being trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs. The authors train a Transformer model on a dataset of Karel programs paired with specifications in the form of input-output examples. They probe the trained model's hidden states as it generates a program given a new specification, and find that a linear classifier can extract abstract semantics tracking the input through execution as well as predictions of future semantics. The probe's ability to extract semantics correlates strongly with the model's accuracy at generating correct programs across training steps. Through an interventional experiment that changes the semantics while preserving syntax, the authors show the semantics are represented in the model states rather than learned by the probe. They also demonstrate the model generates shorter, more efficient programs than those in the training set, suggesting meaningful generalization beyond surface statistics. Overall, the results provide evidence against the view that language models trained on form alone cannot acquire meaning. The formal approach offers insights into representations of meaning in language models.

In more detail, the authors train a Transformer language model on a corpus of Karel programs, specifications, and execution traces. They periodically evaluate the model's ability to synthesize programs and the extent to which linear probes can extract semantic abstractions from the model's hidden states. The semantic content of the model states undergoes a phase transition during training that correlates strongly with program synthesis accuracy. The authors also show the model represents semantics for ungenerated future tokens. Through an interventional experiment that manipulates the semantics while preserving lexical and syntactic form, they demonstrate the semantics are inherent to the model states rather than learned by the probes. Analyzing the model's outputs reveals it generates shorter, more efficient programs than the training set. Taken together, the results provide evidence that language models can learn meaning from predicting token sequences alone. The formal semantic framework offers new techniques for investigating meaning in language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper trains a Transformer language model on a corpus of Karel programs, where each program is preceded by a specification in the form of input-output examples. After training the model to perform next token prediction on this corpus, the authors probe the model's hidden states as it generates programs from novel specifications. They train linear classifiers to predict aspects of the program state, such as the robot's facing direction, from the model's hidden states. This allows them to quantify the "semantic content" of the model's representations over the course of training. They find that the semantic content, as measured by the probing classifiers, increases in lockstep with the model's accuracy at generating correct programs from specifications. The authors also perform interventions by changing the semantics of the programming language while keeping the syntax fixed, which enables them to determine whether the semantics are encoded in the model states versus learned separately by the probing classifiers. Overall, the probing method allows the authors to demonstrate that, despite no explicit supervision, the language model learns to represent semantic aspects of the programs purely through next token prediction.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether large language models (LMs) trained only to predict the next token are able to learn semantic meaning and go beyond capturing surface statistical patterns in the training data. Specifically, the two main hypotheses the paper aims to investigate are:

H1: LMs are fundamentally limited to repeating the surface-level statistical correlations in their training corpora. 

H2: LMs are unable to assign meaning to the text they consume and generate.

The authors aim to provide empirical evidence to evaluate these hypotheses and contribute insights into whether meaning can emerge in LMs trained solely via next token prediction on text corpora.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that working with programs enables defining concepts like correctness and semantics precisely. How much of the conclusions depend on the precise formal semantics of programs versus natural language? Could similar methods be applied to more informal domains like commonsense reasoning? 

2. The facing direction abstraction is used to extract an aspect of the full trace semantics from the model states. How does the choice of abstraction impact the conclusions? Would using a less precise abstraction change the interpretation of the results?

3. The paper finds a strong correlation between generative accuracy and semantic content. Could this just be because both metrics improve with model scale/training, rather than evidence of a direct relationship? How could this be tested more rigorously?

4. The interventional experiment with alternative semantics is clever, but requires carefully designing the intervention. What are the limitations of this approach? Could a poorly chosen alternative semantics fail to distinguish the hypotheses?

5. The results show the model generates shorter programs than the training set. Does this actually require real generalization beyond the training distribution? Could it be explained by simpler biases?

6. How surprising is the result that perplexity on training data remains high? Doesn't model likelihood often not correlate well with downstream performance? What specifically does this add to the overall conclusions?

7. The paper probes for linear representations of semantics in model states. How does this restrict the conclusions about what meaning has been acquired? Could nonlinear relationships exist?

8. What are possible alternative explanations for the results, besides the one offered about learning meaning? How thoroughly were other hypotheses tested?

9. How unique is program synthesis as a testbed for studying meaning? Would similar methods work for other domains like QA, summarization, dialogue, etc.?

10. The paper focuses on model states, but how does attention distribution, gradient flow, or other aspects of model behavior relate to the acquisition of meaning?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new experimental framework for studying meaning in language models based on program semantics. How does framing the problem in terms of program semantics and trace semantics allow for a more precise definition and measurement of concepts related to meaning?

2. The paper trains a language model on a corpus of Karel programs paired with input-output specifications. What advantages does using programs provide over training directly on natural language text when investigating whether language models can learn meaning?

3. The paper probes the trained language model's hidden states using a linear classifier to predict properties of the program state like the robot's facing direction. Why is a linear probe well-suited for extracting semantic properties, and what does the performance of the probe indicate about the information contained in the hidden states? 

4. The paper finds a strong correlation between the language model's generative accuracy and the ability of a linear probe to extract semantic properties from the hidden states. Why does this suggest that learning to generate correct programs is directly related to learning program semantics?
