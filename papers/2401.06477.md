# [Kun: Answer Polishment for Chinese Self-Alignment with Instruction   Back-Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lack of high-quality Chinese instruction tuning datasets for improving large language models (LLMs). Existing datasets have issues like limited scope, poor quality, restrictions, insufficient coverage.
- Current methods for generating instruction data rely heavily on expensive and time-consuming manual annotations, not scalable.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduces Kun, a novel self-training algorithm to leverage over 1 million quality Chinese instructional data points from diverse unlabeled sources like Wudao, Wanjuan and SkyPile.
- Core innovation is Answer Polishment (AP) technique to refine raw unlabeled data into coherent instruction-output pairs. Ensures tighter correlation between instructions and responses.  
- Creates label model and primary chat model using seed dataset. Label model generates candidate instructions from unlabeled data. Primary chat model evaluates and refines the labeled data for quality.
- Iterative training of primary chat model with refined quality data produces high performing final chat model.

Main Contributions:
- Algorithmic Advancement via AP that enhances data retention, resolves ambiguities. Expands pool of quality data. 
- Innovative data generation approach that reduces reliance on manual annotations. Produces over 1 million diverse Chinese instructional data points.

Experiments and Results:
- Uses 6B parameter Yi model, tests on benchmarks like C-EVAL, CMMLU and human evaluation.
- Kun model variants demonstrate robust performance across evaluations. Kun-52k emerges as top performer based on results.
- Approach is scalable and efficient solution to improve instruction-following capabilities of LLMs with implications for diverse applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Kun, a novel self-training algorithm that leverages over a million quality Chinese instructional data points from diverse sources to effectively improve the instruction-following capabilities of large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Kun, a novel approach for creating high-quality instruction-tuning datasets for large language models (LLMs) without relying on manual annotations. The key contributions are:

1. Algorithmic Advancement: The method introduces Answer Polishment (AP) which enhances data retention and resolves ambiguities in the raw data, leading to an expanded pool of high-quality data for fine-tuning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a self-training algorithm that includes a process called "Answer Polishment" (AP). Can you explain in more detail how AP works and why it is important for refining the quality of the instruction-output pairs? 

2. The paper generates candidate instruction-output pairs by using a "label model" to infer candidate instructions for unlabeled output segments. What are some of the key challenges in ensuring the quality of the instructions generated by the label model? How does the paper address these challenges?

3. The paper compares two different methods for filtering the candidate labeled data - comprehensive scoring versus focused scoring of just the instruction component. Why is focused scoring more effective for retaining high quality data?

4. What are some of the key hyperparameter settings and implementation details in terms of the fine-tuning process? How were these hyperparameters optimized and how might they impact model performance?

5. The human evaluation results highlight the superiority of the Kun-360k model. What specific qualities or capabilities of this model, trained on the curated dataset, contribute to its strong performance?  

6. The paper utilizes the Yi-6B model as the foundation and benchmarks performance against other dataset-model combinations. How might the results differ if a different base model was used instead?

7. The curated dataset incorporates sources like Wudao, Wanjuan and Skypile. What is unique about each source and what prepossessing steps were taken before using this data?

8. What are some of the limitations of the evaluation methods used in the paper? What additional benchmarks or evaluations could further validate the quality of the models? 

9. The paper mentions optimizing for a balance between computational efficiency and model performance in the fine-tuning process. What are some ways these two goals could be balanced differently?
