# [First Order Quantum Phase Transition in the Hybrid Metal-Mott Insulator   Transition Metal Dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.1447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: What is the nature of the electronic phases and phase transitions in the hybrid transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2, which interleaves layers of metallic 1H-TaS2 and Mott insulating 1T-TaS2?Some key points:- The paper investigates the electronic properties of 4Hb-TaS2 using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). - It finds two distinct electronic ground states coexisting in 4Hb-TaS2 - a Kondo cluster state and a depleted flat band state. - It shows these two states can be reversibly switched via a first-order quantum phase transition induced by temperature, electric field, and STM tip manipulation.- The phase transition line in the temperature-voltage phase diagram has a characteristic quadratic shape determined by the compressibility and entropy differences between the two phases. - The Kondo cluster state is favored by its higher compressibility while the flat band state has higher entropy.So in summary, the central research question is characterizing the nature of the electronic phases and phase transitions in this hybrid metal-Mott insulator system of 4Hb-TaS2 using STM/STS. The key finding is the coexistence and transition between the Kondo and flat band states.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- It investigates the compound 4Hb-TaS2 that hybridizes the Mott-insulating state of 1T-TaS2 with the metallic state of 2H-TaS2. - It reveals a thermodynamic phase diagram in 4Hb-TaS2 that hosts a first order quantum phase transition between a correlated Kondo cluster state and a flat band state where the Kondo cluster becomes depleted.- It shows that this intrinsic transition can be induced and manipulated by electric field, temperature, and tuning the interlayer coupling with the STM tip. This allows reversibly switching between the Kondo cluster and flat band states.- The shape of the transition line in the phase diagram is determined by the local compressibility and entropy differences between the two electronic states.- The findings demonstrate that heterogeneous van der Waals structures like 4Hb-TaS2 provide an exciting platform to study and manipulate quantum phase transitions between correlated electronic states.In summary, the key contribution is revealing and characterizing an electric field-driven quantum phase transition between a Kondo cluster state and a depleted flat band state in the hybrid metal-Mott insulator 4Hb-TaS2 using spectroscopic imaging. This demonstrates the potential of such heterogeneous structures for investigating transitions among strongly correlated phases.
