# [First Order Quantum Phase Transition in the Hybrid Metal-Mott Insulator   Transition Metal Dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.1447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: What is the nature of the electronic phases and phase transitions in the hybrid transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2, which interleaves layers of metallic 1H-TaS2 and Mott insulating 1T-TaS2?

Some key points:

- The paper investigates the electronic properties of 4Hb-TaS2 using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). 

- It finds two distinct electronic ground states coexisting in 4Hb-TaS2 - a Kondo cluster state and a depleted flat band state. 

- It shows these two states can be reversibly switched via a first-order quantum phase transition induced by temperature, electric field, and STM tip manipulation.

- The phase transition line in the temperature-voltage phase diagram has a characteristic quadratic shape determined by the compressibility and entropy differences between the two phases. 

- The Kondo cluster state is favored by its higher compressibility while the flat band state has higher entropy.

So in summary, the central research question is characterizing the nature of the electronic phases and phase transitions in this hybrid metal-Mott insulator system of 4Hb-TaS2 using STM/STS. The key finding is the coexistence and transition between the Kondo and flat band states.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- It investigates the compound 4Hb-TaS2 that hybridizes the Mott-insulating state of 1T-TaS2 with the metallic state of 2H-TaS2. 

- It reveals a thermodynamic phase diagram in 4Hb-TaS2 that hosts a first order quantum phase transition between a correlated Kondo cluster state and a flat band state where the Kondo cluster becomes depleted.

- It shows that this intrinsic transition can be induced and manipulated by electric field, temperature, and tuning the interlayer coupling with the STM tip. This allows reversibly switching between the Kondo cluster and flat band states.

- The shape of the transition line in the phase diagram is determined by the local compressibility and entropy differences between the two electronic states.

- The findings demonstrate that heterogeneous van der Waals structures like 4Hb-TaS2 provide an exciting platform to study and manipulate quantum phase transitions between correlated electronic states.

In summary, the key contribution is revealing and characterizing an electric field-driven quantum phase transition between a Kondo cluster state and a depleted flat band state in the hybrid metal-Mott insulator 4Hb-TaS2 using spectroscopic imaging. This demonstrates the potential of such heterogeneous structures for investigating transitions among strongly correlated phases.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- The study investigates the hybrid metal-Mott insulator material 4Hb-TaS2, which combines alternating layers of the Mott insulator 1T-TaS2 and the metal 1H-TaS2. This builds on previous work looking at hybrid systems of distinct electronic phases, such as interfaces between oxides and Mott insulators. However, this specific material system of coupled transition metal dichalcogenides is relatively new.

- The paper reports the observation of a first order quantum phase transition between a Kondo cluster state and a depleted flat band state in 4Hb-TaS2. This phase transition can be induced by temperature, electric field, and STM tip interactions. The study of phase transitions in this hybrid material is novel. Previous work showedKondo behavior or depleted flat bands, but not the transition between them.

- The phase transition is characterized through detailed spectroscopic imaging and analysis of the electronic structure on both sides. This provides insights into the competing energetics, specifically the compressibility and entropy differences between the two phases. Detailed characterization of a quantum phase transition in this system has not been done before. 

- The paper also speculates on the potential relation between the observed electronic phases/transition and the superconducting state in 4Hb-TaS2 based on comparisons to previous measurements. This may provide context for understanding the unconventional superconductivity, though more work is needed to establish direct connections.

In summary, this work provides new insights into phase transitions in a relatively unexplored hybrid metal-Mott insulator system using advanced scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques and analysis. It reveals new phenomena not seen before in similar hybrids. The detailed characterization of the quantum phase transition is a central novel contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further investigating the origin and nature of the "dim" CDW sites that exhibit the Kondo resonance. The authors suggest these may be related to Se defects or intercalation, but the exact chemical origin is still unclear. Understanding this could allow systematically tuning the Kondo cluster density.

- Exploring how the electronic phase diagram and quantum phase transition evolves by gradually changing the concentration of Kondo sites, which could provide insights into the onset of correlated phases.

- Clarifying whether the quantum phase transition temperature coincides with the bulk superconducting Tc by design or coincidence, and if there are any causal connections between the Kondo cluster state and superconductivity.

- Using the tip-tuning to further study the competing energy scales and hysteresis across the first-order transition.

- Investigating if the Kondo cluster state could provide an alternative explanation for previous observations like enhanced Muon relaxation below Tc.

- Comparing to other hybrid metal-Mott systems like artificially grown 1T/1H bilayers to understand the role of commensurability in determining if a uniform Kondo lattice or mixed phase is realized.

- Exploring if other methods beyond STM like transport or optics can probe this first-order transition.

- Examining how the phase competition evolves with interlayer separation, stacking configurations, pressure, doping, etc.

So in summary, the authors point to many intriguing future directions leveraging this system to gain insights into correlated physics, quantum phase transitions, and properties of hybrid metal-Mott phases. Systematically tuning the Kondo cluster density and studying competeting ground states and their connections to superconductivity seem particularly interesting.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper investigates the hybrid metal-Mott insulator transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2, which consists of alternating layers of 1T-TaS2 (Mott insulator) and 2H-TaS2 (metal). The key findings are:

1. On most charge density wave (CDW) sites, the spectrum shows a depleted flat band above the Fermi level due to charge transfer from the 1T to the 2H layer. 

2. On about 12% of "dim" CDW sites, a Kondo-like resonance peak is observed, forming a Kondo cluster state.

3. Spectroscopic imaging reveals an abrupt first-order quantum phase transition between the Kondo cluster state and the depleted flat band state, induced by temperature, electric field, and tip-sample interaction. 

4. The shape of the transition line in the phase diagram is determined by the local compressibility and entropy differences between the two phases.

5. The transition can be repeatedly toggled by the STM tip, electric field, and temperature, allowing reversible switching between the Kondo and flat band states.

In summary, the paper demonstrates tunable quantum phase transitions between exotic correlated states in a hybrid Mott insulator-metal dichalcogenide, revealing a rich phase diagram with potential for novel electronic orders.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper reports on the discovery of a first order quantum phase transition between two electronic ground states in the hybrid metal-Mott insulator transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2. The compound consists of alternating layers of metallic 1H-TaS2 and Mott insulating 1T-TaS2 which are coupled by van der Waals interaction. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the authors find that the majority of the 1T-TaS2 charge density wave sites exhibit a depleted flat band spectrum resulting from charge transfer to the 1H-TaS2 layer. However, a small fraction (~12%) of "dim" sites retain a symmetric Kondo-like resonance. By varying temperature, electric field, and tip-sample interaction, an abrupt reversible transition between the Kondo cluster state and the flat band state could be induced on these sites. Analysis of the transition suggests it is a first order quantum phase transition whose line shape is determined by the relative entropy and compressibility of the two phases. The Kondo cluster state favors low temperature and negative bias while the flat band state is entropically stabilized at higher temperatures. Hysteresis and low frequency noise were observed, indicating mesoscale correlations beyond single sites.

In summary, this work demonstrates a new type of tunable quantum phase transition between competing many-body ground states in a hybrid metal-Mott insulator. The ability to manipulate and switch between the Kondo screened and depleted Mott phases using temperature, voltage, and AFM tips provides opportunities to systematically study transitions between exotic many-body states. The mesoscale correlations revealed by noise measurements also suggest potential glassy behavior emerging from the competition between these two phases.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) on single crystals of the transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2. The authors use STM/STS to image the charge density wave structure and measure the local density of states on the surface. By measuring the differential conductance (dI/dV) as a function of sample bias voltage and position, they are able to map out the electronic structure with high spatial and energy resolution. 

The key findings from the STM/STS measurements are:

1. On most charge density wave sites, the density of states shows an asymmetric peak above the Fermi level, corresponding to depleted flat bands shifted upwards in energy. This is attributed to charge transfer from the 1T-TaS2 layer to the adjacent 1H-TaS2 layer. 

2. On some "dim" charge density wave sites (~12%), a zero-bias conductance peak characteristic of a Kondo resonance is observed instead. This suggests localized electron states that become screened by the adjacent metal layer.

3. By varying temperature and bias voltage, the authors demonstrate an abrupt transition between the Kondo and depleted flat band spectra. This transition can also be induced reversibly by changing the tip-sample distance.

4. The transition exhibits signatures of a first-order quantum phase transition, including hysteresis. The shape of the transition line in the voltage-temperature phase diagram can be explained by a model involving the relative compressibility and entropy of the two phases.

In summary, STM/STS allows direct imaging of the electronic structure and manipulation of phase transitions between distinct many-body ground states in this hybrid metal-Mott insulator system.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main problem this paper is addressing is how to induce and study novel electronic orders and phase transitions by coupling distinct correlated and topologically non-trivial electronic phases of matter. Specifically, the authors are investigating the compound 4Hb-TaS2, which interleaves the Mott-insulating state of 1T-TaS2 and the putative spin liquid it hosts together with the metallic state of 2H-TaS2 and the low temperature superconducting phase it harbors. By studying this hybrid system, the authors aim to gain insights into phase transitions between a correlated Kondo cluster state and a flat band state.

Some key aspects the paper is focused on:

- Characterizing two distinct ground states observed in 4Hb-TaS2 - a Kondo cluster state and a depleted flat band state. 

- Demonstrating a reversible first-order quantum phase transition between these two states induced by temperature, electric field, and STM tip manipulation.

- Mapping out the thermodynamic phase diagram and investigating the evolution of the transition across temperature, electric field, and tip-sample interaction axes.

- Elucidating the competing energetics, specifically the local compressibility and entropy, that determine the shape of the transition line in the phase diagram.

- Discussing how coupling a Mott insulator to a metal in this hybrid system provides opportunities to study transitions between correlated phases and induce novel electronic orders.

In summary, the key problem is using the hybrid 4Hb-TaS2 system to induce and systematically investigate electronic phase transitions between distinct correlated states, which could provide insights into fundamental questions about Mott-metal transitions and quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated phases.
