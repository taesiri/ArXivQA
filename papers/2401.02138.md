# [Explore Human Parsing Modality for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02138)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for human action recognition use either a single modality like skeletons or RGB images, which have limitations. Skeletons lack appearance information while RGB images suffer from noise.
- Multimodal methods combining skeletons and RGB images also have drawbacks due to issues with the RGB modality.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new modality - human parsing feature maps which are noiseless and retain crucial body part information.
- Propose a dual-branch framework called Ensemble Human Parsing and Pose Network (EPP-Net) which leverages both skeleton data and human parsing feature maps for robust action recognition.

- The framework has two branches:
   1) Human pose branch that takes in skeleton data, converts it to graph representations and uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract features and classification scores.
   2) Human parsing branch that constructs feature maps from RGB frames using a human parser, and applies CNN blocks for high-level feature extraction.

- The classification scores from both branches are fused via a late fusion strategy to improve recognition performance.

Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce human parsing as a novel modality for action recognition which is noise-robust and retains important body part details.  

- A new dual-branch EPP-Net framework proposed which combines both skeletons and human parsing feature maps using GCN and CNN branches respectively.

- Evaluation on NTU-RGB+D and NTU-RGB+D 120 datasets shows state-of-the-art performance demonstrating the efficacy of the introduced parsing modality and the proposed multimodal fusion framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a dual-branch framework called Ensemble Human Parsing and Pose Network (EPP-Net) that introduces human parsing feature maps as a novel modality combined with skeleton data for more robust human action recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It advocates leveraging human parsing feature maps as a novel modality for multimodal-based action recognition. The introduced human parsing modality is depictive and can filter out most irrelevant noise. 

2. It proposes a new dual-branch framework called Ensemble Human Parsing and Pose Network (EPP-Net), which effectively combines human parsing feature maps and pose modality for the first time. The skeleton data and feature maps are inputted to GCN and CNN backbones for modeling high-level features, which are then effectively combined through a late fusion strategy.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on benchmark NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed EPP-Net. The results show that EPP-Net outperforms most existing unimodal and multimodal methods for action recognition.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and utilization of a new human parsing modality in a dual-branch ensemble framework for more robust multimodal-based action recognition.

The paper proposes an Ensemble Human Parsing and Pose Network (EPP-Net) for multimodal-based action recognition. The key ideas include:

- Introducing human parsing feature maps as a novel modality that is depictive and noiseless for representing human actions, in contrast to noisy RGB images. 

- An ensemble framework with two branches - a human pose branch that processes skeleton data via GCNs, and a human parsing branch that processes human parsing feature maps via CNNs. 

- Late fusion strategy to combine the classification scores from the two branches.

- Evaluated on NTU-RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 benchmark datasets for human action recognition.

In summary, the key terms revolve around fusing human parsing and pose modalities for robust multimodal action recognition.
