# [Evolving Rewards to Automate Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07628)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether AutoRL, an automated reward tuning method, can improve reinforcement learning performance on continuous control tasks compared to hand-tuned or hyperparameter-tuned baselines. Specifically, the authors evaluate AutoRL on four MuJoCo continuous control environments (Ant, Walker, Humanoid Standup, and Humanoid) using two RL algorithms (SAC and PPO). They optimize parameterized versions of the standard environment rewards (proxy rewards) with two objectives: metric-based single-task objectives like distance traveled, and the multi-objective standard returns typically used. The key hypotheses tested are:

1) Can AutoRL find better proxy rewards that train policies superior to hand-tuned and hyperparameter-tuned baselines on the given objectives? 

2) Can optimizing for simpler single-task objectives produce comparable performance to carefully hand-tuned multi-objective standard returns?

3) Under a limited training budget, is tuning the proxy rewards more beneficial than just tuning RL hyperparameters?

The experiments aim to demonstrate AutoRL's ability to automate and improve upon reward design for continuous control tasks using evolutionary optimization. The results on the four MuJoCo environments and two RL algorithms validate the hypotheses, showing AutoRL's benefits especially for more complex environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is applying an evolutionary layer called AutoRL over standard reinforcement learning algorithms to automate reward tuning and find better rewards for continuous control tasks. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Applies AutoRL to optimize parameterized rewards on 4 Mujoco continuous control tasks using Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). 

- Compares optimizing rewards over single-task objectives like distance traveled vs multi-objective standard environment returns.

- Shows that evolving rewards leads to better policies than hand-tuned or hyperparameter-tuned baselines, especially on more complex tasks.

- Finds that optimizing over simpler single-task objectives produces comparable performance to carefully hand-tuned standard returns.

- Shows reward tuning finds better policies faster than just tuning hyperparameters under a limited training budget.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that an automated evolutionary approach to reward design can reduce manual engineering effort and improve results over baselines on continuous control tasks. The AutoRL layer is shown to be an effective way to automate and improve reward design for RL.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes AutoRL, an automated technique to evolve reward functions for reinforcement learning agents to improve training stability, sample efficiency, and final policy performance, especially on complex continuous control tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of automating reinforcement learning:

- The approach taken in this paper of treating reward design as a hyperparameter optimization problem is fairly novel. Most prior work has focused on automating other aspects of RL like neural network architecture search. Treating the reward function as a tunable parameter is an interesting idea.

- This paper applies evolutionary methods (specifically Gaussian process bandits) to optimize the reward, whereas some prior AutoRL work has used RL or evolutionary algorithms directly on policy parameters. Using evolution to optimize the reward while using standard RL algorithms to learn policies is a less common technique.

- The paper aims to show that automatic reward tuning can improve performance on continuous control tasks with standard RL algorithms like SAC and PPO. Some other papers have studied reward search but mainly in simpler or custom environments. Demonstrating this on standard benchmarks like Mujoco tasks is useful.

- A key finding is that optimizing for a single-task objective metric can produce comparable performance to hand-designed complex reward functions. This suggests reward search could reduce human effort in specifying rewards. However, a limitation is that only metric-based objectives were tested rather than true sparse goals.

- Compared to hyperparameter tuning, the paper finds reward tuning can more efficiently find high-performing policies under a fixed training budget. This is noteworthy, suggesting reward design should get more attention compared to just tuning hyperparameters.

In summary, the core ideas of automatically tuning the reward function with evolution while using off-the-shelf RL algorithms are fairly novel. The paper makes useful contributions in benchmarking this approach on common continuous control tasks and showing benefits over reward hand-tuning and hyperparameter search. The techniques seem promising for making RL training more automated and efficient.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Applying AutoRL to other RL algorithms beyond PPO and SAC evaluated in this paper. The authors suggest AutoRL could be beneficial when combined with other on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms.

- Testing AutoRL on more complex and high-dimensional continuous control tasks. The results showed larger gains for AutoRL on the most complex Humanoid task, so the authors suggest it could provide even greater benefits on other complex control problems.

- Using AutoRL for true multi-objective optimization, rather than optimizing a scalarized reward as done in this paper. The authors propose applying AutoRL to problems with multiple competing objectives.

- Combining AutoRL with other methods like curriculum learning and pre-training. The authors suggest AutoRL could complement other techniques for improving RL training.

- Further analysis comparing reward tuning to hyperparameter tuning under a limited training budget. The results showed reward tuning explores better policies, so more in-depth analysis of this is proposed.

- Applications of AutoRL beyond simulation, such as real-world robotics tasks. The authors suggest evaluating how well AutoRL's automated reward tuning transfers to real-world settings.

- Analysis of what proxy rewards AutoRL learns, to provide insights into effective reward shaping. The authors propose studying what AutoRL discovers through its automated search process.

In summary, the main directions are applying AutoRL more broadly across RL algorithms, tasks, and problem settings, as well as further analysis of how and why automated reward tuning provides benefits. The authors position AutoRL as a general approach to help automate and improve RL training.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents AutoRL, a method that automates reward design in reinforcement learning (RL) using evolutionary optimization. The key idea is to treat reward tuning as a hyperparameter optimization problem. Specifically, AutoRL optimizes a parameterized reward function to maximize a given task objective metric. It trains a population of RL agents in parallel, each with a different reward parameterization. It then selects new reward parameters to try based on the results so far using Gaussian process bandits. 

The method is evaluated on continuous control tasks in Mujoco environments using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experiments optimize both simple task-specific metrics (e.g. distance traveled) and the standard multi-objective rewards for each environment. Results show that AutoRL outperforms hand-tuned and hyperparameter-tuned baselines, especially on more complex tasks. Evolving simple task-specific rewards produces comparable performance to hand-designed multi-objective rewards, reducing engineering effort. Overall, the results demonstrate that automatically evolving rewards can improve RL performance and reduce the need for manual reward tuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents AutoRL, an automated approach for designing rewards in reinforcement learning tasks. The key idea is to use evolutionary optimization to learn proxy reward functions that maximize a given task objective metric. 

Specifically, AutoRL runs a population of RL agents in parallel, each trained with a different parameterized reward function. The parameters of these reward functions are evolved over generations using an evolutionary algorithm to maximize theagents' performance on the true task objective metric. This allows AutoRL to automatically find good proxy reward functions that make training easier and produce better policies compared to using the raw task metric directly as the reward.

The authors evaluate AutoRL on continuous control tasks using MuJoCo environments and SAC and PPO RL algorithms. The results show that AutoRL is able to optimize proxy rewards that outperform hand-tuned and hyperparameter-optimized baselines, especially on more complex tasks. Evolving simple single-objective rewards produces comparable performance to multi-objective rewards designed by hand. Overall, AutoRL reduces the need for manual reward tuning while improving training stability, data efficiency, and final policy quality.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the challenge of reward design in reinforcement learning (RL). Hand-designing good rewards for RL agents is tedious and requires a lot of trial and error.

- The authors propose a method called AutoRL that automates reward design by treating it as a hyperparameter optimization problem. It evolves rewards over generations of RL agents to find rewards that maximize a given task objective.

- AutoRL is evaluated on continuous control tasks using MuJoCo environments like Ant, Walker, Humanoid etc. over two RL algorithms - SAC and PPO.

- The results show AutoRL can learn better policies than hand-tuned or hyperparameter-tuned baselines, especially on more complex tasks like Humanoid. The biggest gains are seen when optimizing for a simple metric-based task objective versus the standard multi-objective reward.

- AutoRL reduces the need for careful manual tuning of complex multi-objective rewards. The simpler metric-based objectives it optimizes for lead to comparable performance. This suggests AutoRL can automate a significant portion of reward design.

- Under a fixed training budget, AutoRL is more likely to find good policies than just tuning RL hyperparameters. This suggests rewarding tuning should take priority over hyperparameter tuning.

In summary, the paper is addressing the challenge of automating the reward design process for RL agents to reduce manual engineering and improve performance. The proposed AutoRL method shows promising results on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.
