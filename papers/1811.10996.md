# [CGMH: Constrained Sentence Generation by Metropolis-Hastings Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10996)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform constrained sentence generation, where the generated sentences satisfy certain requirements like containing specified keywords. The key hypothesis is that constrained sentence generation can be effectively achieved by using Metropolis-Hastings sampling to sample sentences from a distribution defined to satisfy the constraints.

The paper proposes a novel method called CGMH (Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings sampling) to tackle constrained sentence generation. The core idea is to use Metropolis-Hastings, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, to sample sentences from a desired distribution where sentences satisfying the constraints have higher probability. The paper shows this framework can handle both hard constraints like mandatory keywords as well as soft constraints like semantic similarity.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that Metropolis-Hastings sampling provides an effective approach to constrained sentence generation by allowing flexible manipulation of the sampling distribution to satisfy different constraints. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on tasks like keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised paraphrasing, and error correction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CGMH, a novel framework for constrained sentence generation using Metropolis-Hastings sampling. The key points are:

- CGMH allows imposing both hard constraints (e.g. mandatory keywords) and soft constraints (e.g. semantic similarity) on the generated sentences. This is flexible and enables many applications.

- CGMH works in the inference stage without requiring parallel training data. It directly samples sentences from a specified stationary distribution. 

- The paper shows CGMH's effectiveness on three tasks: keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised paraphrase generation, and unsupervised error correction. CGMH achieves strong performance compared to previous supervised methods.

- The paper provides in-depth analysis on the acceptance rate, effect of initial states, and comparison with VAE sampling. This gives insights into the sampling process.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CGMH framework and demonstrating its flexibility for constrained sentence generation, without requiring supervised parallel data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a novel approach called Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings (CGMH) sampling for constrained natural language generation, which can handle both hard constraints like mandatory keywords and soft constraints like semantic similarity through flexible manipulation of the stationary distribution in Metropolis-Hastings sampling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in constrained sentence generation:

- It proposes a new method called CGMH (Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings sampling) that can handle both hard constraints (e.g. mandatory keywords) and soft constraints (e.g. semantic similarity) during sentence generation. Most prior work focuses on either hard or soft constraints, but not both.

- CGMH works at inference time and does not require parallel training data. Many previous approaches for constrained generation rely on neural models trained on parallel corpora, which can be difficult to obtain. CGMH is more flexible.

- It shows strong performance on keyword-to-sentence generation, unsupervised paraphrase generation, and unsupervised error correction. The model outperforms prior supervised methods on some tasks and achieves comparable results on others.

- CGMH directly samples full sentences instead of generating word-by-word left-to-right like RNNs. This makes it easier to satisfy constraints that involve multiple words.

- The paper demonstrates unsupervised learning for paraphrase and error correction, which has been done in a supervised fashion before. This is an interesting extension of the capabilities of the model.

- Compared to sampling from the latent space of variational autoencoders, CGMH appears to generate more diverse sentences and does not suffer as much from accumulation of errors.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel sampling-based approach for constrained sentence generation that is flexible, achieves strong performance, and enables unsupervised learning on new tasks. The comparisons on diversity and error accumulation vs VAEs are also insightful.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing proper heuristics to manipulate the stationary distribution in the CGMH framework to further improve performance on paraphrase generation. The authors note that currently their model generates paraphrases that are quite close to the original sentences in terms of BLEU score against the original sentences. Designing techniques to make the paraphrases more diverse while preserving meaning could be an interesting avenue for future work.

- Exploring conditional sampling for the MH framework to allow imposing further constraints and controlling certain attributes of the generated sentences. The authors suggest conditional sampling could potentially help guide the sampling process.

- Applying the CGMH framework to other language generation tasks beyond the ones explored in the paper, such as dialogue response generation and story generation. The flexibility of the framework makes it promising for other generation applications with constraints.

- Speeding up the mixing/burn-in time of the Markov chain in the MH sampling process to make it more efficient. The authors note it currently takes around 150 steps to generate a fluent sentence from keywords, so improving efficiency could help scale it up.

- Combining the benefits of CGMH sampling from the sentence space with VAE sampling from the latent space. The authors suggest combining the two complementary approaches could be an interesting direction.

- Exploring other choices of proposals and stationary distributions for different applications within the overall CGMH framework. The authors emphasize the flexibility of their framework for these design choices.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving diversity and efficiency of the CGMH approach, extending it to other applications, and combining it with other generation methods like VAEs. The core CGMH framework offers flexibility for researchers to build on in many ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings (CGMH) for constrained sentence generation. CGMH utilizes Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling to generate sentences that satisfy specified constraints. It defines word-level operations like replacement, insertion, and deletion as proposals in the MH algorithm. The stationary distribution of the Markov chain is designed to reflect constraints such as keyword inclusion, semantic similarity to input, etc. CGMH allows flexible manipulation of the stationary distribution to impose hard or soft constraints. It does not require parallel corpora for training like previous methods. CGMH is applied to keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised paraphrase generation, and unsupervised error correction. It achieves high performance close to supervised approaches in these tasks. CGMH also enables unsupervised learning in applications where labeled data is unavailable. The flexibility of CGMH makes it a general framework for constrained sentence generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings sampling (CGMH) for constrained sentence generation. CGMH allows generating sentences that satisfy both hard constraints, such as the inclusion of certain keywords, as well as soft constraints, such as semantic similarity to a source sentence. 

CGMH works by defining a Markov chain over the space of sentences. The stationary distribution of this Markov chain is designed to assign higher probability to sentences that satisfy the constraints. Local transitions in the Markov chain are performed by word replacement, insertion and deletion. Experiments on keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised paraphrase generation, and unsupervised error correction show that CGMH can impose constraints effectively while generating fluent sentences. The model achieves strong performance compared to previous approaches including variational autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and grid beam search. A key advantage of CGMH is the capability for unsupervised learning, removing the requirement for parallel training corpora needed by existing supervised methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings (CGMH), a novel approach for constrained sentence generation using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling. MH defines local word-level operations on sentences such as replacement, insertion, and deletion to transition between different sentence states. During sampling, a proposal is generated by randomly selecting a word and an operation. The proposal is then accepted or rejected according to a pre-specified acceptance rate that depends on the desired stationary distribution. The key advantage of CGMH is its flexibility in imposing constraints on the generated sentences. Both hard constraints like mandatory keywords and soft constraints like semantic similarity can be incorporated into the stationary distribution. This allows CGMH to tackle applications like keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised paraphrase generation, and unsupervised error correction. Without parallel training data, CGMH achieves high performance comparable to supervised methods in these tasks. Overall, the CGMH framework provides an effective way to perform constrained sampling directly in the sentence space.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new approach called Constrained Generation by Metropolis-Hastings (CGMH) for natural language generation with constraints on the output sentences. The constraints can be hard constraints like mandatory keywords, or soft constraints like requiring semantic similarity to a source sentence. 

The main problem the paper aims to address is that existing neural network-based methods for text generation, like RNNs, have difficulty imposing constraints during the left-to-right generative process. Methods like grid beam search can incorporate hard constraints like keywords, but perform poorly on more general sentence generation tasks with a huge search space.

The key insight of the paper is to formulate constrained sentence generation as sampling from a distribution over sentences defined by the constraints. They use Metropolis-Hastings, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to sample sentences that satisfy the constraints. The constraints are encoded into the stationary distribution that the sampler converges to.

In summary, the key problem is imposing different kinds of constraints during open-ended sentence generation, which existing neural methods struggle with. The paper proposes a flexible sampling framework CGMH to sample constrained sentences from desired distributions.
