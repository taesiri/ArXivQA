# [Aligning GPTRec with Beyond-Accuracy Goals with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Sequential recommendation models work well for optimizing accuracy but struggle with complex beyond-accuracy goals like diversity. This is because they score items independently using a score-and-rank (Top-K) strategy.
- Recently, the GPTRec model was proposed that uses a generative next-item (Next-K) strategy instead. This considers inter-item dependencies and is better suited for beyond-accuracy goals. However, GPTRec has only been optimized for accuracy. 

Proposed Solution:
- A 2-stage training scheme for GPTRec:
   1) Supervised pre-training: Train GPTRec to mimic a teacher model (e.g. BERT4Rec) using standard next-item prediction. This achieves good accuracy.
   2) Reinforcement fine-tuning: Use proximal policy optimization to fine-tune GPTRec for any desired metric (e.g. diversity). This aligns it with complex beyond-accuracy goals.

- The key idea is to use the teacher model to provide "perfect" recommendations for pre-training. Then reinforcement learning is used to optimize the metric of interest, without needing perfect training data.

- For efficiency, training is decomposed into separate generator, optimizer and validator processes. This allows leveraging both CPU and GPU parallelism.

Contributions:
- Show that pre-trained GPTRec matches BERT4Rec accuracy using a generative next-item strategy instead of score-and-rank.
- Demonstrate how GPTRec can be fine-tuned for goals like diversity and popularity bias reduction. Outperforms heuristic re-ranking methods.  
- Propose a general methodology to align sequential models to any desired metric through reinforcement learning.

In summary, this paper enables optimization of generative sequential models like GPTRec for complex beyond-accuracy goals. It proposes an effective 2-stage training scheme and demonstrates improved accuracy-diversity trade-offs compared to prior methods.
