# [Pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0212)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is whether strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattice geometries, which have not been previously explored for this effect. The key hypotheses tested are:1) Strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields in columnar and staggered π-flux square lattices, similar to its known effect in honeycomb lattices. 2) Removing the π-flux and introducing staggered hopping parameters in the square lattice can produce Dirac cones, which could then exhibit pseudo-magnetic fields under strain.3) Transforming the staggered square lattice into a brick wall lattice makes it topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice, allowing strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields to emerge.The authors systematically test these hypotheses through analytical and numerical calculations on tight-binding models. Their main findings are that strain alone does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in the π-flux square lattices, but alternative methods like engineered potentials or hoppings can create this effect. However, strain does induce pseudo-magnetic fields and pseudo-Landau levels in the staggered zero-flux square lattice, which becomes topologically honeycomb-like when hoppings are made anisotropic.In summary, this paper explores whether strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, previously studied only in honeycomb lattices, can be extended to square lattice systems by modifying flux and hopping parameters. The analysis reveals both the constraints and opportunities for harnessing this phenomenon in square geometries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It investigates the effects of strain on square lattices with columnar and staggered π-flux patterns. The authors show that strain alone does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in these lattices, but instead only modulates the Fermi velocity.2. The paper proposes alternative methods to generate pseudo-magnetic fields in columnar and staggered π-flux square lattices, such as using non-uniform on-site potentials or anisotropic hoppings. Analytical predictions for resulting pseudo-Landau levels are provided. 3. For staggered zero-flux square lattices, the paper shows both uniaxial and triaxial strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields and dispersive pseudo-Landau levels. Breaking bonds to transform into a brick-wall lattice reveals topological equivalence with a honeycomb lattice.4. Overall, the results expand our understanding of strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields to new square lattice geometries beyond graphene. Both analytical effective models and numerical tight-binding simulations support the findings.In summary, the key contribution is elucidating the effects of strain on various square lattice configurations, proposing methods to induce pseudo-magnetic fields in these systems, and revealing connections to honeycomb lattices. The results generalize strain engineering tools to new Dirac materials systems.
