# [Pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0212)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is whether strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattice geometries, which have not been previously explored for this effect. 

The key hypotheses tested are:

1) Strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields in columnar and staggered π-flux square lattices, similar to its known effect in honeycomb lattices. 

2) Removing the π-flux and introducing staggered hopping parameters in the square lattice can produce Dirac cones, which could then exhibit pseudo-magnetic fields under strain.

3) Transforming the staggered square lattice into a brick wall lattice makes it topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice, allowing strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields to emerge.

The authors systematically test these hypotheses through analytical and numerical calculations on tight-binding models. Their main findings are that strain alone does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in the π-flux square lattices, but alternative methods like engineered potentials or hoppings can create this effect. However, strain does induce pseudo-magnetic fields and pseudo-Landau levels in the staggered zero-flux square lattice, which becomes topologically honeycomb-like when hoppings are made anisotropic.

In summary, this paper explores whether strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, previously studied only in honeycomb lattices, can be extended to square lattice systems by modifying flux and hopping parameters. The analysis reveals both the constraints and opportunities for harnessing this phenomenon in square geometries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It investigates the effects of strain on square lattices with columnar and staggered π-flux patterns. The authors show that strain alone does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in these lattices, but instead only modulates the Fermi velocity.

2. The paper proposes alternative methods to generate pseudo-magnetic fields in columnar and staggered π-flux square lattices, such as using non-uniform on-site potentials or anisotropic hoppings. Analytical predictions for resulting pseudo-Landau levels are provided. 

3. For staggered zero-flux square lattices, the paper shows both uniaxial and triaxial strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields and dispersive pseudo-Landau levels. Breaking bonds to transform into a brick-wall lattice reveals topological equivalence with a honeycomb lattice.

4. Overall, the results expand our understanding of strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields to new square lattice geometries beyond graphene. Both analytical effective models and numerical tight-binding simulations support the findings.

In summary, the key contribution is elucidating the effects of strain on various square lattice configurations, proposing methods to induce pseudo-magnetic fields in these systems, and revealing connections to honeycomb lattices. The results generalize strain engineering tools to new Dirac materials systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings in this paper:

This paper investigates the effects of strain on square lattices and finds that strain alone cannot induce pseudo-magnetic fields in the columnar or staggered pi-flux square lattices, but it can in the staggered zero-flux square lattice which is shown to be topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields:

- The focus on square lattice geometries is novel. Most prior work has studied pseudo-magnetic fields in honeycomb lattices like graphene. Looking at square lattices expands the materials systems where these effects could potentially be observed.

- The finding that strain alone does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in the π-flux square lattices is an important result. It shows that strain effects can be very geometry dependent, even in systems with Dirac cones. 

- Demonstrating alternative ways to generate pseudo-magnetic fields, through engineered potentials or anisotropic hopping, provides useful insights. This shows there are multiple "tuning knobs" available depending on the experimental system.

- Making the connection between the staggered zero-flux square lattice and the honeycomb lattice is clever. It provides a bridge between the new square lattice results and the established effects in graphene-like systems.

- Overall, this paper takes a very thorough look at strain effects in a class of systems that has been relatively unexplored. The theoretical analyses of the various lattices using both continuum and tight-binding models is quite comprehensive.

- In comparison to other work, this paper stands out for considering novel geometries and lattice configurations. The exhaustive analyses of different strain patterns provides new insights that build nicely upon prior understanding developed for honeycomb systems.

In summary, this work expands research on strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields into new lattice geometries and configurations. It reveals the importance of geometry in dictating strain effects, even in Dirac materials. The comprehensive analyses and connections made represent an incremental but meaningful advance for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring strain effects and possible induction of pseudo-magnetic fields in other lattice geometries beyond honeycomb, such as kagome, Lieb, and various Archimedean lattices. The authors show that pseudo-magnetic fields can also arise in certain square lattice geometries, so extending this to other lattices could reveal new physics.

- Experimental realization of the strained lattices studied theoretically in this work, especially the staggered zero-flux square lattice, using platforms like optical lattices or circuit QED. The authors suggest their strained lattices may be more experimentally feasible than the $\pi$-flux variants.

- Further numerical studies on larger systems to complement the analytical and tight-binding results presented. The authors use relatively small system sizes in their tight-binding calculations, so examining scaling on larger lattices could provide additional insights.

- Considering the effects of electron-electron interactions in the strained lattices, which may lead to correlated phenomena not captured at the single-particle level studied here. The role of interactions in pseudo-magnetic fields is relatively less explored.

- Investigating transport signatures of the pseudo-Landau levels and other strain-induced effects predicted in this work, which could guide future experiments. The authors mainly focus on spectral properties.

- Extending the strain-engineering approach to engineer other effective gauge fields, such as Rashba spin-orbit coupling, in the square lattice geometries.

In summary, the authors lay out a research direction of applying strain to unconventional lattices beyond graphene, suggest several experimentally relevant geometries, and propose future work to complement their theoretical analysis with numerical, experimental, and many-body studies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the effects of strain on two-dimensional square lattices and examines methods for inducing pseudo-magnetic fields. The authors find that strain alone does not generate pseudo-magnetic fields in columnar or staggered π-flux square lattices, but instead only modulates the Fermi velocity. However, pseudo-magnetic fields can be created through engineered non-uniform on-site potentials or anisotropic hoppings. For staggered zero-flux square lattices, strain is able to induce pseudo-magnetic fields and pseudo-Landau levels at the Dirac points. By eliminating a quarter of the bonds, the authors show that a staggered zero-flux square lattice becomes topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice, exhibiting pseudo-magnetic fields under strain. Overall, this work expands the effect of strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields beyond honeycomb lattices to square lattice geometries.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper investigates the effects of strain on two-dimensional square lattices with and without π-flux. In the columnar and staggered π-flux square lattices, the authors find that strain only modulates the Fermi velocity and does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields. However, pseudo-magnetic fields can be generated by introducing spatially non-uniform on-site potentials or anisotropic hoppings in these lattices. For the staggered zero-flux square lattice, the authors show that strain patterns commonly used in graphene, such as uniaxial and triaxial strains, are able to induce pseudo-magnetic fields and pseudo-Landau levels at the Dirac points. By breaking a quarter of the bonds in this lattice, it becomes topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice and continues to exhibit pseudo-magnetic fields under strain. Overall, this work expands the effect of strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields beyond honeycomb lattices to square geometries. It also proposes alternative methods to generate pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattices using engineered on-site potentials or hoppings when strain alone is insufficient.

In summary, this paper provides valuable insights into inducing pseudo-magnetic fields and manipulating Dirac fermions in square lattices. The authors demonstrate both similarities and differences compared to strained graphene. Their results enhance the understanding of strain effects in Dirac materials with square geometries. The proposed square lattice models with tunable pseudo-magnetic fields could potentially be realized in experiments using optical lattices or circuit arrays.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates the effects of strain on two-dimensional square lattices with and without π-flux. The main method is analytical analysis using low-energy effective Dirac Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding models. The authors examine columnar and staggered π-flux square lattices and find strain does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in these systems. They show that pseudo-magnetic fields can instead be generated through engineered non-uniform on-site potentials or anisotropic hoppings. Removing the flux, the authors find strain is able to induce pseudo-magnetic fields and pseudo-Landau levels in the resulting staggered zero-flux square lattice. They also reveal this strained staggered zero-flux lattice is topologically equivalent to a strained honeycomb lattice by breaking a quarter of the bonds. Overall, the analytical framework of low-energy effective Hamiltonians allows the authors to systematically study the effects of strain and engineered potentials/hoppings in inducing pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattice geometries.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

1. The paper investigates whether strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattices with Dirac cones, similar to the effect in graphene. 

2. It examines two configurations of π-flux square lattices - columnar and staggered. It finds that strain alone does not induce pseudo-magnetic fields in these lattices, but rather modulates the Fermi velocity.

3. However, it shows that pseudo-magnetic fields can be generated in these lattices through alternative means - non-uniform on-site potentials for columnar lattices, and anisotropic hoppings for staggered lattices. 

4. For staggered lattices without π-flux, strain is shown to induce pseudo-magnetic fields and pseudo-Landau levels at the Dirac points. 

5. By breaking bonds in the staggered zero-flux lattice, it establishes topological equivalence with a honeycomb lattice, inheriting the ability for strain to induce pseudo-magnetic fields.

In summary, the key question addressed is whether strain can induce pseudo-magnetic fields and Landau quantization in square lattice geometries possessing Dirac cones, similar to its effect in graphene. The paper provides a systematic investigation of this across different square lattice configurations.
