# [Does Circuit Analysis Interpretability Scale? Evidence from Multiple   Choice Capabilities in Chinchilla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09458)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can existing techniques for circuit analysis scale to interpret the reasoning behind multiple-choice question answering in large language models?

Specifically, the authors aim to test whether techniques like logit attribution, attention pattern visualization, and activation patching can be applied to understand the algorithmic reasoning used by large language models like Chinchilla to answer multiple-choice questions. 

The paper focuses on investigating the circuitry in Chinchilla's 70B parameter model that allows it to identify the correct answer letter (A, B, C or D) given the answer text. The authors' goal is to see if they can identify, categorize and understand the key components involved in this reasoning using established circuit analysis techniques, despite Chinchilla's much greater scale compared to models these techniques have previously been applied to.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that existing circuit analysis techniques can scale up to interpret reasoning in very large language models, using multiple-choice question answering in Chinchilla as a case study. The paper aims to test this hypothesis and understand the extent to which these techniques can provide insight into Chinchilla's internal mechanisms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a case study of using circuit analysis techniques to interpret a large language model. The main contributions are:

1. Demonstrating that existing circuit analysis techniques like logit attribution, attention pattern visualization, and activation patching can be applied to large models like the 70B parameter Chinchilla to identify components involved in multiple choice question answering.

2. Studying the "correct letter" attention heads in detail to understand their operation, including using SVD to identify low-dimensional subspaces capturing their queries, keys, and values. 

3. Providing evidence that the query/key subspaces of correct letter heads encode a combination of general features like "nth item in an enumeration" as well as more specific features based on the letter identities. 

4. Summarizing the operation of the correct letter heads in pseudocode, while noting limitations in how faithfully this captures their actual behavior.

5. Discussing the challenges encountered in scaling up circuit analysis techniques like precisely determining node semantics, and highlighting areas for future work like developing better tools for automating circuit analysis.

Overall, this paper demonstrates both the promise of circuit analysis for interpreting large models as well as current limitations and areas for improvement in techniques for precise mechanistic interpretability. The analysis of the multiple choice question answering circuit provides a valuable case study and data point as research in this emerging field continues.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a case study applying existing circuit analysis techniques like logit attribution and attention pattern visualization to a large 70B parameter language model, finding they scale well to identify and understand circuits for multiple choice question answering, but also that explaining the specific features used in these circuits proves challenging, with results suggesting they use a mix of generalizable and specialized representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on interpreting and analyzing neural network models:

- Scale of model analyzed: This paper focuses on analyzing a very large 70 billion parameter model, Chinchilla. Most prior interpretability work has focused on much smaller models, so this helps test the scalability of interpretability techniques.

- Focus on an algorithmic task: The paper studies multiple choice question answering, which involves algorithmic symbol manipulation rather than just factual knowledge. This makes it a good test case for circuit analysis. Other algorithmic tasks studied include arithmetic and grammatical reasoning. 

- Identifying relevant components: The paper uses existing techniques like attention pattern analysis and activation patching to identify "output nodes" critical for the task. This extends prior work on locating key circuit components.

- Analyzing node semantics: The analysis tries to decompose the "correct letter" heads into semantic subspaces representing high-level features like "nth item in list". This goes beyond just locating components to understanding their computation. However, the results here seem more preliminary/mixed.

- Limitations: The circuit analysis is limited to a narrow distribution of multiple choice questions rather than general text. The semantics work identifies approximate directions but struggles to fully capture heads' behavior. So there are still challenges in scaling interpretability.

Overall, this paper makes progress on model scale and connects to an existing interpretability literature focused on algorithmic reasoning. But there is still more work needed to handle broader distributions and capture semantics. The limitations highlight remaining challenges in scaling interpretability techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Automating circuit analysis more, as the manual process is very labor intensive. The authors suggest this could help maintain faithfulness and completeness.

- Investigating different approaches for causal interventions (e.g. additive noise instead of resampling) to identify relevant circuit nodes, and comparing the resulting circuits. 

- Developing better tools and methods for deeply understanding the semantics of the information flowing through identified circuits, beyond just the structure. The authors found this difficult even for a narrow distribution.

- Studying the behavior of nodes identified on broader text prediction tasks, to examine if they implement more general functions that naturally supersede the narrow behaviors studied.

- Further examining nodes that may implement multiple functions depending on context, due to attention head or neuron superposition.

- Validating and fleshing out the entire proposed circuit diagram, as the authors primarily focused on the final nodes.

- Investigating alternative validation techniques like checking if interventions match between model and proposed circuit.

- Developing better methods to handle backup behaviors or other complex node interactions that could distort the effects of interventions.

- Considering individual neurons or groups, not just whole MLP layers, as the basic units of analysis.

- Comparing circuits found via different intervention methods to understand the tradeoffs.

- Examining if different models learn the same circuits for tasks like the one studied.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a case study of using circuit analysis techniques to understand the internal mechanisms underlying multiple-choice question answering in Chinchilla, a large 70 billion parameter language model. The authors identify a set of "correct letter" attention heads and MLPs that are responsible for taking the correct answer text and outputting the corresponding letter. They find that existing techniques like logit attribution, attention visualization, and activation patching scale up and allow them to discover these key nodes. The authors then analyze the "correct letter" heads in more detail, approximating their key, query, and value spaces with low dimensional embeddings. These embeddings seem to capture semantic features like enumerating the label positions and encoding token identities, providing some insight into the algorithm being implemented. However, the explanations are partial, suggesting that the semantics are messy. Overall, the paper demonstrates applying interpretability techniques to very large models, but also highlights the limitations around fully explaining the learned representations and computations. More research is needed to develop better tools for mechanistic interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a case study of using circuit analysis techniques to interpret the 70B parameter Chinchilla language model. The authors focus on studying multiple-choice question answering in Chinchilla, aiming to identify the mechanisms by which Chinchilla determines the correct answer label given the answer text. Through a combination of logit attribution, attention pattern visualization, and activation patching, the authors identify a set of "correct letter" attention heads and MLPs that are responsible for increasing the logit of the correct answer letter. 

The authors then investigate the semantics of the "correct letter" heads using singular value decomposition to identify low-dimensional subspaces capturing the queries, keys, and values. Experiments mutating prompts suggest these subspaces encode a combination of general features like "n-th item in an enumeration" as well as more specific features based on the token identities. However, the identified subspaces only partially explain behavior on randomized labels, suggesting the semantics are messy. Overall, the case study demonstrates interpretability techniques can scale to large models, but also highlights the difficulty of precisely determining the features used by model components.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a case study of circuit analysis in the large 70B Chinchilla language model, with the goal of testing the scalability of existing circuit analysis techniques. The authors focus on analyzing the circuit underlying multiple-choice question answering in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. To identify relevant circuit components, they use a combination of logit attribution to find nodes with high direct effects on the logits, activation patching to validate total effects, and attention pattern visualization to categorize nodes based on their behavior. They identify a set of "correct letter" attention heads that are central to determining which multiple choice answer label is correct. To better understand these heads, they use singular value decomposition (SVD) to compress the heads' key, query, and value spaces into low-dimensional subspaces that capture most of the variance. By examining the behavior of these subspaces under various prompt mutations, they identify features the subspaces seem to encode, like "n-th item in an enumeration", though find the subspace explanation only partially explains behavior on a randomized label distribution. Overall, the paper demonstrates the applicability of existing techniques like logit attribution and attention analysis at scale, while also highlighting the difficulty of precisely determining semantics, even in targeted algorithmic circuits.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is focused on using "circuit analysis" to interpret the internal mechanisms of large language models, specifically the 70 billion parameter Chinchilla model. Circuit analysis involves identifying and analyzing the specific components and pathways within a model that are responsible for particular behaviors. 

- The authors aim to address two weaknesses in prior circuit analysis work: 1) prior work has focused on small models, whereas this paper analyzes Chinchilla, and 2) prior work identifies relevant components but does not deeply analyze the semantics of the information flowing through them.

- The specific behavior analyzed is multiple-choice question answering, using examples from the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. The authors focus on how the model determines which answer label (A, B, C, D) corresponds to the correct answer text.

- The existing techniques of logit attribution, attention pattern visualization, and activation patching are shown to effectively identify relevant "output nodes" (attention heads and MLPs) in the large Chinchilla model. 

- Analysis of the semantics of the "correct letter" heads suggests they utilize both general features like "nth item in an enumeration" as well as more specific features based on the label tokens. However, these explanations only partially explain behavior on more diverse distributions.

- Overall, the paper demonstrates the scalability of circuit analysis techniques to large models for algorithmic tasks, but shows interpretability becomes more difficult for broader distributions and that identified explanations may be incomplete. The semantics of model components is highlighted as an open challenge.
