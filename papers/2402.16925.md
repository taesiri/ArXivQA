# [Minimize Control Inputs for Strong Structural Controllability Using   Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of finding the minimum number of control inputs (nodes) required to make a complex network system with linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics strongly structurally controllable (SSC). SSC means the system remains controllable for any numerical parameter values, given only the network structure (which links exist, with no precise weights). This optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard. Prior methods have limitations in addressing SSC for the most general "zero/nonzero/arbitrary" structure or do not scale well.

Solution:
The key insight is to formulate the SSC problem as a graph coloring problem using a defined "color change rule". This allows modeling it as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying reinforcement learning with a directed graph neural network that incorporates the graph structure. Specifically:

1. Establish graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions for SSC based on derived node sets from repeated color changes.

2. Design an MDP where states are node colors, actions are adding control nodes, rewards depend on network controllability.  

3. Use a directed graph convolutional neural network architecture to represent states and choose optimal actions.

4. Validate on a real-world social network and Erdos-Renyi random graphs.

Key Contributions:

- Formulates the minimum inputs for SSC problem as a graph coloring optimization based on a defined color change rule 
- Models the graph coloring process as a MDP amenable to reinforcement learning
- Incorporates directed graph neural networks to represent state and choose actions
- Reveals how network topology affects controllability - low in-degree nodes rather than hubs enable control
- Shows superior performance over a degree-based heuristic baseline

The method provides a flexible way to optimize control inputs for broader classes of network dynamics while exploiting graph structure. Key findings relate controllability to network characteristics beyond hub nodes.
