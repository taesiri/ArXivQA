# [Connecting the Dots: Collaborative Fine-tuning for Black-Box   Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities and remarkable transfer ability. However, existing fine-tuning methods require access to the model parameters, which is challenging as model owners often only provide black-box access to safeguard ownership. Thus, it is crucial to explore efficient fine-tuning for black-box VLMs where one only has access to input prompts and output predictions.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes CraFT, a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning approach for black-box VLMs. CraFT has three key components:

1) A prompt generation module that learns global text prompts tailored to downstream tasks using derivative-free optimization, specifically CMA-ES. 

2) A prediction refinement module with a 3-layer MLP that refines the black-box model output predictions in residual style. This can be optimized via gradients.

3) A novel collaborative training algorithm to train the above two modules jointly despite their use of different optimizers. It introduces an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistency and leverages residual connections to enable alternating optimization.  

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new framework CraFT for fine-tuning black-box VLMs without access to parameters or gradients. Comprises prompt and prediction refinement modules plus collaborative training.

- Achieves significant gains over baselines on 15 datasets, demonstrating effectiveness. Outperforms 12.45% over zero-shot CLIP with 8k queries and 16 shots.

- Requires only 1/80th of the memory for deployment compared to white-box methods. Trains faster than white-box methods while retaining accuracy.

- Provides a more realistic and applicable black-box assumption than prior arts, making minimal assumptions about hidden model.

To summarize, this paper pioneers an efficient approach to fine-tune vision-language models in black-box settings, with high relevance given model owners are increasingly providing black-box access only. The proposed CraFT framework is shown to be parameter-efficient, fast to train, and effective across diverse domains while requiring minimal deployment memory.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This paper proposes a new framework called Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CraFT) for fine-tuning black-box vision-language models (VLMs). It allows efficient fine-tuning without access to the model's parameters.

2. CraFT introduces two key modules - a prompt generation module to learn text prompts and a prediction refinement module to enhance the output predictions of the black-box VLM. It also develops a collaborative training algorithm and prediction-consistent loss to train these modules jointly.

3. Experiments on 15 datasets for few-shot classification demonstrate CraFT's superiority over baselines. It achieves decent gains with only 8,000 queries. Compared to white-box methods, CraFT trains faster, uses only 1/80 of the memory, with only a small drop in accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient framework CraFT to fine-tune black-box VLMs, which comprises collaborative modules and training methods. Experiments verify its effectiveness and efficiency.
