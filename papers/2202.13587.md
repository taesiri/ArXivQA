# [Rethinking and Refining the Distinct Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13587)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper is focused on refining and improving the Distinct-n metric for evaluating diversity in text generation. The key research questions/hypotheses addressed in the paper are:

1. The original Distinct metric proposed by Li et al. (2016) has some biases and unfairly penalizes longer sequences. Specifically, as the length of generated text increases, the Distinct score tends to decrease even if diversity is held constant. 

2. The authors hypothesize that a better way to calculate Distinct is to scale the number of distinct tokens by the expectation of distinct tokens rather than just the total number of tokens. They formally derive an "Expectation-Adjusted Distinct" (EAD) formula based on this idea.

3. The authors hypothesize that their proposed EAD metric will correlate better with human judgments compared to the original Distinct when evaluating diversity of generated text. They test this hypothesis through crowdsourced evaluation.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that scaling Distinct by the expectation rather than the total number of tokens will remove biases and allow for fairer assessment of diversity across varying sequence lengths. The paper aims to demonstrate problems with the original Distinct metric and show that the proposed EAD variant better matches human judgments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It investigates the performance of the original Distinct metric and demonstrates that it has biases that tend to assign higher penalties to longer sequences, making it not sufficiently fair for evaluating text diversity. 

2. It proposes a new metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) that improves on the original Distinct metric by scaling the number of distinct tokens based on their expectations. This helps remove the biases that exist in the original Distinct metric.

3. It provides empirical evidence from experiments on two dialog datasets showing that the proposed EAD metric correlates better with human judgments in evaluating response diversity compared to the original Distinct metric.

4. It discusses the drawbacks of the EAD metric, such as its reliance on idealized assumptions, and suggests feasible applications for using it in practice. 

5. It highlights risks of using the original Distinct metric for evaluating response diversity and proposes an improved metric. Overall, it aims to refine the commonly used Distinct metric to enable more accurate evaluation of text diversity in dialog systems and other text generation tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of an improved metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) to overcome biases in the commonly used original Distinct metric for evaluating text diversity. The refined EAD metric better correlates with human judgments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an improved metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) to evaluate diversity in text generation by adjusting the scaling factor in the original Distinct metric, providing empirical and theoretical evidence that EAD correlates better with human judgments and removes biases that penalize longer texts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research on evaluating diversity metrics for text generation:

- The paper clearly identifies an issue with the commonly used distinct metric - that it unfairly penalizes longer sequences - which has been overlooked in many prior works that use distinct. The authors provide empirical evidence and mathematical derivations to demonstrate this bias. 

- To address this issue, the paper proposes an improved metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) that adjusts the scaling factor based on token expectations. The new metric is shown to correlate better with human judgments compared to distinct.

- The paper builds on psycholinguistic research showing issues with distinct for analyzing child language. It makes a connection between those prior findings and issues arising in using distinct for evaluating neural text generation systems. 

- Many prior works have proposed or analyzed other diversity metrics like Self-BLEU, entropy etc. But this paper focuses specifically on refining the distinct metric due to its widespread use. The analyses are thorough and the improved EAD metric seems promising.

- The scale of analysis on multiple datasets, with human eval and correlations, is quite extensive compared to some other analyses of diversity metrics. The theoretical derivations and discussions around desired properties of a good metric are also more rigorous.

Overall, this paper makes an important contribution by thoroughly analyzing and refining a commonly used metric. The improved metric EAD seems to address some clear limitations of distinct. The analyses are comprehensive and the results demonstrate the benefits of the new metric. This helps advance the measurement of an important aspect - diversity - for text generation systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Further investigating different scaling methods for the distinct metric beyond what they explored in this work. They propose that the expectation calculated under the uniform distribution assumption may not be optimal. 

- Evaluating the performance of the proposed EAD metric on other text generation tasks beyond dialogue, such as story generation, where diversity is also an important factor.

- Exploring adjustments to EAD to make it more suitable for specialized datasets like Twitter, where the authors found EAD scores decline for longer texts. 

- Combining EAD with other metrics like Self-BLEU to create a more comprehensive automatic evaluation of diversity.

- Developing better methods for human evaluation of diversity that can produce more absolute scores to serve as improved ground truth. The authors note limitations in their crowdsourcing process for diversity scoring.

- Further analysis of the relationship between distinct metrics and human perception of diversity. The authors propose some correlations but more work could be done here.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the EAD metric itself, combining it with other metrics, evaluating it on more tasks, and better understanding its relationship to human judgments of diversity through more rigorous human annotation studies. The authors lay out a research agenda for better automatic evaluation of text diversity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an improved metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) for evaluating diversity in text generation. It points out issues with the commonly used Distinct metric, which scales the number of distinct tokens by the total number of tokens. This penalizes longer sequences more. The authors derive a new formula for EAD that instead scales by the expected number of distinct tokens. Empirical results on dialogue datasets show EAD correlates better with human judgements of diversity compared to Distinct. Theoretical analysis is provided to show EAD effectively removes the length bias. Overall, the paper demonstrates important flaws in Distinct, and offers a refined metric EAD that gives a more fair assessment of diversity for generated text.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an improved version of the Distinct metric for evaluating the diversity of generated text. The original Distinct score calculates diversity as the number of distinct tokens divided by the total number of tokens. However, the authors find that this approach unfairly penalizes longer sequences. To address this, they propose Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD), where the number of distinct tokens is scaled based on their expectation rather than the total tokens. 

The authors derive the formula for calculating EAD based on estimating the expectation of distinct tokens appearing. Empirical results on dialogue datasets show EAD correlates better with human judgments compared to the original Distinct score. EAD highlights the differences in diversity between models more effectively and does not penalize longer responses. The authors discuss how EAD relies on an idealized assumption, and may need adjustment for some specialized datasets. Overall, the refined EAD metric provides a more fair and accurate assessment of text diversity than the widely used original Distinct score.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes an improved version of the Distinct metric for evaluating diversity in text generation. The original Distinct metric calculates diversity by dividing the number of unique tokens by the total number of tokens. However, the authors find that this approach unfairly penalizes longer sequences. To address this, they propose Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD), where the number of distinct tokens is scaled by the expected number of distinct tokens rather than the total tokens. Since calculating the exact expected number of distinct tokens is intractable, they estimate it by calculating the expectation under a uniform token distribution assumption. Specifically, EAD scales the number of distinct tokens by the vocabulary size multiplied by one minus the probability of a token not appearing raised to the power of the total tokens. Experiments show EAD correlates better with human judgments compared to original Distinct.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points from the paper are:

- It identifies an issue with the commonly used Distinct-n metric for evaluating diversity in text generation. Specifically, it shows that Distinct-n unfairly penalizes longer sequences.

- The Distinct-n metric calculates diversity by taking the number of distinct n-grams divided by the total number of n-grams. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that this leads to lower diversity scores for longer texts, even if they are sampled from the same distribution. 

- To address this issue, the authors propose a new metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD). EAD adjusts the scaling factor in Distinct-n based on the expected number of distinct tokens rather than just the total number of tokens. 

- Experiments demonstrate that EAD correlates better with human judgments of diversity compared to Distinct-n. It removes the length bias and provides a more fair assessment of different text generation models.

In summary, the key issue addressed is the unfair length bias in the widely used Distinct-n metric for text diversity. The authors propose an improved EAD metric to remove this bias.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes refinements to the widely used Distinct-n metric for evaluating diversity in text generation. The authors find issues with the original Distinct metric, showing it is biased against longer sequences and does not produce stable scores when sequence length varies. To address this, they propose a new metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) that normalizes distinct counts by their expectation rather than the total token count. They derive a formula for EAD based on the expectation of distinct tokens under a uniform token distribution. Empirical experiments on dialogue datasets demonstrate EAD correlates better with human judgments than original Distinct. The authors suggest using EAD when the training corpus exhibits stable diversity with length, otherwise checking for length biases first. Overall, this paper demonstrates issues with the original Distinct metric and proposes a refined EAD metric that better measures diversity independently of length.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the commonly used Distinct-n metric for evaluating diversity in text generation. The authors find that the original Distinct metric tends to unfairly penalize longer sequences and is not a stable measure of diversity when sequence length varies. They propose an improved metric called Expectation-Adjusted Distinct (EAD) that scales the number of distinct tokens by their expected value to account for sequence length.
