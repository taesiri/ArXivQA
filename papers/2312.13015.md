# [VIBES: Vibro-Inertial Bionic Enhancement System in a Prosthetic Socket](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13015)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Providing sensory feedback is critical for prosthetic users, but few devices fully integrate haptic feedback technology to transmit high-frequency contact cues like surface texture and initial contact.
- Existing solutions place vibrotactile actuators on the arm/wrist rather than integrating them into the prosthesis. This lacks embodiment and is inconvenient.
- There is a need for an intuitive, wearable haptic feedback system embedded in the prosthesis that conveys texture and contact information.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present VIBES - a vibrotactile feedback system embedded in a prosthetic hand socket to transmit high-frequency tactile cues related to texture and contact. 
- It uses two compact vibrotactile actuators in direct skin contact to provide localized somatotopic feedback. 
- Accelerometer signals from the prosthetic fingers are processed and encoded into actuator vibrations to provide modality-matched vibrotactile feedback.

Contributions:
- Physical + psychophysical characterization of the vibration actuators for conveying different tactile textures.
- Pilot testing with a prosthesis user for texture discrimination tasks with and without vibrotactile feedback.
- VIBES allows improved sandpaper grit discrimination over no feedback - 52% vs 40% accuracy.
- Provides intuitive, wearable haptic feedback for texture and contact cues embedded into the prosthesis.
- Complements prior SoftHand Pro force feedback solutions for adaptable multi-modal haptic feedback.

In summary, the paper presents VIBES, an integrated vibrotactile feedback system for prosthetic hands that shows promise in conveying texture and contact information to improve functionality. Key contributions include the system design, characterization, and pilot testing showing improved texture discrimination with a prosthesis user.
