# [See, Say, and Segment: Teaching LMMs to Overcome False Premises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for segmentation tasks can fail under false premise queries, where the query refers to something not present in the image. They tend to hallucinate a segmentation instead of rejecting the query.
- Current models also lose their ability to reliably determine if an object is present ("see") or interact naturally ("say") after fine-tuning, a form of catastrophic forgetting.
- There is a need for models that can "see" if objects are present, "say" something to the user if not, and "segment" objects appropriately when present.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new false premise correction dataset based on RefCOCO that contains both positive and false premise queries.
- Propose a cascaded model approach using separate "see/say" and segmentation models. 
- Develop SESAME, a joint trained LMM that can "see" using object detection, "say" by telling the user if objects don't exist and providing corrections/alternatives, and "segment" by outputting masks for existing objects.

Main Contributions:
- New false premise correction dataset for referential segmentation
- Cascaded model and joint training approach to avoid catastrophic forgetting
- SESAME model that achieves substantially higher accuracy in detecting false premises, providing helpful feedback, and segmenting objects compared to baselines
- Demonstrate SESAME can understand complex instructions and multi-round interactions
- Show the approach does not compromise performance on standard segmentation tasks

In summary, the paper addresses an important problem in training segmentation models robust to false premises, while retaining seeing, saying and segmentation capabilities. The results showcase significant improvements over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of this paper:

The paper introduces a new False Premise Correction benchmark dataset and a See-Say-Segment method that improves an LMM's ability to detect and respond to false-premise referring segmentation queries by seeing if objects are present, saying if they are not or correcting semantic errors, and segmenting objects if they exist, through model chaining and joint training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of a new dataset and task called False Premise Correction for evaluating an LMM's ability to "see" if an object is present in an image, "say" something about it if not, and "segment" the object if present. This includes the creation of the FP-RefCOCO (+/g) datasets.

2. Proposal of a cascading model approach and an integrated LMM called SESAME that is trained using a joint training strategy to enable it to "see", "say", and "segment". SESAME shows significant improvements over baseline methods in detecting false premises, providing helpful feedback, and segmentation quality.

3. Demonstration that SESAME can understand and respond to complex conditional instructions, engage in multi-round interactions, and leverage commonsense reasoning to suggest alternative relevant objects/concepts.

4. Quantitative analysis showing SESAME achieves relative gains of 55.45% in false premise detection, provides helpful feedback 67% of the time, and 31.65% higher segmentation IOU compared to baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of the False Premise Correction task and an LMM called SESAME that can robustly handle false premise queries through enhancements in its abilities to "see", "say", and "segment".


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- False premises - The paper focuses on handling false premise queries in referring image segmentation, where the query refers to an object that does not actually exist in the image.

- See, Say, Segment - The three core capabilities the paper aims to enable in language models: detecting nonexistent referents ("see"), providing helpful feedback to the user ("say"), and segmenting existing referents ("segment"). 

- Catastrophic forgetting - The problem that fine-tuning language models for new skills like segmentation causes them to lose or forget earlier capabilities like determining if a referent exists.

- Referring segmentation - The task of segmenting the pixels corresponding to objects referred to by natural language queries.

- Reasoning segmentation - A more complex form of referring segmentation requiring reasoning and world knowledge to understand complex queries. 

- Language models (LMMs) - Large pre-trained neural language models that are later fine-tuned for downstream tasks.

- False Premise Correction dataset - A new benchmark dataset introduced, based on RefCOCO, containing matched false premise and corrected referring expressions.

- Cascaded models - One approach using separate "see/say" and "segment" modules.  

- Joint training - Fine-tuning a single model on a blend of datasets to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

- SESAME model - The proposed See, Say, Segment model trained using joint training to handle false premises.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel dataset called FP-RefCOCO for false premise correction. What are the key limitations of existing datasets like R-RefCOCO that FP-RefCOCO aims to address? How does the process of generating negative samples in FP-RefCOCO lead to more contextually relevant false premises?

2. The paper introduces a new task called False Premise Correction. What are the 3 core capabilities - "See", "Say", and "Segment" - that models need to demonstrate competence on this task? Why is the "Say" capability especially important for real-world conversational AI systems?  

3. The paper finds that fine-tuning LMMs like LISA on segmentation tasks leads to catastrophic forgetting of innate skills like "See" and "Say". Why does this happen and how does the joint training approach used in SESAME counter this?

4. What is the unified training set used in SESAME and what is the significance of including the R-RefCOCO dataset alongside FP-RefCOCO? How does this impact the model's ability to suggest corrections versus outright rejections?

5. The paper introduces both a cascading model approach and an integrated model called SESAME. What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches? When would the cascading model be preferred over SESAME?  

6. The paper evaluates the models on detection accuracy, CLAIR score, and segmentation cIoU. Why are multiple evaluation metrics necessary to fully assess performance on False Premise Correction? What limitations exist in evaluating the "Say" capability?

7. How does SESAME compare against prior work on conventional referring segmentation benchmarks containing only positive samples? What does this indicate about the joint training approach?

8. What trends do you observe in the ablation study that varies the percentage of false premise queries at test time? How does false premise robustness impact downstream performance?  

9. The qualitative examples show SESAME's ability to handle conditional instructions and multi-round interactions. What extensions of the method could further improve such conversational reasoning abilities?  

10. The paper focuses on open-domain false premise correction in referring segmentation. How could the key ideas be extended to other domains like VQA or embodied AI? What new challenges might arise?
