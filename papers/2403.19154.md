# [STaR-GATE: Teaching Language Models to Ask Clarifying Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models often struggle to ask good follow-up questions when prompted by users, leading to ineffective responses due to task ambiguity. 
- Preference optimization methods like RLHF can reduce models' tendency to ask clarifying questions.
- Existing elicitation methods have limitations around flexibility, relevance of questions, or reliance on proprietary models.

Proposed Solution:  STaR-GATE 
- Iterative self-improvement algorithm combining active preference elicitation (GATE) with a self-supervised loop (STaR).  
- Simulates conversations between a Questioner model and a Roleplayer model with access to latent user preferences.
- Questions are rewarded based on increases in log probability of gold responses from an Oracle with full user preferences.
- Additional response regularization prevents the Questioner from only asking questions.

Contributions:
- Synthetic dataset of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts with gold responses.
- Define a log probability-based reward function and response regularization method.  
- Show questions from finetuned model increase probability of gold responses across iterations.
- Finetuned model achieves 72% win rate against initial model after two iterations.
- Demonstrate generalization beyond the Roleplayer model used during training.

In summary, the paper introduces an iterative self-improvement approach to teach language models to ask better preference elicitation questions. Evaluations on a new synthetic dataset demonstrate improved performance in generating personalized responses.
