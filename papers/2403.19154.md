# [STaR-GATE: Teaching Language Models to Ask Clarifying Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models often struggle to ask good follow-up questions when prompted by users, leading to ineffective responses due to task ambiguity. 
- Preference optimization methods like RLHF can reduce models' tendency to ask clarifying questions.
- Existing elicitation methods have limitations around flexibility, relevance of questions, or reliance on proprietary models.

Proposed Solution:  STaR-GATE 
- Iterative self-improvement algorithm combining active preference elicitation (GATE) with a self-supervised loop (STaR).  
- Simulates conversations between a Questioner model and a Roleplayer model with access to latent user preferences.
- Questions are rewarded based on increases in log probability of gold responses from an Oracle with full user preferences.
- Additional response regularization prevents the Questioner from only asking questions.

Contributions:
- Synthetic dataset of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts with gold responses.
- Define a log probability-based reward function and response regularization method.  
- Show questions from finetuned model increase probability of gold responses across iterations.
- Finetuned model achieves 72% win rate against initial model after two iterations.
- Demonstrate generalization beyond the Roleplayer model used during training.

In summary, the paper introduces an iterative self-improvement approach to teach language models to ask better preference elicitation questions. Evaluations on a new synthetic dataset demonstrate improved performance in generating personalized responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing STaR-GATE, an iterative algorithm that combines active preference elicitation (GATE) with a self-improvement loop inspired by STaR. Specifically:

1) The authors introduce STaR-GATE, a simple algorithm that iteratively improves a language model's ability to elicit user preferences by asking questions. 

2) They generate a synthetic dataset consisting of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts, each paired with a personalized gold response.

3) They show that finetuning with STaR-GATE enables a language model to generate questions that significantly increase the probability of generating gold responses. 

4) They demonstrate that adding response-regularization to STaR-GATE yields a fine-tuned model able to use the elicited preferences to generate better responses, with a high win rate against the initial model.

5) They show that the finetuned model generalizes beyond the roleplayer it was trained with.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting STaR-GATE as a method to iteratively teach a language model to ask better, more useful questions in order to elicit user preferences and provide better, more personalized responses.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new method called "STaR-GATE" that combines active preference elicitation (GATE) with a self-improvement loop inspired by Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). Could you elaborate more on why you chose to combine these two methods? What are the key advantages of this combination?

2. In the STaR-GATE algorithm, you alternate between different splits of tasks and personas during training to prevent overfitting. What motivated this design choice? Did you experiment with other strategies like simply using a held-out validation set?  

3. The log probability reward function is based on the initial pretrained model's probability of generating the gold response. What happens if you base it on the probability from the current policy instead? Does that lead to faster or slower learning?

4. You use expert iteration in the outer loop of training. Did you experiment with any on-policy or off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms? If so, how did they compare to expert iteration?

5. The response regularization term is important to prevent the model from only asking questions. Did you try any other techniques to address this issue, like directly supervising the quality of questions? 

6. You trained and evaluated with a 7B parameter Mistral model. How do you think the STaR-GATE approach would work with much larger models like PaLM or GPT-4? Would larger models learn to ask better questions faster or slower?

7. The gold responses are generated by GPT-4 which likely influences what the Mistral model learns to ask about. If you changed the model used to generate gold responses, how might that impact the types of questions learned?  

8. You use simulated conversations with a fixed roleplayer model during training. Did you experiment with varying the roleplayer model to improve robustness? Does the choice of roleplayer significantly impact success?

9. How does the sample efficiency of STaR-GATE compare to other offline or online dialog learning methods? Could sample efficiency be improved by using demonstrations or human feedback?

10. One limitation mentioned is the reliance on gold responses as labels. Do you think removing this dependency is possible by using the policy model itself to determine useful questions, perhaps by looking at influence on its own response quality?
