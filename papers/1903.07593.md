# [Learning Correspondence from the Cycle-Consistency of Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07593)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn visual correspondence from raw unlabeled video in a self-supervised manner. The key ideas and hypotheses are:- Visual correspondence is crucial for visual reasoning, but obtaining ground truth supervision is expensive and limited.- There is inherent correspondence between observations in raw video adjacent in time due to the continuity of the visual world. This can provide free supervision through temporal cycle consistency.- By tracking patches backwards and forwards in time in a learned feature space and optimizing for cycle consistency, a model can learn a feature representation useful for establishing correspondences. - The learned representation can support correspondence at various levels, from pixel-level optical flow to mid-level patch correspondence to high-level object tracking, without specific fine-tuning.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that cycle consistency in time is a powerful self-supervised signal that can be used to learn visual correspondence from scratch on raw video data. The key idea is that correspondence requires a feature space that is invariant to transformations; by optimizing cycle consistency the model is encouraged to develop such feature representations.
