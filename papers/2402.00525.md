# [StopThePop: Sorted Gaussian Splatting for View-Consistent Real-time   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an efficient method for differentiable rendering of 3D scenes as mixtures of Gaussians. However, it uses approximations like flattening the 3D Gaussians into 2D splats and simplified depth sorting that can cause popping artifacts during view changes.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that performs per-pixel sorting of splats to eliminate popping artifacts. 
- They introduce an accurate per-ray depth calculation that considers the point of highest Gaussian contribution along each view ray. This creates a view-consistent splat order.
- To make per-pixel sorting feasible, they exploit coherence between neighboring rays with hierarchical culling and resorting to minimize sorting overhead.
- Their method combines compute optimizations like tile-based culling, optimized per-tile depth, and load balancing to achieve real-time performance.

Main Contributions:
- A hierarchical 3DGS renderer that enables per-pixel sorting of splats removing popping artifacts during view changes.
- In-depth analysis and optimizations for feasible per-pixel depth approximation and sorting.  
- A compute-optimized pipeline with specialized stages and optimizations for efficient hierarchical resorting.
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation showing their method eliminates popping while having comparable quality and only 4% average slowdown compared to 3DGS.
- Enforcing consistency allows reducing Gaussians by 50% with nearly equal quality but almost 2x faster performance.

In summary, the paper tackles the view inconsistency issue in 3DGS rendering using a novel hierarchical resorting approach. With specialized optimizations, it eliminates popping artifacts while retaining real-time performance and quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel hierarchical rasterization approach for 3D Gaussian splatting that systematically resorts and culls splats to eliminate popping artifacts and view inconsistencies with minimal processing overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is a novel hierarchical rasterization approach for 3D Gaussian splatting that systematically resorts and culls splats to effectively eliminate popping artifacts and view inconsistencies. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A per-pixel depth computation method that considers the highest contribution along each view ray as the optimal blending depth. This eliminates popping artifacts but is very costly.

2) A hierarchical rendering pipeline with multiple culling and resorting stages across different levels (tiles, groups of rays, individual rays) to share sorting efforts and incrementally refine the sort order.

3) Optimizations like per-tile opacity culling, tile-depth adjustment, and load balancing to streamline computations.

4) Quantitative and qualitative evaluations showing the proposed method eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies with minimal overhead compared to original 3D Gaussian splatting.

In summary, the main contribution is a fast hierarchical rasterization approach that enables per-pixel sorting of gaussians to achieve view-consistent real-time rendering of 3D scenes.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel hierarchical rasterization approach for Gaussian splatting. Can you explain in detail how the hierarchical pipeline works and what are the key components (culling, depth approximation, sorting, etc.) at each level of the hierarchy? 

2. One of the main contributions is the per-pixel depth calculation to determine the optimal blending depth. Walk through the mathematical derivation of how this depth is computed. What approximations did the authors make and what is the intuition behind the final equation?

3. The authors propose a tile-based culling approach to reduce the number of Gaussians processed per pixel. Explain the algorithm for finding the maximum 2D Gaussian contribution inside a tile and how it is used for culling. What is the impact on performance?

4. Explain the differences between the sorting strategies analyzed in the paper (global sorting, full per-ray sorting, fixed window resorting, hierarchical sorting). What are the tradeoffs between rendering quality and performance for each one? 

5. The hierarchical rasterizer processes batches of Gaussians across multiple shared queues. Discuss the pushing methodology employed and how warp voting is used to coordinate sorting across the queues.

6. The paper analyzes the link between opacity decay during training and increased popping artifacts at test time. Provide some hypotheses explaining this effect and how the hierarchical renderer is able to mitigate it.  

7. A view consistency metric called FLIP is proposed to quantify popping artifacts, explain why this is more effective than a simple MSE metric between novel views.

8. The user study compares videos from the method against ground truth animations. Discuss the design, stimuli used and results. Do the quantitative metrics align with the study?

9. The hierarchical renderer comes at a small cost in terms of performance compared to global sorting. Analyze the detailed breakdown of timings. Which stages are accelerated and which add overhead?

10. The method convincingly tackles popping artifacts but still relies on splat approximations. Discuss limitations of the current approach and potential avenues for future work in accurate Gaussian volume rendering.
