# [DiffMOT: A Real-time Diffusion-based Multiple Object Tracker with   Non-linear Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims at continuously tracking objects in video sequences. However, most existing MOT methods focus on pedestrian-dominant scenarios where objects move with linear motion patterns. 
- They fail to effectively track objects in other scenarios like sports and dance where objects exhibit more complex non-linear motion with acceleration, deceleration and irregular direction changes. Existing non-linear motion predictors either have rigid network structures or heavy computation that are not suitable for real-world applications.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel MOT tracker called DiffMOT that can effectively track objects with non-linear motion patterns in real-time.
- The key component is a Decoupled Diffusion-based Motion Predictor (D2MP) that models the entire distribution of various motions using a diffusion probabilistic model. It treats motion prediction as a generative modeling task.
- D2MP has a forward process that maps clean motion to random noise distribution and a reversed process to predict future motion by sampling from this distribution conditioned on historical motion information.
- A light-weight neural network called HMINet is used to guide this conditional sampling by extracting features from previous motions.
- D2MP enables real-time tracking by optimizing the diffusion process using only 1 sampling step during inference inspired by recent work on decoupled diffusion models.  

Main Contributions:
- First MOT tracker to introduce diffusion models for tackling complex non-linear motions.
- A novel decoupled diffusion-based motion predictor (D2MP) that models the distribution of diverse motions and also conditions the predictions on individual historical motions.
- Optimization of the diffusion framework for real-time tracking speed through decoupled training and single-step conditional sampling.
- State-of-the-art results on DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets, outperforming previous methods in tracking non-linear motions while running at 22.7 FPS.

In summary, the paper proposes a way to effectively track non-linear motions in real-time using conditional diffusion models. The optimized diffusion framework and conditional generation of futures motions are the main novelties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes DiffMOT, a real-time multiple object tracker for non-linear motion that introduces a decoupled diffusion-based motion predictor into the tracking-by-detection paradigm to model the motion distribution and generate future positions conditioned on historical trajectories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. They propose a novel multiple object tracker named DiffMOT with strong non-linear motion prediction and real-time speed. To the best of their knowledge, they are the first to introduce a diffusion model into MOT.

2. They introduce a decoupled diffusion-based motion predictor (D^2MP) to model the motion distribution of objects with non-linear movements. Compared to previous motion models, D^2MP excels in fitting non-linear motion and fast inference speed. 

3. DiffMOT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on major public datasets with non-linear motions. It achieves 76.2% and 63.4% HOTA metrics on SportsMOT and DanceTrack datasets respectively, outperforming previous SOTA by 2.1% in HOTA.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a diffusion-based MOT tracker called DiffMOT, which can handle non-linear object motion with real-time speed and state-of-the-art accuracy. The key ideas are introducing diffusion models into MOT and designing an efficient decoupled diffusion-based motion predictor.
