## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "LAVE: LLM-Powered Agent Assistance and Language Augmentation for Video Editing":

Problem:
Video editing often poses barriers for beginners due to the complexity of tools and the expertise required in creative aspects like ideation and storytelling. Most tools rely heavily on manual editing operations using complex user interfaces. This paper explores how to design a video editing tool that acts as a collaborator, constantly assisting users throughout the editing process.

Proposed Solution:
The authors present LAVE, a novel video editing tool that provides large language model (LLM) powered agent assistance and language-augmented features. Key capabilities:

- Video Editing Agent: Answers free-form language questions and assists users by planning and executing relevant editing actions like idea generation, footage overview, video retrieval, storyboarding, and clip trimming.  

- Language Augmentation: Automatically generates textual descriptions (titles, summaries) of video content to enable the agent and users to leverage the linguistic capabilities of LLMs.

- Flexible Editing: Supports both agent-assisted and direct manual editing for flexibility. Users can opt in/out of agent suggestions.

Contributions:

- Concept and implementation of the LAVE system for agent-assisted, language-augmented video editing

- Computational pipeline enabling video agent to interpret requests, plan editing actions, and execute them 

- User study evaluating system effectiveness and gathering insights on user perceptions of the agent-assisted paradigm

- Proposed design implications: Leverage language for interaction/content representation; provide adaptive agent support catering to user & task variability; consider users' prior LLM experience.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of collaborative human-AI experiences for lowering barriers in creative tools like video editing.
