# [ShareCMP: Polarization-Aware RGB-P Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03430)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ShareCMP, a shared dual-branch architecture for RGB-P multimodal semantic segmentation that aims to reduce model parameters while maintaining or improving performance. The authors construct a new underwater RGB-P dataset called UPLight with 12 semantic classes to provide data for autonomous underwater vehicle perception tasks. They design a Polarization Generate Attention (PGA) module to generate polarization images with rich features. A Class Polarization-Aware Loss (CPALoss) is also introduced to help the model better understand polarization properties of different classes and optimize the PGA module. Experiments on UPLight and two other RGB-P datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from ShareCMP while requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to previous methods. The shared encoder architecture with modal-exclusive components reduces parameters by about 30% compared to standard dual-branch models. Both the new polarization image representation and custom loss lead to notable gains over baseline approaches. By effectively exploiting RGB-P data for underwater scenes, this compact architecture sets a new state of the art while lowering resource requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes ShareCMP, a shared dual-branch RGB-P semantic segmentation framework with a Polarization Generate Attention module and Class Polarization-Aware Loss, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-P datasets while reducing model parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. The authors construct a new benchmark called UPLight for underwater RGB-P semantic segmentation, which provides data support for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to perform special perception tasks. 

2. They present a ShareCMP architecture with a shared dual-branch design to reduce the number of parameters of the multimodal semantic segmentation model.

3. They propose the Polarization Generate Attention (PGA) module to generate polarization modal images with richer polarization properties. 

4. They propose the Class Polarization-Aware Loss (CPALoss) along with a Class Polarization-Aware Auxiliary Head (CPAAHead) to improve the encoder's capability of perceiving the optical polarization properties of different classes.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed ShareCMP framework for efficient RGB-P semantic segmentation, including the UPLight dataset, the model architecture, the PGA module and the CPALoss. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RGB-P datasets with fewer parameters.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Multimodal semantic segmentation has been explored for modalities like RGB-D and RGB-T, but RGB-Polarization remains relatively unexplored.  
- Current RGB-P methods use fixed representations like Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and Angle of Linear Polarization (AoLP) which have limitations in representing polarization properties.  
- Dual-branch models like CMX and CMNeXt have good performance but a large number of parameters.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose ShareCMP, a shared dual-branch network, which reduces parameters by ~30% compared to dual-branch models.
- Construct UPLight, an underwater RGB-P dataset with 12 classes to promote RGB-P research for AUV perception.  
- Design Polarization Generate Attention (PGA) module to generate polarization images with richer properties compared to fixed AoLP/DoLP representations.
- Introduce Class Polarization-Aware Loss (CPALoss) to improve encoder's learning of polarization properties of different classes.

Main Contributions:
- ShareCMP architecture with shared encoder to reduce parameters.
- UPLight underwater RGB-P dataset with 12 classes. 
- PGA module to generate better polarization representations.
- CPALoss to improve understanding of polarization properties.
- ShareCMP achieves SOTA results on 3 RGB-P datasets with fewer parameters than state-of-the-art methods.
