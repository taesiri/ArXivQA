# [ShareCMP: Polarization-Aware RGB-P Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03430)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ShareCMP, a shared dual-branch architecture for RGB-P multimodal semantic segmentation that aims to reduce model parameters while maintaining or improving performance. The authors construct a new underwater RGB-P dataset called UPLight with 12 semantic classes to provide data for autonomous underwater vehicle perception tasks. They design a Polarization Generate Attention (PGA) module to generate polarization images with rich features. A Class Polarization-Aware Loss (CPALoss) is also introduced to help the model better understand polarization properties of different classes and optimize the PGA module. Experiments on UPLight and two other RGB-P datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from ShareCMP while requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to previous methods. The shared encoder architecture with modal-exclusive components reduces parameters by about 30% compared to standard dual-branch models. Both the new polarization image representation and custom loss lead to notable gains over baseline approaches. By effectively exploiting RGB-P data for underwater scenes, this compact architecture sets a new state of the art while lowering resource requirements.
