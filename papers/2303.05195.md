# [Revisiting Rotation Averaging: Uncertainties and Robust Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05195)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we improve the accuracy of global Structure-from-Motion pipelines by leveraging uncertainties in two-view epipolar geometries and investigating robust loss functions for rotation averaging? 

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Propagating uncertainties from two-view epipolar geometry estimations directly into the rotation averaging optimization. This allows weighting the relative rotation measurements based on their estimated quality/uncertainty.

- Exploring the use of the MAGSAC loss for rotation averaging instead of standard robust losses like L1. MAGSAC marginalizes over the inlier noise level, avoiding manually set thresholds.

- Evaluating these ideas extensively on standard datasets like 1DSfM and ETH3D. The combination of uncertainty propagation and MAGSAC loss gives superior performance over baselines.

- Showing the proposed method helps close the accuracy gap between incremental and global SfM approaches, while retaining efficiency advantages.

In summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that modeling uncertainty and using a better loss function will improve global SfM accuracy. The experiments seem to validate this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes to leverage the uncertainties in estimated two-view epipolar geometries to improve the rotation averaging step in global Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines. Specifically, it propagates the covariance matrices of the uncertainties to weight the edges in the rotation averaging optimization. This allows treating relative rotations of different quality accordingly. 

2. It explores using the MAGSAC loss function instead of commonly used robust losses like Soft L1 in rotation averaging. MAGSAC is designed to be more robust to outliers by marginalizing over the inlier noise scale.

3. The experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed techniques lead to more accurate global SfM reconstructions. The method outperforms baselines by a large margin and helps close the gap between incremental and global SfM approaches.

In summary, the key ideas are to utilize uncertainties from two-view estimations as weighting terms in rotation averaging, and using the MAGSAC robust loss. This improves global SfM accuracy and makes it more robust. The uncertainty propagation and choice of loss function seem to be the main novelties proposed.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes improving the accuracy of global Structure-from-Motion reconstruction pipelines by propagating uncertainties from two-view epipolar geometries into the rotation averaging step and using a robust MAGSAC loss function instead of standard losses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key ways it compares to other research on rotation averaging for global structure from motion:

- It focuses on better modeling the uncertainties in the relative rotation estimates used as input to the rotation averaging problem. Other works have not directly incorporated these uncertainties.

- It proposes directly using the covariance matrices for the relative rotations to weight the residuals in the rotation averaging optimization. Most works use equal weights or heuristic weighting schemes. 

- It explores using the MAGSAC loss for robustness against outliers in the relative rotations. Other works use standard robust losses like L1, Huber, etc. The MAGSAC loss is more principled for handling uncertainty.

- The experiments show superior accuracy over baseline methods on standard datasets like 1DSfM and ETH3D. This helps demonstrate the benefits of the proposed techniques.

- It bridges the accuracy gap between global and incremental SfM methods. Global methods are usually fast but less accurate. This work improves global method accuracy.

- The techniques are fairly general and could likely be integrated into other global SfM pipelines beyond the Theia framework used here.

Overall, the key novelties seem to be in direct uncertainty modeling via covariances and using the MAGSAC loss. The experiments demonstrate these provide noticeable gains in reconstruction accuracy over baseline global SfM techniques. This helps advance the state-of-the-art in global SfM.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Testing the proposed method on more diverse and challenging datasets to further validate its benefits. The paper showed results on 1DSfM and ETH3D datasets, but testing on more complex outdoor scenes with severe illumination changes, repetitive structures, dynamic objects, etc could reveal limitations.

- Exploring alternatives to estimating and propagating uncertainty from two-view geometries. The authors use covariance matrices from inlier point correspondences, but other ways to quantify uncertainty may work as well or better.

- Applying the uncertainty modeling and MAGSAC loss to other steps of the global SfM pipeline besides rotation averaging. For example, using them during translation averaging or triangulation could further improve the results. 

- Combining the proposed improvements with other advances for the optimization problem itself, such as the Shonan averaging method. The authors suggest their ideas could complement those works.

- Developing better automatic ways to set the parameters of the MAGSAC loss, as it currently needs some manual tuning. Learning these could make the whole pipeline more robust.

- Extending the global SfM approach to use more than two views where available and propagating uncertainties across multiple views. This could lead to even more reliable uncertainty estimates.

- Exploring different outlier rejection schemes before rotation averaging, as the current RANSAC may still let some outliers influence the optimization.

In summary, the main directions are: testing on more complex data, exploring alternatives for uncertainty estimation, applying the ideas to other parts of global SfM, combining with other optimization advances, automating parameter tuning, using more views, and improving outlier rejection.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes improvements to the rotation averaging step in global Structure from Motion pipelines. The main contribution is incorporating uncertainty information from the estimated pairwise relative poses into the rotation averaging optimization. This is done by propagating the covariance matrices of the epipolar geometry estimations and using them to weight the terms in the optimization cost function. The uncertainties provide a measure of the quality of each pairwise rotation constraint. The paper also explores using a variant of the MAGSAC loss function instead of standard robust losses like Soft L1. Experiments on large benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed modifications, especially combining uncertainty weighting and the MAGSAC loss, lead to significantly more accurate rotation averaging and overall 3D reconstructions compared to baseline methods. The results help close the accuracy gap between global and incremental SfM approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes improvements to the rotation averaging step used in global Structure from Motion pipelines for 3D reconstruction from images. The authors argue that current rotation averaging methods minimize a cost function that is only weakly connected to the input data, specifically the estimated pairwise epipolar geometries between images. They propose directly propagating the uncertainty from the pairwise geometry estimations into the rotation averaging problem. These uncertainties are obtained essentially for free from the Jacobians when refining the two-view geometries. This allows the rotation averaging to account for noise and quality differences in the relative rotation estimates. 

As a second contribution, the authors explore using a variant of the MAGSAC robust loss function instead of standard losses like Soft L1 during optimization. MAGSAC was originally proposed for robust fitting of epipolar geometries. The authors show it is also beneficial for rotation averaging, where setting a threshold for deciding on inlier vs outlier relative rotations is difficult. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that both proposed improvements lead to more accurate global SfM reconstructions compared to baselines. The gap between incremental and global SfM methods is reduced.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes an improved rotation averaging approach for global Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstruction. The key idea is to incorporate uncertainties from the estimated relative camera poses into the rotation averaging optimization. Specifically, the covariance matrices capturing uncertainty in the relative rotations are computed via uncertainty propagation from the feature matches. These covariance matrices are used to weight the terms in the rotation averaging cost function, so that less certain relative rotations contribute less. In addition, the paper explores using a MAGSAC-based robust loss function in place of standard losses like Soft L1. Experiments on the 1DSfM and ETH3D datasets show that the proposed uncertainty-aware rotation averaging with a MAGSAC loss leads to significantly more accurate global SfM reconstructions compared to prior methods. The improved accuracy is especially noticeable for lower quality image sets. Overall, the paper demonstrates that properly modeling noise and incorporating uncertainty measures can help close the performance gap between global and incremental SfM algorithms.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of improving the accuracy of global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction pipelines by revisiting the rotation averaging step. Specifically, it focuses on two aspects:

1. Incorporating uncertainties from two-view geometry estimation into the rotation averaging optimization. 

2. Exploring different robust loss functions for rotation averaging, with a focus on the MAGSAC loss.

The motivation is that current global SfM pipelines have lower accuracy compared to incremental SfM methods, and the authors hypothesize this is partly due to weaknesses in the rotation averaging step. By improving rotation averaging through these two proposed techniques, they aim to close the accuracy gap between global and incremental SfM.

The key ideas are:

- Propagate uncertainties from two-view geometry estimation as weights in the rotation averaging optimization. This accounts for varying reliability of relative pose estimates.

- Use the MAGSAC loss which is designed to be robust to outliers without needing to explicitly threshold residuals. Compare against other common robust losses.

- Integrate these ideas into an existing SfM pipeline (Theia) and evaluate on standard datasets.

In summary, the paper aims to improve global SfM accuracy by rethinking the rotation averaging step to better handle noise and outliers in relative pose estimates. This is done through a principled uncertainty propagation scheme and exploration of robust loss functions.
