## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Knowledge tracing (KT) models have become pivotal in educational technology for tracking students' knowledge states and providing personalized learning recommendations. However, some advanced models like deep learning-based KT, while more accurate, suffer from interpretability issues. The lack of model transparency poses challenges for stakeholders to comprehend and trust the system's decisions. Hence, enhancing model interpretability is critical.  

Proposed Solution: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of research on explainable knowledge tracing (xKT). It offers an novel taxonomy, categorizing KT models as "transparent" or "black box" based on their inherent interpretability. Transparent models like Bayesian KT are self-explanatory, while black boxes require additional techniques. The paper reviews interpretability methods for both models across three stages - ante-hoc (building transparency into models), post-hoc (explaining black boxes after training), and other dimensions exploiting unique KT data features. Practical applications in diagnostic reports, personalized recommendations etc. are discussed. Evaluation metrics centered on educational stakeholders are also analyzed.

Main Contributions:
1) First survey providing an in-depth analysis of xKT research - concepts, techniques, applications and evaluations
2) Novel taxonomy of KT models based on explainability 
3) Review of interpretability methods for transparent and black box models across different stages
4) Analysis of xKT applications in personalized education 
5) Exploration of evaluation metrics tailored to educational stakeholders

Overall, this comprehensive survey establishes a solid foundation for understanding xKT, aiming to inspire further research interest in this rapidly evolving area critical for building trust and transparency in AI-driven education.
