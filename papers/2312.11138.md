# [Rapid Open-World Adaptation by Adaptation Principles Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11138)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents can fail catastrophically when there are even minor variations to environments they are trained on. In contrast, humans can efficiently adapt to novel, unexpected situations.
- Current DRL methods lack three key capabilities that humans have: 1) Only adjust actions when necessary rather than re-learn entire tasks 2) Generalize adjustment learned in one situation to other similar situations 3) Quickly adapt within a small number of environment interactions

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose NAPPING (Novelty Adaptation Principles Learning), a method that works with pre-trained DRL agents to enable rapid adaptation when novelties/changes are introduced to environments. 
- NAPPING identifies regions in the embedded state space of a DRL agent where the policy no longer works well after a novelty occurs. It then learns an "adaptation principle" for each region, which is a new policy to replace the original policy in that region.
- Adaptation principles generalize to conceptually similar states based on the assumption that a DRL agent's embedded space maps semantically similar states together. 
- NAPPING adaptively creates Voronoi diagram partitions in the embedding space to delineate adaptation principle regions. It searches for the best action in each region using an evaluation function, learning and closing adaptation principles incrementally.

Main Contributions:
- A new method, NAPPING, that enables pre-trained DRL agents to rapidly adapt policies when novelties/changes occur in environments
- Demonstrated NAPPING enables adaptation in a few environment interactions across four distinct domains - CartPole, MountainCar, CrossRoad, and AngryBirds
- Showed NAPPING policies outperform standard approaches like online learning and fine-tuning as well as state-of-the-art open world learning methods
- Introduced concept of adaptation principles that adjust policies only where necessary and can generalize to similar situations
