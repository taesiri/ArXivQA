# [CAT-LLM: Prompting Large Language Models with Text Style Definition for   Chinese Article-style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05707)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text style transfer research focuses on English sentences, with limited work on long Chinese texts despite their linguistic complexity. 
- Traditional models struggle with lack of parallel data, low transfer accuracy, and difficulty evaluating unsupervised approaches.  
- Large language models (LLMs) have potential for complex style transfer but face challenges in comprehending abstract style relationships and reasoning in long texts.

Proposed Solution:
- A Chinese Article-style Transfer framework (CAT-LLM) utilizing LLMs for long Chinese text style transfer.
- A Text Style Definition (TSD) module that analyzes style features at the words and sentences levels using small ML models. Provides interpretable style definitions to guide LLMs.
- Style-enhanced prompts incorporating TSD output to help LLMs grasp target style without compromising original text integrity.
- Creation of 5 parallel Chinese article-style transfer datasets using ChatGPT to enable more accurate model evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- First application of LLMs for Chinese article-style transfer with a bespoke TSD module for style feature analysis.
- TSD module supports expandable style trees and integration with various LLMs for flexible optimization. 
- New parallel datasets and evaluation paradigm for long Chinese text style transfer research.
- Experiments show CAT-LLM balances accuracy and content preservation better than existing approaches across datasets and LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel LLM-based framework to address challenges in long Chinese text style transfer, with an interpretable style definition module, specialized prompts, and new parallel datasets that advance the state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Chinese Article-style Transfer framework (CAT-LLM) that leverages large language models and a tailored Text Style Definition module to efficiently transfer the style of Chinese articles while retaining original content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing CAT-LLM, a pioneering Chinese Article-style Transfer framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for the first time in Chinese article-style transfer. Extensive experiments show that CAT-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models in style transfer accuracy and content preservation. 

2. Engineering a Text Style Definition (TSD) module that integrates various small models to comprehensively summarize text styles at the words and sentences levels. This module enhances the LLMs' style transfer precision, supports dynamic expansion of internal style trees, and provides interpretability.

3. Creating five parallel datasets of Chinese article-style transfer using ChatGPT to assess the modelsâ€™ performance more accurately. This offers a novel evaluation paradigm for subsequent research.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the CAT-LLM framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs and a custom TSD module to efficiently transfer styles between Chinese articles while retaining the original content. The creation of parallel datasets also enables more accurate evaluation.

The paper proposes a Chinese Article-style Transfer framework (CAT-LLM) that utilizes large language models for long-text style transfer in Chinese. A key component is the Text Style Definition (TSD) module that analyzes style at the words and sentences levels to guide the LLMs. Style-enhanced prompts are constructed from the TSD to direct the LLMs. Parallel datasets are created to evaluate transfer accuracy and content preservation. The framework outperforms existing methods by balancing these two metrics. The analysis covers various textual features like part-of-speech, word length, emotion, sentences structure and rhetoric. The promp engineering and zero-shot learning with the LLMs are also important aspects explored.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a Text Style Definition (TSD) module to analyze text style. What are the key components and algorithms used in this module to analyze style at the words level and sentences level? How do they work together to generate a comprehensive style definition?

2. The style-enhanced prompt consists of 4 main parts - original text, task description, style definition, and output indication. What is the purpose of each part and how do they guide the LLMs to generate text with the target style? 

3. The paper creates 5 parallel datasets using ChatGPT for model evaluation. What are the key benefits of using parallel datasets compared to non-parallel datasets? How does this provide a new evaluation paradigm?

4. The paper evaluates both style transfer accuracy and content preservation. Why is balancing these two aspects important for a high-quality style transfer model? How does the proposed method achieve this balance?

5. What is the difference in how the proposed method leverages LLMs compared to prior works involving directly reading articles or role-playing with LLMs? How does the TSD module and prompt design enhance LLMs capabilities?  

6. The ablation study shows words level prompts have a bigger impact than sentences level prompts. Why might this be the case? How does prompt order also affect performance?

7. The method outperforms Style Transformer and RACoLN. What are the key limitations of these models that the proposed approach addresses?  

8. What role does the diversity of datasets play in evaluating model robustness and applicability? How do the chosen datasets showcase this?

9. The method focuses specifically on Chinese article-style transfer. What are some of the unique linguistic challenges for Chinese long texts? 

10. The conclusion mentions future plans for supervised fine-tuning based on the summarized datasets and style data. What are the potential benefits of this compared to directly using prompts?
