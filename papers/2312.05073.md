# [A Distributed ADMM-based Deep Learning Approach for Thermal Control in   Multi-Zone Buildings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05073)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a distributed control algorithm that leverages alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and deep learning models to dynamically adjust temperature setpoints in a multi-zone building for demand response events. The approach decomposes the global optimization problem of limiting the total building power consumption into subproblems solved independently by local controllers (LCs) for each zone. The LCs use recurrent state space models or state space models to accurately forecast the power consumption resulting from different setpoint changes. A coordinator handles the coupling constraint on total power usage by setting power targets for each zone. Experiments in an 18-zone simulated building show the algorithm successfully reduces power consumption below a limit during demand response events through planning the setpoint adjustments, while maintaining occupant comfort. The method is fully data-driven, not requiring any architectural knowledge or HVAC details of the building. Key benefits are scalability for large buildings, flexibility across building types, and integration of state-of-the-art deep learning for control. Convergence analysis proves this is the first application of a non-convex ADMM algorithm with deep learning models for distributed building control.
