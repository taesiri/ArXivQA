## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 This LaTeX code declares options for specifying journal metadata when typesetting a paper for submission. It allows the author to specify the journal name, abbreviation, full name, DOI abbreviation, and ISSN by passing the journal ID as an option.

For example, by specifying `\documentclass[FrontiersinVLSI]{article}` at the start of the document, it would set the metadata for the "Frontiers in VLSI" journal. This includes setting:

- `\@journal` to "frontiersinvlsi"
- `\@journalshort` to "Frontiers in VLSI" 
- `\@journalfull` to "Frontiers in VLSI"
- `\@doiabbr` to "frontiersinvlsi"
- `\@ISSN` to the ISSN number for that journal

It covers a wide range of MDPI and Frontiers journals across many fields like computer science, engineering, medicine, chemistry, etc.

The code allows customizing the manuscript submission for many different target journals by just changing a single option. It avoids having to manually set all the metadata each time.

Overall, it is a convenience code to standardize and simplify setting journal metadata when preparing LaTeX submissions. The summary focuses on the key purpose, functionality, and benefits of automating this journal metadata configuration.
