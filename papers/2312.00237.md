# [Negotiated Representations to Prevent Forgetting in Machine Learning   Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, which is when a model forgets previously learned information or tasks upon learning new data. This significantly limits neural networks' capabilities for continual or lifelong learning.

- Specifically, the paper tackles catastrophic forgetting in the context of class-incremental learning. This is a challenging scenario where the model must learn a sequence of classification tasks with new classes incrementally over time, without access to data from the previous tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method to prevent catastrophic forgetting by incorporating "negotiated representations" into the learning process. 

- The key ideas are: (1) Using divergence-based vector representations to maintain class separability and facilitate transfer learning. (2) Introducing a negotiation mechanism during training that restricts the model from completely changing its representations when learning something new. This allows balancing stability and plasticity.

- The negotiations constrain the model to stay in the vicinity of what it has learned before, preventing drastic changes to existing knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of negotiated representations for continual learning across various benchmark datasets - Split MNIST, Split Fashion MNIST, Split CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.

- Achieves substantially higher classification accuracy compared to baseline models without the proposed negotiation training paradigm.

- Proposes a principled way to allocate model capacity across tasks and ensure previous tasks do not get forgotten.

- Provides insights into hyperparameter selection - specifically the impact of negotiation rate and negotiation plasticity rate on model performance.

- Overall, makes a case for incorporating ideas from philosophical concepts to improve deep learning, opening interesting research directions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel training strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning scenarios, with very promising results on multiple benchmark datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel negotiated training paradigm to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by restricting model movement when learning new tasks, thus balancing plasticity to acquire new knowledge and stability to retain past knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios, specifically for class incremental learning. The key ideas proposed are:

1) Incorporating a "negotiation" mechanism during training where the model negotiates with the provided labels instead of directly optimizing predictions to match the labels. This is done to restrict the model from completely changing its internal representations when learning new tasks, preventing catastrophic forgetting.

2) Using divergence-based vector representations for classes instead of one-hot encodings. The vector representations are designed to maintain constant Hamming distance between class pairs to facilitate better separability. 

3) Gradual allocation of the model's capacity when training on new tasks using an optimal "negotiation plasticity" formula. This allows equal capacity allocation across tasks.

4) Demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed negotiated training approach on multiple benchmark datasets - Split MNIST, Split Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The method shows improved average accuracy compared to baseline models without negotiation, indicating its effectiveness.

In summary, the core contribution is a novel negotiated training procedure to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class incremental learning scenarios, with empirical validation on standard benchmark datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper argues that conventional one-hot encoding schemes used in neural networks can contribute to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios. Can you elaborate on the limitations of one-hot encoding that lead to this issue? What is the theoretical basis behind using divergence-based feature extraction as an alternative?

2) The negotiation training paradigm is a key contribution of this work. Can you explain the intuition behind how restricting model movement through negotiation helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting? What determines the optimal negotiation rate and how is it adjusted across tasks? 

3) The paper employs a minimum distance classifier for categorizing samples based on their vector representations. What are the advantages of using such a classifier in this continual learning context compared to other commonly used classifiers?

4) How exactly does the process of assigning vector representations to new classes work when they are introduced? Walk through the steps involved in predicting outputs, determining closest vectors, updating assignment matrix etc.

5) The paper argues that convolutional neural networks are well-suited for the proposed approach. What characteristics of CNNs make them amenable for use with continual learning and negotiated training?

6) What was the motivation behind modifying the standard sigmoid activation function? How does the proposed custom sigmoid differ and what impact does it have on the linearity of class membership representations?

7) Explain the process through which the negotiation rate scheduler ensures balanced capacity distribution across multiple continual learning tasks. What formula is used to calculate optimal negotiation plasticity? 

8) The experimental results show differences in initial negotiation rate tuning across datasets. What factors determine the optimal starting negotiation rate for a given dataset?

9) How do the trends in the accuracy vs negotiation rate graphs inform us about the balance between plasticity and stability in continual learning? What thresholds indicate detrimental restrictions to learning new tasks?

10) The method achieves substantially higher accuracy than baseline models without negotiation. What enhancements can be made to the approach to further improve performance, especially on more complex datasets like CIFAR-100?
