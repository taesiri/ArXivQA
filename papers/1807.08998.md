# [Cross-lingual Argumentation Mining: Machine Translation (and a bit of   Projection) is All You Need!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable cross-lingual argumentation mining, i.e. training an argument mining system in one language (the source language) and applying it to another language (the target language)? The key hypothesis seems to be that using machine translation and annotation projection will allow cross-lingual transfer with minimal loss in performance compared to training and evaluating the system within the same language.Some key points:- Argumentation mining is an important but complex task, with most resources only available for English. Developing resources for new languages is expensive. - This paper explores cross-lingual transfer to overcome this resource scarcity.- Existing argumentation mining datasets are inadequate for evaluating cross-lingual transfer, due to heterogeneity or lack of complexity.- The authors create new parallel datasets by human and machine translating an existing English dataset into German, French, Spanish and Chinese.- They compare direct transfer vs annotation projection for cross-lingual transfer. - Key finding: Annotation projection works much better, achieving near in-language performance. This works with both human and cheap machine translation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using machine translation and projection can enable effective cross-lingual transfer for argumentation mining. The paper provides new datasets and experiments to evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Providing a fully parallel (English-German) human-translated version of a popular argument mining dataset of persuasive student essays. 2. Machine translating the persuasive essay dataset into German, Spanish, French, and Chinese. Both the human and machine translations contain argument annotations projected from the original English annotations.3. Performing the first evaluations of cross-lingual argument mining at the token level, using adaptations of direct transfer and annotation projection approaches. 4. Finding that annotation projection works much better than direct transfer for cross-lingual argument mining, and almost eliminates the performance drop compared to in-language models when using either human or machine translations.5. Demonstrating that current neural machine translation systems have reached a level where they can effectively substitute costly human translation even for fine-grained token-level tasks like argument mining.In summary, the key contributions are creating suitable parallel corpora for cross-lingual argument mining and showing that annotation projection with machine translation achieves strong performance, outperforming direct transfer approaches. The findings highlight the potential of machine translation for enabling cross-lingual transfer learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my understanding, the key point of the paper is that machine translation and annotation projection work much better than direct transfer for cross-lingual argumentation mining, achieving performance almost on par with in-language upper bounds.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the abstract and introduction, here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in cross-lingual argumentation mining:- Focus on token-level argument component extraction: This paper tackles the challenging task of identifying argument components at the token level across languages. Many prior works have focused on sentence-level classification or only worked monolingually.- Use of parallel corpora: The authors create new parallel corpora for argument mining by translating an existing English dataset into German, French, Spanish and Chinese. This allows direct comparison between languages and cross-lingual transfer experiments. Many prior works lack suitable parallel data. - Comparison of projection vs direct transfer: The paper systematically compares two main approaches to cross-lingual transfer - annotation projection using parallel text vs direct transfer using bilingual embeddings. It provides novel insights into their relative effectiveness for argument mining.- Leveraging machine translation: They find machine translation + projection performs nearly as well as human translation, showing the potential of cheaply created machine translated data. This is an interesting contribution given the expense of human translations.- New datasets: In addition to the translated data, the paper includes experiments on two other existing datasets. Overall, it introduces new valuable resources to the field.- Focus on truly low-resource scenarios: They strictly evaluate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer without target language data, a challenging but important setting.In summary, the paper makes excellent contributions in terms of new datasets, thorough evaluation of cross-lingual transfer techniques, and insights into the potential of machine translation. The token-level argument mining focus and findings related to projection vs direct transfer are significant advances to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:- Exploring cross-lingual argumentative relation identification, using the parallel corpora with relation annotations they created for PE and CRC. They did not address cross-lingual relation identification in this work.- Using cross-lingual multi-task learning for argument mining, with the source language as the main task and small amounts of labeled target language data. This could help improve performance in the target language.- Exploring adversarial training techniques which may help address the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue that direct transfer is prone to, though not the word order issue.- Combining projection and direct transfer, by training on a union of projected target language data and original source language data using shared representations. This could combine the benefits of both approaches.- Applying their methods to more languages beyond the ones explored in this paper, now that they have shown machine translation plus projection works well. The new PE and CRC datasets could facilitate this.- Exploring the impact of different machine translation methods/systems on the projection approach.- Analyzing the errors resulting from the projection step in more depth to develop improved projection algorithms.In summary, the main future directions are exploring cross-lingual transfer learning methods tailored to argument mining, leveraging their new multi-lingual datasets, analyzing projection errors, and expanding to more languages. Their results show machine translation plus projection is a promising approach for cross-lingual AM.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper describes adaptations of direct transfer and projection approaches for cross-lingual argumentation mining (AM). Direct transfer trains a model on source language data with bilingual embeddings and applies it to the target language. Projection projects annotations from source to target language text via word alignments, then trains on target data. Experiments compare these approaches on English, German, and Chinese AM datasets. Results show projection performs much better, nearly eliminating the cross-lingual performance drop. Machine translation plus projection works as well as human translation plus projection. Findings indicate current neural machine translation is good enough to substitute for human translation even for fine-grained token-level tasks like AM. The paper concludes projection with machine translation is an effective approach for cross-lingual AM, superior to direct transfer which suffers from out-of-vocabulary and word order issues.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper focuses on cross-lingual argumentation mining, which is the task of identifying argument components such as claims and premises in text in a target language, while only having training data in a source language. The authors note that most prior work in argumentation mining has focused on monolingual settings, especially English. They argue that being able to do cross-lingual transfer would reduce the annotation effort needed to create training data in many different languages. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) providing human translations of an existing English argumentation mining dataset into German, as well as machine translating it into German, Spanish, French and Chinese, (2) comparing two cross-lingual transfer methods - direct transfer using multilingual word embeddings and projection using parallel corpora to project annotations, and (3) showing that projection substantially outperforms direct transfer, achieving near in-language performance. They also find machine translation works as well as human translation for the projection approach. The authors conclude that machine translation and projection is an effective approach to cross-lingual transfer for argumentation mining.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper focuses on cross-lingual argumentation mining, specifically argument component extraction at the token level. The authors use suitable adaptations of two popular cross-lingual techniques - direct transfer and projection. For direct transfer, they train a system on annotated source language (L1) data using bilingual word embeddings, and apply it directly to the target language (L2) without modification. For projection, they take L1 data, align it to parallel L2 data, project annotations to L2 using the alignments, and train a system on the resulting noisy L2 data. They compare these methods on English-German and English-Chinese datasets, finding that projection performs much better than direct transfer and almost eliminates the cross-lingual performance drop, whether using human or machine translations. The paper concludes that machine translation and projection is an effective strategy for cross-lingual argument mining.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper appears to be addressing the problem of cross-lingual argumentation mining, or analyzing the structure and components of arguments across different languages. The key questions seem to be:1. How can we develop resources and methods for argumentation mining that work across languages, rather than just for English?2. What are suitable techniques for adapting argumentation mining systems trained on one language (the source language) to another language (the target language)? The paper examines two main approaches:1. Direct transfer - Training a system on source language data using language-independent features like bilingual word embeddings, and applying it directly to the target language.2. Projection - Using parallel corpora to project annotations from the source to the target language, training the system on the projected target language data.The key findings are that projection works much better than direct transfer, and using machine translation + projection can almost eliminate the loss from cross-lingual transfer. The paper also contributes new translated datasets for evaluating cross-lingual argumentation mining.In summary, the paper tackles the challenge of adapting argument mining systems across languages, with a focus on resource creation and comparing different transfer learning techniques. The main innovation seems to be showing the effectiveness of machine translation and projection for cross-lingual argument mining.
