# [Cross-lingual Argumentation Mining: Machine Translation (and a bit of   Projection) is All You Need!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable cross-lingual argumentation mining, i.e. training an argument mining system in one language (the source language) and applying it to another language (the target language)? The key hypothesis seems to be that using machine translation and annotation projection will allow cross-lingual transfer with minimal loss in performance compared to training and evaluating the system within the same language.Some key points:- Argumentation mining is an important but complex task, with most resources only available for English. Developing resources for new languages is expensive. - This paper explores cross-lingual transfer to overcome this resource scarcity.- Existing argumentation mining datasets are inadequate for evaluating cross-lingual transfer, due to heterogeneity or lack of complexity.- The authors create new parallel datasets by human and machine translating an existing English dataset into German, French, Spanish and Chinese.- They compare direct transfer vs annotation projection for cross-lingual transfer. - Key finding: Annotation projection works much better, achieving near in-language performance. This works with both human and cheap machine translation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using machine translation and projection can enable effective cross-lingual transfer for argumentation mining. The paper provides new datasets and experiments to evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Providing a fully parallel (English-German) human-translated version of a popular argument mining dataset of persuasive student essays. 2. Machine translating the persuasive essay dataset into German, Spanish, French, and Chinese. Both the human and machine translations contain argument annotations projected from the original English annotations.3. Performing the first evaluations of cross-lingual argument mining at the token level, using adaptations of direct transfer and annotation projection approaches. 4. Finding that annotation projection works much better than direct transfer for cross-lingual argument mining, and almost eliminates the performance drop compared to in-language models when using either human or machine translations.5. Demonstrating that current neural machine translation systems have reached a level where they can effectively substitute costly human translation even for fine-grained token-level tasks like argument mining.In summary, the key contributions are creating suitable parallel corpora for cross-lingual argument mining and showing that annotation projection with machine translation achieves strong performance, outperforming direct transfer approaches. The findings highlight the potential of machine translation for enabling cross-lingual transfer learning.
