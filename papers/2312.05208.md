# [ControlRoom3D: Room Generation using Semantic Proxy Rooms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05208)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes ControlRoom3D, a novel method to generate high-quality and plausible 3D room meshes given a user-defined 3D semantic proxy room layout and a text prompt describing the desired room style. The key insight is that when rendered in 2D, this proxy room provides valuable semantic and geometric guidance that can control powerful generative models to create textures and geometries aligned with the layout. To enable coherent room generation, they introduce guided panorama synthesis and a geometry alignment module leveraging information from the proxy room's 3D boxes. After initial mesh generation, a completion stage fills in missing regions from favorable viewpoints guided by projections from the proxy room. Compared to prior art, ControlRoom3D creates significantly more plausible and globally consistent room layouts which align well with the user's input. Both quantitative metrics and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component, validating that ControlRoom3D generates high-quality textured 3D room meshes that match a desired layout.
