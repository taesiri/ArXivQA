# [Self-Supervision is All You Need for Solving Rubik's Cube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether a deep neural network can learn to efficiently solve goal-oriented combinatorial problems like Rubik's Cube through a simple self-supervised training approach on random goal-based scrambles. The key hypothesis appears to be that the inherent bias of random scrambles originating from the goal state can enable a DNN to statistically infer near-optimal reverse move sequences to unscramble states back to the goal. So the main question is whether this simple method of self-supervision on goal-based random scrambles can train a neural network to efficiently find high quality solutions for problems like Rubik's Cube.In summary, the central research question/hypothesis is whether a DNN can learn to efficiently solve goal-oriented combinatorial problems through a straightforward self-supervised approach of training on random goal-based scrambles, by capitalizing on the inherent optimality bias of such scrambles.
