# [HollowNeRF: Pruning Hashgrid-Based NeRFs with Trainable Collision   Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10122)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve the rendering quality and efficiency of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by leveraging the inherent sparsity in 3D scenes? Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called HollowNeRF that aims to achieve higher rendering quality using fewer parameters compared to prior NeRF methods like Instant-NGP. The key ideas are:- Learning a 3D saliency grid during training to guide compression of dense volumetric features. This focuses model capacity on visible surfaces while pruning unnecessary internal features. - Using an ADMM pruner to enforce sparsity in the saliency grid, further eliminating unneeded features.- Employing a soft zero-skipping gate in the MLP decoder to ensure pruned features correctly map to zero density.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by exploiting scene sparsity through trainable feature pruning and collision mitigation techniques, HollowNeRF can improve the accuracy and efficiency trade-off compared to previous NeRF methods. The experiments aim to validate whether HollowNeRF achieves higher rendering quality using fewer parameters on various 3D scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing HollowNeRF, a new neural radiance field (NeRF) compression method that learns to prioritize features defining visible surfaces and prune unnecessary internal features without requiring prior knowledge of surface geometry. - Using an ADMM-based optimization framework to prune features during NeRF training and adding a soft zero-skipping gate to the MLP to ensure pruned features map to zero density.- Evaluating HollowNeRF on NeRF datasets and showing it achieves better cost-accuracy tradeoffs than state-of-the-art methods like Instant-NGP. Specifically, HollowNeRF attains comparable rendering quality to Instant-NGP while using only 31% of the parameters, or can achieve around 1dB higher PSNR while using only 56% of the parameters.In summary, the main contribution appears to be presenting a new way to compress neural radiance fields that automatically identifies and prunes invisible/internal features during training to improve the accuracy vs. parameter count tradeoff compared to prior art. The key ideas are learning a 3D saliency mask to guide pruning and using an ADMM-based optimizer to enforce sparsity constraints.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main takeaway of this paper seems to be: The authors propose HollowNeRF, a novel compression method for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that learns to prioritize important features and prune unnecessary ones, leading to improved rendering quality while using significantly fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, HollowNeRF achieves better cost-accuracy tradeoffs for compressing NeRF models by automatically sparsifying features during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief assessment of how this paper compares to other related research on improving the efficiency of neural radiance fields (NeRF):- Method: This paper proposes a new method called HollowNeRF that learns to sparsify the 3D feature grid to focus modeling capacity on visible surfaces. It uses a trainable saliency grid and an ADMM pruner. This is a novel approach compared to other NeRF compression techniques.- Key Ideas: The main ideas of pruning unimportant 3D regions and learning a saliency mask to guide compression are novel contributions not explored in prior works. Other papers have used auxiliary networks to predict geometry or relied on low-rank tensor approximations.- Performance: The experiments demonstrate HollowNeRF achieves better accuracy than Instant-NGP and other methods while using fewer parameters. The improved cost-accuracy tradeoff is a key advantage compared to prior arts.- Limitations: Like Instant-NGP, HollowNeRF may struggle with reflective and transparent surfaces. The compression gains require scenes to be mostly empty or occluded space.Overall, this paper introduces a new optimization-based compression approach for NeRFs that outperforms existing techniques. The core ideas of learning feature importance and pruning unnecessary regions via a trainable saliency grid and ADMM are novel and impactful contributions to the field. The improved accuracy and reduced model size would make HollowNeRF appealing for many practical NeRF applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:- Extending the concept of HollowNeRF to frameworks with better support for reflective surfaces, such as Nerf-OSR and Nerf-in-the-dark. The current version of HollowNeRF, like Instant-NGP, has challenges modeling objects with reflective surfaces.- Adapting HollowNeRF to scenes without the assumption of sparsity, such as those containing smoke, fire, clouds, etc. The compression gains of HollowNeRF rely on the scene being sparse with mostly empty or occluded space. It can still operate on non-sparse scenes but may regress to baseline performance without pruning.- Applying HollowNeRF to large-scale scene representations like MegaNeRF. The paper currently evaluates HollowNeRF on relatively small scenes from the NeRF synthetic and Tanks and Temples datasets. Testing its scalability to large and complex 3D worlds could be an interesting direction.- Exploring differentiable model compression techniques to sparsify the 3D saliency grid in HollowNeRF during training. The saliency grid itself provides an opportunity for model compression.- Investigating other ways to enforce sparsity in the feature domain beyond the ADMM pruner used in HollowNeRF. For example, exploring different regularization techniques or neural network architectures to induce sparsity.- Adapting HollowNeRF to video NeRF frameworks that model dynamic scenes. The current HollowNeRF is designed for static scene reconstruction and synthesis. Extending its concepts like the trainable saliency grid to dynamic settings could be valuable.In summary, the authors point to reflective surfaces, scene scalability, differentiable compression of the saliency grid, and video NeRF as interesting future work directions stemming from HollowNeRF.
