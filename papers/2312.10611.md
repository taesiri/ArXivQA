# [Bi-directional Adapter for Multi-modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10611)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing multi-modal tracking methods have two main limitations: 1) Insufficient multi-modal training data. 2) The dominant correlation between modalities is not fixed and changes dynamically in complex environments. Methods that take RGB as the dominant modality fail when other modalities become more informative. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Bi-directional Adapter for Multi-modal Tracking (BAT) to address the above limitations. The key ideas are:

1) BAT consists of two modality-specific branches (one for RGB, one for thermal infrared/TIR) that share parameters and are initialized by a frozen pre-trained foundation model. This transfers knowledge from large RGB models and does not require large multi-modal datasets.

2) A novel bi-directional adapter is introduced to mutually prompt features across the two branches, fusing complementary information between modalities. This allows dynamically adapting to the most informative modality instead of fixing one as dominant.

3) The adapter has a simple hourglass structure to reduce dimension, prompt features across branches, then restore dimensions. It adds only 0.32M extra parameters for training.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to propose an adapter-based visual prompt framework for multi-modal tracking that perceives dynamic changes in modality importance.

2) A universal bi-directional adapter that effectively cross-prompts multiple modalities with a simple and efficient structure.

3) State-of-the-art performance on RGBT234 and LaSHeR datasets. With only 0.32M extra parameters, BAT outperforms prior arts by 2.9-5.1% in terms of main metrics.

4) In-depth analysis of adapter variant designs and layer choices to explore efficient architectures.

In summary, this paper breaks the fixed modality correlation paradigm in multi-modal tracking by using a lightweight bi-directional adapter to mutually prompt features across modalities and achieve superior tracking performance.
