# [Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09748)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How do transformers perform as backbones for diffusion models of images compared to standard convolutional architectures like U-Nets?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Transformers can readily replace U-Nets as backbones for diffusion models with comparable or better performance.

2) Transformers exhibit good scaling properties as backbones for diffusion models - increasing model size and compute leads to better sample quality. 

3) Diffusion transformers, or "DiTs", can achieve state-of-the-art results on class-conditional image generation benchmarks like ImageNet when sufficiently scaled up.

The authors seem to be exploring whether the recent success of transformers in other domains like NLP can also translate over to diffusion models for images, which have so far predominantly used convolutional architectures. They design a transformer backbone tailored for latent diffusion models and systematically analyze its scaling behavior and performance compared to prior convolutional baselines. The overarching goal appears to be showing transformers are a promising backbone for scaling up diffusion models to achieve new state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new class of diffusion models called Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). The key ideas are:

- Replacing the commonly used U-Net backbone in diffusion models with a transformer architecture that operates on latent image patches. 

- Analyzing the scaling behavior and compute efficiency of these DiTs through the lens of forward pass complexity (Gflops).

- Showing that DiTs with higher Gflops, either through increased transformer depth/width or increased number of input tokens, achieve better sample quality on image generation benchmarks.

- Demonstrating that the largest DiT models outperform prior state-of-the-art diffusion models like ADM and LDM on class-conditional ImageNet generation at 256x256 and 512x512 resolutions. 

In summary, the main contribution is proposing transformers as a scalable and compute-efficient backbone architecture for diffusion models, and showing they can achieve new state-of-the-art results on competitive image generation benchmarks when sufficiently scaled up. The results suggest transformers may be a promising architecture direction for diffusion models going forward.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), a new class of diffusion models for image generation that replace the commonly used U-Net backbone with a transformer architecture and shows these models achieve state-of-the-art image quality on ImageNet while being more compute-efficient.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in generative image modeling:

- This paper focuses on using transformers as the backbone architecture for diffusion models. Most prior diffusion models for image generation have used convolutional neural networks like U-Nets as the backbone. Using transformers is a novel architectural choice.

- The paper studies the scaling properties of these "Diffusion Transformers" (DiTs) in terms of model size, compute (flops), and image quality. Prior work has studied scaling of other generative model architectures like GANs and autoregressive models, but there has been less analysis on scaling of diffusion models specifically.

- The DiT models are shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on class-conditional image generation benchmarks like ImageNet at 256x256 and 512x512 resolution. The largest DiT achieves an FID of 2.27 on 256x256 ImageNet, outperforming prior diffusion models and GANs.

- The analysis shows transformer-based diffusion models can efficiently scale to large sizes and efficiently use compute. This is consistent with observations in other domains like NLP where transformers exhibit excellent scaling properties.

- The DiT models are compared against other leading diffusion models like ADM and LDM which use convolutional U-Net backbones. The comparisons show the advantages of the transformer backbone in terms of scaling and final image quality.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of transformers for diffusion models. It shows they can achieve excellent results by efficiently scaling up model size and compute. The work demonstrates diffusion models need not be confined to convolutional architectures, and that transformers are a promising backbone choice. The state-of-the-art results and scaling analysis significantly advance research on generative modeling with diffusion models.
