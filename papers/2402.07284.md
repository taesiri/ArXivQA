# [CLIPPER: Robust Data Association without an Initial Guess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Data association is a critical step in many estimation problems in robotics, such as point cloud registration. However, sensor noise and outliers make identifying correct correspondences between data extremely challenging, especially when no good initial guess of the solution is available. Existing techniques either attempt to distinguish inliers from outliers during estimation, which is difficult in practice, or use approximate or randomized approaches for correspondence selection that lack guarantees. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a graph-theoretic formulation for robust data association that selects the largest set of mutually consistent correspondences without requiring an initial guess. Specifically:

1. They formulate the novel Densest Edge-Weighted Clique (DEWC) problem that seeks to find the densest subgraph in a consistency graph that satisfies the clique constraint. This allows fully leveraging edge weights while guaranteeing joint consistency.

2. They introduce the Maximum Spectral Radius Clique (MSRC) problem as a relaxation of DEWC that has an empirically large basin of attraction.

3. They provide a convex semidefinite relaxation of MSRC that can recover globally optimal solutions.

4. They develop a fast, scalable algorithm called CLIPPER, based on homotopy and projected gradient ascent, that optimizes the MSRC efficiently.

Main Contributions:

- The novel DEWC formulation for highly robust pairwise data association
- The MSRC relaxation with desirable properties 
- A convex SDP relaxation that empirically finds global MSRC solutions
- The CLIPPER algorithm that frequently achieves near-optimal solutions in milliseconds

Experiments:
Experiments on point cloud registration, both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. CLIPPER remains robust up to 95% outliers while prior arts fail at 80%. The SDP relaxation provides globally optimal solutions. CLIPPER scales to problems with 8000 associations in under 1 second.
