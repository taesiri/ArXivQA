# [Quantifying Contamination in Evaluating Code Generation Capabilities of   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on code generation benchmarks. However, there are growing concerns about potential contamination of these benchmarks from the pretraining and finetuning data.
- While contamination has been studied for natural language tasks, there has been limited research quantifying it for code generation. This is critical to understand the robustness and reliability of LLMs for programming.
- Code has key differences from natural language that warrant a deeper examination - syntax and naming of functions/variables can vary across equivalent programs. So traditional surface-level comparisons may be inadequate.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a pipeline to precisely measure overlap between popular code generation benchmarks (MBPP, HumanEval) and pretraining corpora (\textsc{Pile}, \textsc{Stack}) using both surface-level and semantic-level similarity.
- Surface similarity is computed using Levenshtein distance. Semantic similarity uses the Dolos toolkit to compare abstract syntax trees.
- An aggregated similarity score combines both surface and semantic similarity. Overlapping programs are identified across different similarity thresholds.
- Data contamination is quantified based on similarity scores and the frequency of observing similar solutions during training.

Key Findings:
- There is significant contamination in both MBPP (up to 20.8\%) and HumanEval (up to 18.9\%) by the \textsc{Stack}. Relatively less for \textsc{Pile} (3.6\% on MBPP).
- Models perform much better on questions with seen vs unseen solutions, indicating memorization. The gaps can be over 50\% in accuracy.
- After de-contamination, model rankings don't change but performance gaps reduce. Contamination may thus exaggerate differences.
- Larger models memorize better. But there's no clear correlation between problem difficulty/length and memorization.

Contributions:
- Precisely quantified data contamination in popular code generation benchmarks using both surface and semantic similarity matching. 
- Showed significant memorization effects from seeing solutions during training through accuracy improvements.
- Released matched files to enable further research on understanding generalization of code LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper quantifies data contamination in popular code generation benchmarks by exhaustively searching for overlap between their solutions and the training data of several language models, finding significant memorization that inflates model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) Performing a comprehensive study to quantify data contamination in popular code generation benchmarks like MBPP and HumanEval with respect to the pretraining corpora like the Pile and the Stack. 

2) Proposing a pipeline to measure the overlap between code generation benchmarks and pretraining corpus using both surface-level string matching and semantic-level AST matching.

3) Precisely quantifying the percentage of benchmark solutions that are seen during pretraining for several model series like StarCoder, Pythia and CodeGen-NL.

4) Showing that models perform significantly better on benchmark questions where similar solutions exist in the pretraining data, indicating memorization.

5) Analyzing the impact of factors like model size, question difficulty and length on memorization and generalization.

6) Releasing matched files from their pipeline to facilitate future research in this area.

In summary, the key contribution is performing an in-depth analysis to quantify data contamination in code generation benchmarks and showing that it leads to memorization and inflated performance estimates of language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Data contamination - The paper focuses on measuring and quantifying data contamination, which refers to overlap between test/evaluation data and the training data used by models. This can lead to inflated performance estimates.

- Code generation - The paper looks specifically at potential data contamination issues in benchmarks and models for code generation tasks.

- Memorization vs generalization - The paper analyzes the extent to which models are simply memorizing solutions seen during training vs generalizing to solve new problems.

- Similarity measurement - Methods used in the paper to match programs based on surface-form similarity (e.g. Levenshtein distance) as well as semantic similarity of code.

- Popular benchmarks - The analysis focuses on potential contamination in widely-used code generation benchmarks like MBPP and HumanEval.

- Model training data - The paper examines contamination from two code training datasets - the Pile and StackOverflow dataset - used to train code generation models.

- Quantification and analysis - Key goals are to precisely quantify contamination overlap in test sets and analyze factors affecting memorization/generalization.

So in summary, the key topics are data contamination, code generation, memorization vs generalization, program similarity measurement, benchmark analysis, and precise quantification of overlap.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using both surface-level string matching and semantic-level AST matching to identify similar programs. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method? When would one be preferred over the other?

2. The aggregated similarity score takes the maximum of the surface-level and semantic-level scores. What other aggregation methods could be used instead (e.g. averages) and what would be the tradeoffs? 

3. When quantifying contamination, the paper uses exact string matches to count the number of times a solution has been "seen". How could fuzzy matching be incorporated to account for small variations in solutions? What challenges would this introduce?

4. For computational efficiency, the semantic matching is only run on the top 500 surface-level matches. How was this threshold determined? What analysis could be done to systematically set this threshold? 

5. The paper studies contamination in LLMs trained on the Pile and Stack datasets. What other code dataset characteristics (size, domain diversity, etc.) may impact measured contamination rates?

6. The analysis decouples memorization and problem difficulty using different model comparisons. What other analyses could strengthen the argument that observed score gaps are due to memorization rather than problem difficulty?  

7. What other model architectures besides standard transformer-based LLMs could be studied? Would the proposed quantification method work for non-autoregressive or reinforcement learning models?

8. The analysis studies model performance on seen vs unseen problems, but does not dive deeper into model outputs. How could human evaluations of model outputs give further insights into memorization?

9. The paper release files enabling future benchmark contamination analyses. What challenges exist in keeping these up-to-date as new benchmarks and datasets emerge?

10. The analysis relies on public model training data, limiting the approach's applicability. How could similar analyses be done for commercial models with private datasets? What assumptions would need to be made?
