# [Intelligent Collective Escape of Swarm Robots Based on a Novel   Fish-inspired Self-adaptive Approach with Neurodynamic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling a swarm of robots to collectively escape threats in dynamic environments. Specific limitations of prior approaches include: 1) only considering collision-free or static environments, 2) requiring robots to have full knowledge of the environment, 3) being computationally expensive for large swarm sizes. The goal is to develop a fish-inspired approach where robots have limited sensing and no inter-robot communication, yet can still achieve efficient and adaptive collective escape behaviors.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel fish-inspired self-adaptive approach for collective robot escape. The key components are:

1) A behavioral model based on fish schools, where robots transition between align, escape and follow modes depending on threats detected. A hierarchical organization is used to reduce complexity.

2) A bio-inspired neural network (BINN) that generates virtual attractive and repulsive forces for collision avoidance. The BINN models the environment and dynamically adjusts neural activities based on threats, obstacles and robots.

3) A neurodynamics-based self-adaptive mechanism that controls the ratio of attractive to repulsive forces based on neural activities, enabling adaptation to changing environments.

Main Contributions:

1) A fish-inspired collective escape approach suited for robot swarms with only local sensing and no communication.

2) A BINN approach to generate collision-free virtual forces that guide robots to escape threats. The network converges to stable states without needing learning.

3) A self-adaptive mechanism based on neural dynamics that improves adaptability to complex and dynamic environments.

The proposed approach is shown via simulations and real robot experiments to enable efficient, adaptive and safe collective escape in varied environments involving static obstacles, moving obstacles and new threats. Comparisons show clear advantages over prior methods in success rate, escape time and energy use.
