# [GenCeption: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs with Unlabeled Unimodal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Evaluating rapidly advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is challenging as existing benchmarks rely on costly annotated multimodal datasets that struggle to keep pace. 
- Popular benchmarks also risk training data contamination.

Proposed Solution - GenCeption:
- A new annotation-free framework to evaluate MLLMs using only unimodal data. 
- Iteratively generates and describes non-textual samples across modalities, quantifying inter-modality semantic coherence and drift across iterations.
- Lower semantic drift indicates better consistency in maintaining semantics across modalities, while higher drift correlates with increased hallucination.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes GenCeption - an intuitive and scalable MLLM evaluation approach using only unimodal data.
- Defines GC@T metric to quantify semantic drift across modalities over iterations.
- Empirically validates strong correlation between GC@T and existing multimodal benchmarks.
- Enables scalable and continuous evaluation of rapidly improving MLLMs without reliance on costly annotated datasets. 
- Allows use of unseen unimodal data, minimizing training contamination risks.

In summary, the paper introduces GenCeption, an innovative annotation-free evaluation framework for Multimodal LLMs that only leverages unimodal data. By quantifying inter-modality semantic drift over iterative generations, it effectively measures semantic coherence and susceptibility to hallucination.
