# [Enhancing Tracking Robustness with Auxiliary Adversarial Defense   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17976)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Adversarial attacks can significantly degrade the performance of visual object trackers by adding imperceptible perturbations to input images. However, there is a lack of research on designing adversarial defense methods specifically for object tracking. Existing defense methods designed for image classification cannot be directly applied to tracking due to differences in input (continuous image sequences) and network architecture. Also, adversarial training is commonly used for defense but requires retraining the entire tracking model, which is computationally expensive. Furthermore, defense methods should not reduce the tracking speed too much.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes DuaLossDef, an auxiliary pre-processing defense network, that eliminates adversarial perturbations from the template and search regions in object tracking. DuaLossDef is based on a U-Net architecture and optimized via adversarial training with Dua-Loss. Dua-Loss combines a classification loss for coarse localization and regression loss for precise localization. This allows generating adversarial samples that attack both branches. DuaLossDef is designed as a plug-and-play module placed before the tracker backbone, avoiding costly retraining.

Main Contributions:
1) First work on adversarial defense specifically designed for object tracking. DuaLossDef demonstrates strong defense capability against various attacks.

2) Excellent transferability - can enhance robustness of trackers like SiamRPN++ in a plug-and-play manner without retraining them.

3) High efficiency - processes at 5ms per frame. Can be used with high-speed trackers without much overhead.

The effectiveness of DuaLossDef is validated extensively on OTB100, LaSOT and VOT2018 datasets. It maintains high accuracy against adaptive attacks, transfers reliably across trackers, and preserves performance on clean samples.
