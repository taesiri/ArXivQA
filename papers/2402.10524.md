# [LLM Comparator: Visual Analytics for Side-by-Side Evaluation of Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging since setting ground truth responses is impractical. A common approach is to use automatic side-by-side evaluation, where another LLM judges the quality of responses from two models. 
- However, analyzing results from automatic side-by-side evaluations raises interpretability and sensemaking challenges. Users want to understand when and why a model performs better or worse, and how the responses qualitatively differ.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents LLM Comparator, a novel interactive visual analytics tool for analyzing side-by-side LLM evaluation results.
- It provides coordinated views between aggregated metrics and individual examples. This enables users to identify areas of interest and inspect specific prompts and responses.
- Key interactive features:
  - Interactive table for inspecting individual rating details 
  - Visualizations for identifying model performance across prompt categories (when it performs better)
  - Rationale clusters to understand common themes in raters' decisions (why decisions are made) 
  - N-grams and custom functions to uncover qualitative differences in responses (how they differ)

Main Contributions:
- Identified challenges and goals in analyzing automatic side-by-side LLM evaluations through formative research
- Designed and developed an interactive tool tailored for this problem space with novel features like rationale clustering
- Evaluated the tool through an observational study, revealing how it supports forming and validating hypotheses about model behaviors
- The tool has over 400 users at Google, analyzing over 1,000 experiments. It has been integrated into production pipelines.

In summary, the paper presents a specialized visual analytics system to help researchers and engineers interpret automatic evaluation results to optimize LLMs. Both aggregated statistics and qualitative analyses are seamlessly connected through coordinated interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents LLM Comparator, a novel interactive visual analytics tool that enables users to analyze results from automatic side-by-side evaluations of large language models in order to understand when, why, and how one model performs better or worse than a baseline model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of LLM Comparator, a novel interactive visualization tool for analyzing the results of automatic side-by-side evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Key aspects of the contribution include:

- The tool enables users to interactively analyze large-scale evaluation results to understand when and why one LLM performs better or worse than a baseline model, and how their responses qualitatively differ.

- It supports workflows to inspect individual prompt-response pairs in detail as well as get overview visualizations of model performance across categories of prompts. 

- Unique features include highlighting of overlapping words in responses, summarization of lengthy rating rationales, visualization of performance by prompt category, clustering of rationales, and custom functions to compare responses.

- The tool has been successfully integrated into evaluation pipelines and adopted by over 400 users at Google, analyzing over 1,000 distinct side-by-side experiments.

- An observational study with 6 participants demonstrates how the tool supports forming and validating hypotheses about model behaviors during evaluation.

In summary, the key contribution is the design, development, and evaluation of an interactive visualization tool tailored for the analysis of automatic side-by-side evaluations of LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What were the key limitations identified in current practices for analyzing automatic side-by-side evaluation results that motivated the development of this new tool?

2. Why was facilitating the connection between aggregated metrics and detailed inspection of individual examples an important design goal (DG1)? How does the tool aim to support this?

3. The paper outlines three key analytical questions (DG2) - when, why and how the models differ. Can you explain the specific visualization components that aim to answer each of these questions?

4. What novel computational approach was used for generating the rationale clusters? What were the motivations for using this approach compared to more traditional clustering techniques? 

5. The custom functions allow users to define regular expressions or JavaScript functions to analyze model responses. Can you suggest some examples of advanced functions a user might define to uncover interesting behavioral differences?

6. What opportunities were identified in the user study discussions for enhancing the workflows for analyzing custom metrics computed from model responses? What practical challenges need to be addressed?

7. The user study revealed some common usage strategies - can you describe the example-first deep dive strategy and how the tool aims to support it?

8. How does the ability to test for known undesirable model behaviors using the tool features fit into practitioners' model evaluation workflows?

9. What future opportunities were identified in the user studies for improving the rationale clustering pipeline and making it more robust?

10. How does this tool differ in scope and goals compared to other recently introduced tools like ChainForge and EvalLM that also aim to support LLM evaluation?
