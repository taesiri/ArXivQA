# [An Optimal Control Formulation of Tool Affordance Applied to Impact   Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humans can use tools skillfully by adapting their body posture and grip to afford the requirements of impact-aware tasks like hammering. Robots lack this capability.
- Existing methods learn tool use in separate grasping and manipulation phases rather than considering the affordances. They also lack biomechanics insights.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate an optimal control problem with constraints to plan motions that consider tool affordances. 
- Tool affordance is modeled as a spatial constraint on the range of viable grasp locations.
- Cost function includes terms to maximize directional velocity manipulability for efficient impact, match orientations, reach desired poses.
- Use ADMM within iLQR to efficiently solve the constrained optimization.
- Apply to hammering task by anticipating grasp location based on subsequent hitting.

Contributions:
- Novel optimal control method using ADMM-iLQR that incorporates tool affordance constraints and directional manipulability.
- Compare manipulability metrics - directional manipulability performs best.
- Demonstrate approach in simulations and real robot hammering experiment. Robot automatically chooses grasp configuration based on later hammering.
- Analysis shows proposed method leads to larger nail insertion depths signifying greater hammering impact force than alternatives.

In summary, the key idea is to develop a robotic motion planning approach that considers how tool affordances and grip configuration influence efficient use of tools for impact-aware tasks. The method is shown to work well on a real robot hammering task.
