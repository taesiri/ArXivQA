# [HNeRV: A Hybrid Neural Representation for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02633)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an efficient neural video representation that combines the benefits of implicit and explicit methods. Specifically, the paper proposes a hybrid neural video representation called HNeRV that uses:- A learnable encoder to generate compact, content-adaptive embeddings for each frame (similar to explicit methods).- A learnable decoder modeled on each video to reconstruct frames from the embeddings (similar to implicit methods). The key hypothesis is that by combining tiny content-adaptive embeddings with a video-specific decoder, HNeRV can achieve better video reconstruction, faster convergence, and improved generalizability compared to fully implicit methods like NeRV. The embeddings provide a stronger visual prior while most information is still stored compactly in the decoder weights.The paper evaluates this hypothesis through extensive experiments showing HNeRV outperforms NeRV and other baselines on metrics like PSNR, convergence speed, and interpolation. It also demonstrates the potential of HNeRV for tasks like video compression and inpainting. Overall, the core research question is how to design an efficient hybrid neural video representation merging the strengths of implicit and explicit approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing HNeRV, a hybrid neural representation for videos that combines the benefits of implicit and explicit video representations. - Designing a learnable encoder to generate content-adaptive embeddings as input to the decoder, improving reconstruction quality and convergence speed compared to methods with fixed embeddings like NeRV.- Introducing HNeRV decoder blocks with larger kernels and wider channels in later layers to evenly distribute model parameters, enabling better storage of high-resolution video details. - Demonstrating the effectiveness of HNeRV for video reconstruction, achieving higher PSNR than NeRV and faster convergence.- Showing that HNeRV is simple, fast, and flexible for video decoding compared to traditional codecs and prior learning-based methods.- Exploring the use of HNeRV for downstream tasks like video compression and inpainting, where it is competitive or outperforms previous methods.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the hybrid HNeRV representation that combines the strengths of implicit and explicit approaches for improved video reconstruction, decoding, compression, and generalization to downstream tasks. The redesigned architecture and content-adaptive embeddings are key innovations enabling these advantages.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a hybrid neural video representation method called HNeRV. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Compared to implicit video representations like NeRV and E-NeRV, HNeRV uses a learnable encoder to generate content-adaptive embeddings rather than fixed positional embeddings. This allows it to achieve better video reconstruction quality, faster convergence during training, and better generalization for video interpolation.- Compared to explicit video autoencoders, HNeRV uses a very compact embedding to store most information in the decoder network. This allows it to leverage model compression techniques for efficient video compression while maintaining simplicity.- Compared to learned video compression methods like DVC and ELF-VC, HNeRV has a much simpler encoding/decoding pipeline based on feedforward networks rather than complex recurrent architectures. This allows very fast decoding. However, HNeRV may not reach the rate-distortion performance of these specialized video codecs.- For video inpainting, HNeRV demonstrates competitive performance to recent specialized methods like IIVI while using only internal learning on individual videos rather than large external datasets. This shows the potential of the representation for video restoration.- Overall, HNeRV strikes a balance between the reconstruction quality and generalization of explicit methods, the efficiency and compression ability of implicit methods, and the decoding speed of traditional video codecs. It makes a strong case for hybrid neural representations compared to purely implicit or explicit approaches. However, it remains limited in terms of compression performance on complex videos.In summary, HNeRV pushes the boundaries of neural video representations in several ways, but there is still room for improvement, especially in modeling complex scene dynamics for compression. The exploration of hybrid approaches is an interesting direction for future research.
