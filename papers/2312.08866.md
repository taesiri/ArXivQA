# [MCANet: Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-Scale Cross-Axis Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08866)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new network called Multi-scale Cross-Axis Attention Network (MCANet) for efficient and accurate medical image segmentation. The key innovation is a lightweight decoder module called Multi-scale Cross-Axis Attention (MCA). MCA effectively captures both local details and global context by combining multi-scale convolutional features and cross-axis attention. Specifically, MCA contains two parallel branches of axial attention, each applied along one spatial dimension (horizontal/vertical). In each branch, multi-scale 1D convolutions aggregate features at different receptive fields. Then cross-attention is computed between the two branches to build interactions and further integrate contextual information. Compared to standard axial attention, the cross-axis design and multi-scale convolutions make MCA more suitable to handle variations of lesion/organ sizes and blurry boundaries in medical images. 

The MCA decoder is built upon a computation-friendly CNN backbone called MSCAN. The resulting MCANet with only 4M+ parameters achieves new state-of-the-art performance on skin lesion segmentation, cell segmentation, abdominal multi-organ segmentation and polyp segmentation. It also has much lower computational complexity than most previous best-performing methods. Experiments demonstrate MCANet's efficiency in encoding both local details and global context, which results in more accurate segmentation, especially for tiny structures and blurred lesion boundaries. The impressive results on various tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed MCA module.
