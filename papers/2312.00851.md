# [Physics Inspired Criterion for Pruning-Quantization Joint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to their huge computational and memory demands. Network pruning and quantization are two popular techniques to address this, but most prior works apply them separately in a disjointed manner, which leads to sub-optimal performance. Developing an automatic, hardware-friendly, and interpretable joint pruning-quantization method remains an open challenge. 

Key Idea:
The authors draw an analogy between elasticity dynamics (ED) in physics and model compression (MC) in deep learning to develop a novel physics-inspired criterion for pruning-quantization joint learning (PIC-PQ). Specifically, they establish a connection between Hooke's law in ED and importance ranking of filters in MC:

1) The deformation of an elastomer in ED is linearly related to its elasticity modulus (EM). Similarly, the importance distribution of a filter is linearly related to its filter property (FP) via a learnable scale. The FP is defined as the rank of feature maps, which is shown to be stable.  

2) To enable cross-layer ranking, a relative shift variable is added. This results in the physics-inspired criterion (PIC) for ranking filter importance globally.

3) For quantization, bitwidths are automatically assigned based on layer sparsity and hardware constraints. Structural pruning is used for hardware friendliness.

Main Contributions:

- Establish an analogy between ED and MC to develop a physics-inspired interpretable PIC for joint pruning-quantization
- Derive PIC from Hooke's law to linearly relate filter importance and FP 
- Extend PIC with relative shift for cross-layer ranking 
- Validate PIC from a mathematical perspective using Lipschitz continuity  
- Automate bitwidth assignment based on layer sparsity and hardware constraints
- Achieve state-of-the-art pruning-quantization results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed idea

The paper provides a novel perspective to joint model compression by connecting it to physics concepts, leading to an interpretable and effective solution. The automation and hardware-friendliness are additional advantages over prior arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel physics inspired criterion for pruning-quantization joint learning of deep neural networks, where an analogy is drawn between elasticity dynamics and model compression to explore filter importance ranking and compression policy assignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a novel physics inspired criterion for pruning-quantization joint learning (PIC-PQ), which is explored from an analogy drawn between elasticity dynamics (ED) and model compression (MC). This increases the feature interpretability of model compression.

2. Specifically, it establishes a linear relationship between the filters' importance distribution and filter property (FP) derived from Hooke's law in ED. It further extends this with a relative shift variable to rank filters globally across layers. Additionally, an objective function is provided to demonstrate the viability of PIC from a mathematical perspective. 

3. It introduces available maximum bitwidth and penalty factor in quantization bitwidth assignment to ensure feasibility and flexibility. 

4. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that PIC-PQ achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and bit-operations (BOPs) compression ratio. For example, it obtains 54.96× BOPs compression ratio on ResNet56 on CIFAR10 with only 0.10% accuracy drop and 53.24× BOPs compression ratio on ResNet18 on ImageNet with 0.61% accuracy drop.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a physics inspired criterion to achieve interpretable, automatic and hardware-friendly pruning-quantization joint learning for deep neural networks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Pruning-quantization joint learning - The paper proposes a joint approach to pruning and quantization for model compression, as opposed to doing them separately.

- Physics inspired criterion (PIC) - The core contribution of the paper, proposing a physics-based criterion to guide pruning and quantization in an interpretable way, based on an analogy with elasticity dynamics.

- Filter property (FP) - A measure of filter importance based on the rank of feature maps that is used in the PIC. Stays stable like the elasticity modulus.

- Deformation scale - A learnable parameter 'a' in the PIC that determines how filter importance changes, similar to deformation in elastic materials.

- Relative shift variable - Parameter 'b' introduced to extend ranking of filters across layers globally. 

- Feature interpretability - The PIC framework aims to increase interpretability of model compression by encoding knowledge of filter importance.

- Bit operations (BOPs) - Metric used to measure overall compression from pruning and quantization.

- Hooke's law - Fundamental law of elasticity that inspired the formulation of the physics-based PIC criterion.

So in summary, key ideas include drawing an analogy with physics/elasticity, proposing an interpretable criterion for joint compression, and measuring compression in terms of bit operations. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes drawing an analogy between elasticity dynamics (ED) and model compression (MC). Can you elaborate more on the similarities and differences between these two fields that make this analogy sensible? What are some limitations of directly applying concepts from ED to MC?

2. The paper establishes a relationship between filter importance and filter property (FP) based on Hooke's law. What would be some alternative choices for quantifying FP, and how might they impact the performance of the proposed method? 

3. The paper introduces a relative shift variable to extend the ranking of filters from individual layers to globally across layers. What is the intuition behind this? How does this global view differ from previous filter ranking methods? 

4. The paper defines filter property (FP) based on the rank of feature maps. Why is rank a suitable metric compared to other statistics of the feature maps? How sensitive is the method to the specific choice of input images used to estimate FP?

5. The paper gives an optimization objective based on Lipschitz continuity to justify the proposed physics-inspired criterion. Can you explain the derivation of this objective in more detail? What assumptions are made?

6. For quantization bitwidth assignment, the paper introduces concepts of maximum bitwidth and penalty factor. How do these impact the tradeoff between accuracy and compression ratio? How might they be set optimally?

7. The experiments show that directly applying the proposed method with fixed bitwidths leads to worse accuracy than jointly searching bitwidths. Why might this joint search help compared to a simple two-stage approach?

8. Ablation studies suggest that searching the a-b pairs only once can work reasonably well. Why might the subset assumption introduced help explain this? When might this assumption not hold?

9. The method is based on structured pruning, which is hardware friendly. How difficult would it be to extend this method to unstructured pruning scenarios? What modifications would be required?

10. The analogy with ED aims to increase interpretability. Do you think the proposed method really improves interpretability, compared with other state-of-the-art techniques? How else could the interpretability be further improved?
