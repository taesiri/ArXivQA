# [What Makes Math Word Problems Challenging for LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Math word problems (MWPs) are challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they require linguistic, mathematical, and real-world reasoning abilities. 
- Prior work has focused on evaluating LLMs on MWP datasets or using techniques like prompting to improve performance, but there lacks an in-depth analysis of what exactly makes MWPs difficult for LLMs.

Methodology:
- Use the high-quality GSM8K dataset of human-generated MWPs. Query several LLMs for solutions and measure success rates.
- Extract features that capture linguistic complexity, conceptual complexity, and real-world knowledge requirements. Features include length, readability, math operations, etc.
- Train classifiers on subsets of questions that are always/never solved correctly to predict if an unseen question will be answered correctly by a given LLM.
- Analyze feature importance to understand impact on LLM success.

Key Findings:
- Questions with more math operations, less common numbers, longer length, lower readability, and need for external knowledge tend to be more challenging.
- Classifiers achieve only moderate accuracy in predicting if questions will be solved, indicating difficulty of this task.
- Feature analysis confirms linguistic complexity, diversity of math operations, unfamiliar numbers, and need for world knowledge negatively impact success rates.

Main Contributions:
- First in-depth feature-based analysis to identify specific characteristics of MWPs that make them difficult for LLMs.
- Extensive experiments with multiple classifier models and LLMs validate identified challenging aspects of MWPs. 
- Provides concrete direction for modifying questions to simplify and better evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates what linguistic, mathematical, and real-world knowledge characteristics make math word problems challenging for large language models to solve correctly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper conducts an in-depth analysis to identify key characteristics of math word problems (MWPs) that make them challenging for large language models (LLMs) to solve correctly. Specifically, it extracts features spanning the linguistic complexity, conceptual complexity, and real-world knowledge requirements of MWPs. It then trains statistical classifiers on these features to predict whether specific MWPs will be solved correctly by different LLMs. The analysis provides insights into which features are most indicative of the difficulties faced by LLMs in solving MWPs. A key finding is that lengthy questions with low readability, a high diversity of math operations, and a need for external real-world knowledge tend to be the most challenging for LLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is the in-depth feature-based analysis to uncover what makes math word problems difficult for large language models. This sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for mathematical reasoning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses feature-based classifiers to predict whether an LLM can solve a math word problem correctly. What are some of the limitations of using traditional classification models like logistic regression and random forests, compared to more complex neural network models? Could the prediction accuracy be improved with deeper models?

2. The linguistic, mathematical, and real-world knowledge features seem to capture important aspects of what makes MWPs difficult for LLMs. Are there any other feature types you would propose adding to the feature set to further improve classification performance?

3. The authors perform ablation studies to show mathematical features alone are most predictive for some LLMs. However, for other LLMs linguistic or world knowledge features are more important. What could explain these differences in relative feature importance across models?  

4. The clustering analysis in Table 5 shows strong negative correlations between linguistic complexity and success rate when controlling for math features. What are some ways this analysis could be expanded or improved to better establish causal relationships?

5. The authors test their approach on the GSM8K dataset. How do you think the methodology would need to be adapted to work on other MWP datasets like AQuA-RAT or DolphinMath? What challenges might arise?

6. This study focuses only on predicting binary success/failure on each question. Could you extend it to predict more granular quality metrics like solution fluency or correctness? What additional features might help with that?

7. The feature set contains 23 features. Do you think collecting and testing even more features could lead to better prediction performance? Or is there a risk of overfitting with too many features compared to the dataset size?

8. The authors query each LLM multiple times per question to estimate success rates. How sensitive do you think the overall analysis is to the specific number of queries used? Should more queries be used for better stability?

9. What are some of the ethical considerations around developing systems to automatically predict if LLMs will fail or succeed on certain inputs? How could this methodology be misused?

10. The authors mention their approach could help inform modifications to questions to improve LLM performance. Can you propose creative ways the feature importance knowledge could be leveraged to automatically generate such improvements?
