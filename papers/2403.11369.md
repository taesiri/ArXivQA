# [What Makes Math Word Problems Challenging for LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Math word problems (MWPs) are challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they require linguistic, mathematical, and real-world reasoning abilities. 
- Prior work has focused on evaluating LLMs on MWP datasets or using techniques like prompting to improve performance, but there lacks an in-depth analysis of what exactly makes MWPs difficult for LLMs.

Methodology:
- Use the high-quality GSM8K dataset of human-generated MWPs. Query several LLMs for solutions and measure success rates.
- Extract features that capture linguistic complexity, conceptual complexity, and real-world knowledge requirements. Features include length, readability, math operations, etc.
- Train classifiers on subsets of questions that are always/never solved correctly to predict if an unseen question will be answered correctly by a given LLM.
- Analyze feature importance to understand impact on LLM success.

Key Findings:
- Questions with more math operations, less common numbers, longer length, lower readability, and need for external knowledge tend to be more challenging.
- Classifiers achieve only moderate accuracy in predicting if questions will be solved, indicating difficulty of this task.
- Feature analysis confirms linguistic complexity, diversity of math operations, unfamiliar numbers, and need for world knowledge negatively impact success rates.

Main Contributions:
- First in-depth feature-based analysis to identify specific characteristics of MWPs that make them difficult for LLMs.
- Extensive experiments with multiple classifier models and LLMs validate identified challenging aspects of MWPs. 
- Provides concrete direction for modifying questions to simplify and better evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities.
