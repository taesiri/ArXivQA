# [FALCON: FLOP-Aware Combinatorial Optimization for Neural Network Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modern neural networks have huge computational demands, making deployment difficult on resource-constrained devices. Network pruning reduces model size and computational cost while maintaining performance. Most pruning methods focus on reducing number of non-zero weights (NNZ), often neglecting other important metrics like inference time and energy usage which depend on number of floating point operations (FLOPs). 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FALCON, a novel optimization-based framework for network pruning that incorporates constraints on both NNZ and FLOPs. This allows direct control over model accuracy, FLOPs and sparsity. Key components are:

1) An integer linear program (ILP) that handles NNZ and FLOP constraints for pruning. The authors provide an efficient custom algorithm to solve the ILP's relaxation.  

2) A discrete first-order optimization method that approximately solves the ILP in each iteration. By exploiting problem structure like the Hessian's low-rank property, FALCON scales to large models.

3) A multi-stage procedure that gradually tightens the FLOP and NNZ budgets over iterations. This refine the quadratic approximation of the loss for better accuracy.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates network pruning as optimizing accuracy subject to FLOP and sparsity constraints, enabling direct control over critical resource usage metrics.

- Proposes an ILP model for magnitude pruning under joint FLOP and NNZ budgets. Provides a highly efficient custom algorithm to solve the ILP.

- Develops a discrete first-order method that leverages the ILP solver to prune networks with millions of parameters. Exploits low-rank structure for efficiency.

- Introduces a multi-stage approach that iteratively improves the quality of the local quadratic approximation used internally. Enhances accuracy of the final pruned network.  

- Experiments show FALCON outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods substantially in terms of accuracy under a fixed FLOP budget. Also demonstrates advantages in gradual pruning.
