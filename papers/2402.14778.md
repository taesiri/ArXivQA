## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Instruction tuning (IT) helps teach large language models (LLMs) to follow arbitrary instructions, but most research has focused on English. Studying multilingual IT is important for extending capabilities to other languages.

- Two key open questions: (1) What factors influence successful cross-lingual transfer when training only uses English data? (2) What are the capabilities and limitations of this zero-shot cross-lingual approach?

Methodology
- Compare multiple LLM configurations: English-centric vs multilingual pretraining, model size, IT dataset size, finetuning methods.

- Devise a thorough evaluation strategy with surface metrics, manual inspection, and GPT-3.5 scoring. Use a balanced set of tasks. Study impact of task complexity changes.

Key Findings
- Cross-lingual transfer works if multilinguality is used for hyperparameter tuning and with enough IT data. Helpful responses generated in other languages.

- Main challenge is lower factuality in non-English languages. Occasional fluency/logical errors. Code-switching is infrequent.

- Performance reduces on some language-heavy tasks. Errors in calculation or US-centric knowledge.

- Models can mostly handle complex instructions in other languages but struggle with certain formatting.

Contributions  
- First systematic study of factors influencing zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in IT.

- Multi-facet evaluation methodology to deeply analyze capabilities and limitations.

- Analysis highlights critical role of hyperparameter tuning and data size for multilingual IT.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a systematic study of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in instruction tuning of large language models, analyzing the influence of model configuration choices and devising a multi-facet evaluation strategy to assess capabilities and limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper conducts a systematic study of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in instruction tuning, when an LLM is tuned solely on English instruction data and then tested on user prompts in other languages without any additional adaptation. 

2) The paper investigates the influence of various factors like model size, instruction data size, adaptation strategy etc. on the success of cross-lingual transfer.

3) The paper devises a multi-facet evaluation methodology to analyze the capabilities and limitations of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, including surface metrics, manual inspection, and GPT-3.5 based evaluation.

4) Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that successful cross-lingual transfer is possible in instruction tuning even with English-centric training, but requires careful hyperparameter tuning and large instruction tuning data.

5) The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the quality of zero-shot multilingual instruction following, highlighting strengths like comprehension and helpfulness, and weaknesses like lower factuality.

In summary, the key contribution is a systematic study uncovering the possibilities and challenges of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in instruction tuning of large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper studies zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in instruction tuning. What are the key advantages and motivation behind this approach compared to other strategies like translating or collecting instruction data in the target languages? 

2. The paper proposes a careful evaluation methodology with surface metrics, manual inspection, and GPT-3.5 evaluation. What are the limitations of relying only on high-level helpfulness evaluation? What extra insights does the proposed multi-facet evaluation provide?

3. The paper finds that careful hyperparameter tuning, especially learning rate selection, is critical for achieving good cross-lingual transfer. Why does learning rate have such a big impact? What issues arise with suboptimal learning rates?

4. The size of the English instruction tuning dataset has a substantial effect on cross-lingual capabilities. Why does training on the small 1k LIMA dataset lead to much worse transfer compared to the 15k Dolly dataset?  

5. The paper introduces "task modifiers" to study the effect of task complexity. What are some examples of complex instructions that models fail to follow in non-English languages? What makes these instructions difficult?

6. One of the biggest challenges identified is the low factuality of responses in non-English languages. Why do models make more factual errors when following instructions in other languages? How can this issue be addressed?

7. The paper finds occasional fluency errors and logical inconsistencies in non-English responses. What are some examples of such errors? Are there differences across languages?

8. Certain categories of tasks, like language-related tasks and US-centric tasks, seem harder to transfer cross-lingually. Why do models struggle with these specific tasks? 

9. The paper studies both English-centric and multilingually pretrained base models. What differences arise in their cross-lingual capabilities? When is each type of model more suitable?

10. What are some promising future research directions for improving zero-shot cross-lingual instruction tuning, based on the analysis and findings in this work? What are the limitations of current approaches?
