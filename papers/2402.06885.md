# [DimVis: Interpreting Visual Clusters in Dimensionality Reduction With   Explainable Boosting Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like t-SNE and UMAP are popular for transforming high-dimensional data into simpler 2D visual representations. However, these techniques can introduce artifacts and suffer from interpretability issues. Understanding the relationships between the visual clusters in the 2D projections and the original high-dimensional features is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents DimVis, a visualization tool that employs supervised Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) models to enhance the interpretability of DR projections. Key aspects:

- Allows interactive exploration of UMAP projections. Users can adjust hyperparameters and select points of interest.

- An EBM model is trained in real-time on user-selected points against the remaining points. Takes advantage of EBM's inherent interpretability.

- Uses EBM's feature importance scores to rank single and pairwise features that are most relevant to explaining the user selection.

- Visualizes feature relevances through intuitive charts - line plots, histograms, heatmaps. Shows distribution of data and effect of features.

- Model-agnostic and flexible workflow. EBM scales to large datasets with many features.

Main Contributions:

- Novel approach of utilizing supervised EBM models to interpret unsupervised DR techniques.

- Interactive system DimVis that allows users to explore UMAP projections and gain local insights on cluster formations using contrastive EBM models.

- Demonstrated effectiveness on real-world high-dimensional datasets from healthcare domain.

- Discussed flexibility of the approach to incorporate emerging DR and interpretable ML algorithms.

In summary, the paper presents DimVis, an interactive visualization tool powered by EBM models that enhances the interpretability of DR projections by explaining user-selected visual clusters through features.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents DimVis, a visualization tool that uses an Explainable Boosting Machine model to interpret user-selected clusters in UMAP projections by ranking the importance of single and pairwise features that contribute to separating the selected points from the rest of the data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the main contribution is a visualization tool called DimVis that employs a supervised Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model to interpret UMAP projections interactively. Specifically:

- DimVis allows users to select data points of interest in a UMAP projection to form a visual cluster. An EBM model is then trained on this selection to differentiate it from the remaining data points.

- The inherent interpretability of the EBM model is leveraged to provide feature importance rankings and visual explanations for the selected visual cluster. This helps reveal what features contribute to the cluster's formation.

- The tool facilitates interactive exploration of UMAP projections to gain insights into both global patterns and local data relationships. Users can adjust UMAP hyperparameters and analyze different clusters to understand high-dimensional data.

- The usefulness of DimVis for analyzing real-world datasets is demonstrated through a use case and usage scenario focused on healthcare data.

In summary, the key contribution is using a supervised EBM model to enhance the interpretability of UMAP projections through interactive visual analysis. This allows better understanding of complex, high-dimensional data.
