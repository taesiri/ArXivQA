# [Improving Plasticity in Online Continual Learning via Collaborative   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper identifies two key challenges in training online continual learning models: plasticity (the capability to acquire new knowledge) and stability (avoiding catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge). Most prior research has focused almost exclusively on stability through techniques like memory replay, while neglecting the importance of plasticity. However, the authors quantitatively show that both plasticity and stability are crucial for achieving good final performance. There is thus a "plasticity gap" even in state-of-the-art methods that needs to be addressed.

Proposed Solution:
To improve plasticity, the authors propose a Collaborative Continual Learning (CCL) strategy that involves training two peer models simultaneously in a collaborative, peer-teaching manner. CCL allows more parallelism and flexibility during training. Additionally, they propose a Distillation Chain (DC) technique to fully exploit CCL, where the models teach each other through distillation on data samples of varying difficulties, from harder to easier. This acts as a learned regularization that improves generalization.

Main Contributions:
1) Identifying plasticity as an overlooked but critical challenge in online CL and quantitatively showing its impact on final performance.

2) Proposing CCL-DC, the first collaborative learning strategy for online CL, which can flexibly improve plasticity of existing CL methods.

3) Through extensive experiments, showing that CCL-DC substantially boosts performance of state-of-the-art online CL techniques by a large margin (e.g. 53% relative gain). Improvements are consistent across different datasets and memory sizes.

4) Demonstrating other benefits like faster convergence, better feature discrimination and alleviation of shortcut learning.

In summary, the paper provides novel insights into online CL challenges, and introduces an elegant collaborative learning solution that significantly advances the state-of-the-art.
