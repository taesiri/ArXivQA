# [Compact Speech Translation Models via Discrete Speech Units Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Using self-supervised learning (SSL) models like wav2vec2 and HuBERT for speech translation (ST) gives state-of-the-art results, but they have a large memory footprint which hinders on-device deployment. 
- Knowledge distillation to create smaller models requires expensive high-quality pseudo labels for training.
- Using discrete speech units (DSUs) extracted from SSL models is cheaper and are intermediate representations between speech and text, but using them as inputs has downsides: requires slow SSL+clustering inference pipeline, sensitive to tokenization.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage SSL models by pretraining smaller models on DSUs instead of using DSUs as inputs.
- Pretrain encoder-decoder models on: 
  1) Filterbank-to-DSU (Fbk-to-DSU) 
  2) DSU-to-Translation (DSU-to-Trl)
- Take encoder from 1) and decoder from 2) to initialize a new compact model.
- Finetune this model on limited speech-translation data.

Benefits:
- Compact model with no need for SSL model at inference time
- Avoids issues with using DSUs as inputs
- Works for low-resource languages without transcripts

Key Contributions:  
- Method to distill SSL models into compact ST models via DSU pretraining
- Avoid lengthy pipeline needed when using DSUs as inputs
- Analysis showing method is robust to DSU tokenization unlike using DSUs as inputs
- Experiments on CoVoST-2 showing gains over finetuning SSL model directly and on par with ASR pretraining
- Analysis on using CTC in pretraining and finetuning to mitigate modality gap

In summary, the paper proposes a way to effectively transfer knowledge from large SSL speech models into compact and performant speech translation models via pretraining on discrete speech units, demonstrating advantages over alternative transfer learning approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to distill the knowledge from large self-supervised speech models into more compact speech translation models via pretraining on discrete speech units extracted from the self-supervised models, demonstrating improved performance and robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper proposes a method to distill knowledge from large self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models into more compact speech translation models via pretraining on the SSL models' discrete speech units (DSUs). This allows transferring knowledge from bulky SSL models while keeping the final speech translation model compact for on-device deployment.

2) The proposed method avoids the lengthy inference pipeline required when using DSUs as direct inputs to the model. It also makes the model more robust to different DSU tokenizations. 

3) The method does not require transcripts for pretraining, making it suitable for low-resource settings where transcripts may not be available.

4) Experiments on CoVoST-2 for 21 English translation directions demonstrate the proposed compact model (DSU-Adapter) outperforms directly finetuning the HuBERT SSL model by >0.5 BLEU with only half the parameters. It is also on par with an AST model pretrained on transcripts via CTC.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel way to transfer knowledge from large SSL models into compact speech translation models via DSU pretraining, with empirical demonstrations of its effectiveness. The method specifically targets creating small on-device ST models without needing transcripts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Speech translation (ST)
- Discrete speech units (DSU)
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) models (e.g. wav2vec2, HuBERT)
- Knowledge distillation 
- Filterbank-to-DSU (Fbk-to-DSU) 
- DSU-to-Translation (DSU-to-Trl)
- Compact models
- On-device deployment
- Low-resource settings
- Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)
- Cross-lingual ability
- Robustness to tokenization
- Pretraining modality gap

The main goal of the paper is to leverage DSU extracted from SSL models to distill knowledge and create more compact models for on-device speech translation, without needing transcripts. The key ideas involve pretraining separate encoder-decoder models on filterbank-DSU and DSU-translation data, combining them into a single compact model, and finetuning on speech-translation data. Comparisons are made to baselines in terms of model size, tokenization robustness, and translation quality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes pretraining smaller speech translation models on the discrete speech units (DSUs) extracted from self-supervised learning models. What are the key benefits of this approach over using DSUs directly as inputs to the speech translation model?

2. The paper examines the effect of byte pair encoding (BPE) applied to the DSUs. Why does applying BPE to DSUs help the DSU-Adapter method but hurt the DSU-to-Translation method? What does this suggest about the robustness of the proposed approach?

3. The paper ablates different components of their method by examining variants like Enc-Init and EncDec-Init. What do the results suggest about which part of the pretrained models, the encoder or decoder, is more important for transfer to the speech translation task?

4. Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss is explored in pretraining and finetuning. Why might adding CTC loss help mitigate the pretraining modality gap? Does CTC help more in pretraining or finetuning?

5. What are some potential ways the clustering process for generating DSUs could be improved, and how might that impact the performance of the proposed method? 

6. The paper uses a fixed configuration for the HuBERT model that generates DSUs. How could experimenting with different SSL models or different layers change the informativeness of the DSUs?

7. The method does not use additional unlabeled speech data during pretraining. What potential benefits could leveraging unlabeled data have? What are the tradeoffs?

8. How does the performance of the method vary across high, mid, and low resource language pairs? What does this suggest about the applicability to low-resource speech translation?

9. The paper examines the proposed method on a single benchmark. What other datasets could be used to analyze the effectiveness of this approach? Are there potential domain mismatch issues?

10. The inference pipeline for the proposed method is more efficient since DSUs are not needed at test time. Could this approach be deployed on-device for low-latency speech translation? What implementation challenges might exist?
