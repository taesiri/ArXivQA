# [Intelligent Director: An Automatic Framework for Dynamic Visual   Composition using ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ordinary users lack professional skills for high-quality video creation using software like Adobe Premiere. There is growing demand for intelligent, user-friendly video creation tools.
- The paper introduces the challenging task of "Dynamic Visual Composition (DVC)" which integrates text, images, videos and audio based on user instructions to create storytelling videos.

Proposed Solution - "Intelligent Director" Framework:  
- Automatically creates videos from images, videos and captions based on user requirements.
- Key steps:
   1) Caption Generation: Uses LENS to describe images/video keyframes, and ChatGPT to create coherent, storytelling captions and recommend music. 
   2) Music Retrieval: Searches music library for best match using ChatGPT's recommendation.
   3) Video Composition: Captions fused into images/videos; Materials resized for uniformity; Random transitions between materials; Aligns material switches to music beats.
   4) Style Transfer: AnimeGANv2 transfers video into animation styles.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the novel and challenging DVC task of storytelling video creation based on user requirements and multi-modal input.
- Proposes the end-to-end "Intelligent Director" framework to automatically address DVC using state-of-the-art AI models like ChatGPT and AnimeGANv2.
- Constructs two new datasets UCF101-DVC and Personal Album for evaluating DVC solutions.
- Demonstrates qualitatively and quantitatively through metrics and user studies that the proposed framework effectively solves DVC over baselines.

In summary, the paper introduces a new AI-based video editing task, and develops an automated framework leveraging LLMs like ChatGPT to create coherent storytelling videos from images and user input. Both qualitative results and user feedback confirm the approach's effectiveness.
