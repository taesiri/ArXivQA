# [What Generative Artificial Intelligence Means for Terminological   Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Creating terminological definitions is very time-consuming, especially flexible definitions that account for contextual variability in meaning. This poses barriers to keeping definitions up-to-date and meeting user needs.  

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage generative AI tools like ChatGPT to assist terminologists in writing definitions faster. This is termed "AI-assisted terminography".

- A key approach proposed is "post-editing terminography" where the AI produces a draft definition which the terminologist then refines. Optimized prompts can improve the draft quality.

- Other forms of assistance include: resolving domain knowledge doubts, analyzing existing definitions, extracting semantics from corpora, evaluating and refining definitions.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of the advantages (interactivity, customizability) and disadvantages (inaccuracy, bias) of ChatGPT definitions compared to traditional terminological resources.

- Identification of definitions less likely to be replaced by AI, like those with a prescriptive function or found in publications to aid reader comprehension.

- Proposal of various techniques for AI-assisted terminography to increase efficiency of human terminologists.

- Prediction that integration of AI will become inevitable for terminologists to remain competitive against AI tools. Distinction between human-created and AI-content will blur.

In summary, the paper examines the impact of AI on terminological definitions and proposes leveraging AI assistance to empower human terminologists to create better definitions more efficiently.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examines how generative AI tools like ChatGPT are transforming the creation and consumption of terminological definitions, presenting both benefits like interactivity and customizability as well as challenges like inaccuracy, while established terminological resources will likely survive due to their reliability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is to examine the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT on the creation and consumption of terminological definitions. Specifically:

- It compares the advantages and drawbacks of ChatGPT vs traditional terminological resources for providing definitions to users. ChatGPT excels at interactivity and customizability but faces accuracy issues. Some traditional terminological definitions will likely survive due to their reliability.  

- It argues that the distinctions between human-created vs AI-generated terminological content will become increasingly blurred.

- It proposes the notion of "AI-assisted terminography", especially "post-editing terminography", where AI tools like ChatGPT generate draft definitions that human terminologists then refine. This can greatly improve efficiency and quality.

- It provides numerous examples of how ChatGPT can support terminologists in activities like analyzing existing definitions, exploiting corpora, and refining draft definitions.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting an in-depth analysis of the transformative impact of AI like ChatGPT on terminological definition creation and consumption, while also providing practical guidance on leveraging such tools.
