# [What Generative Artificial Intelligence Means for Terminological   Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Creating terminological definitions is very time-consuming, especially flexible definitions that account for contextual variability in meaning. This poses barriers to keeping definitions up-to-date and meeting user needs.  

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage generative AI tools like ChatGPT to assist terminologists in writing definitions faster. This is termed "AI-assisted terminography".

- A key approach proposed is "post-editing terminography" where the AI produces a draft definition which the terminologist then refines. Optimized prompts can improve the draft quality.

- Other forms of assistance include: resolving domain knowledge doubts, analyzing existing definitions, extracting semantics from corpora, evaluating and refining definitions.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of the advantages (interactivity, customizability) and disadvantages (inaccuracy, bias) of ChatGPT definitions compared to traditional terminological resources.

- Identification of definitions less likely to be replaced by AI, like those with a prescriptive function or found in publications to aid reader comprehension.

- Proposal of various techniques for AI-assisted terminography to increase efficiency of human terminologists.

- Prediction that integration of AI will become inevitable for terminologists to remain competitive against AI tools. Distinction between human-created and AI-content will blur.

In summary, the paper examines the impact of AI on terminological definitions and proposes leveraging AI assistance to empower human terminologists to create better definitions more efficiently.
