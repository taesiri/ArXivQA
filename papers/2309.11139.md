# [More complex encoder is not all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11139)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Whether focusing on improving the decoder design and incorporating additional information into U-Net architecture can lead to better medical image segmentation performance compared to only making the encoder more complex. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The decoder plays an equally important role as the encoder in the U-Net architecture for medical image segmentation, but has been relatively overlooked in many recent U-Net variants that focus solely on designing more complex encoders. 2) Plain/simple encoders with convolutional layers may already have sufficient feature extraction capabilities for many medical segmentation tasks with limited data. Making encoders overly complex does not necessarily improve segmentation performance and may lead to overfitting.3) Additional information provided to the network, e.g. via multi-scale wavelet inputs, can compensate for information loss during encoding and improve segmentation.4) Improving the decoder upsampling method with sub-pixel convolution can better restore spatial resolution and feature map details compared to commonly used transpose convolution.The authors designed the neU-Net architecture to test these hypotheses, focusing on decoder enhancement and additional information supplementation rather than designing a more complex encoder. Their experiments on medical image datasets suggest that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results, supporting their hypotheses.
