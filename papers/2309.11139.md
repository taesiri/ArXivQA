# [More complex encoder is not all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11139)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Whether focusing on improving the decoder design and incorporating additional information into U-Net architecture can lead to better medical image segmentation performance compared to only making the encoder more complex. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The decoder plays an equally important role as the encoder in the U-Net architecture for medical image segmentation, but has been relatively overlooked in many recent U-Net variants that focus solely on designing more complex encoders. 2) Plain/simple encoders with convolutional layers may already have sufficient feature extraction capabilities for many medical segmentation tasks with limited data. Making encoders overly complex does not necessarily improve segmentation performance and may lead to overfitting.3) Additional information provided to the network, e.g. via multi-scale wavelet inputs, can compensate for information loss during encoding and improve segmentation.4) Improving the decoder upsampling method with sub-pixel convolution can better restore spatial resolution and feature map details compared to commonly used transpose convolution.The authors designed the neU-Net architecture to test these hypotheses, focusing on decoder enhancement and additional information supplementation rather than designing a more complex encoder. Their experiments on medical image datasets suggest that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results, supporting their hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies an imbalance in the evolution of commonly used encoder-decoder networks for medical image segmentation. While encoders have become increasingly complex, decoders are often overlooked. 2. It proposes two main strategies to improve segmentation performance:- Introducing additional information: The paper uses multi-scale wavelet decomposition on the input images to provide additional information to the encoder. This helps compensate for information loss during downsampling.- Building a more powerful decoder: The paper focuses on improving the upsampling component in the decoder by proposing a sub-pixel convolution method. This enhances the quality of upsampling compared to commonly used transpose convolution. 3. It introduces neU-Net, which incorporates the above two ideas - multi-scale wavelet inputs and sub-pixel convolution upsampling. Experiments on Synapse and ACDC datasets show neU-Net achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance.4. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the proposed multi-scale wavelet inputs and sub-pixel convolution modules in improving segmentation accuracy over the baseline nnU-Net model.In summary, the key novelty of this paper is shifting focus beyond just the encoder to building more robust decoders, and using additional information to compensate for lost information during encoding, for medical image segmentation. The proposed neU-Net architecture exemplifies these concepts and achieves excellent results.
