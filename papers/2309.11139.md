# [More complex encoder is not all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11139)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Whether focusing on improving the decoder design and incorporating additional information into U-Net architecture can lead to better medical image segmentation performance compared to only making the encoder more complex. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The decoder plays an equally important role as the encoder in the U-Net architecture for medical image segmentation, but has been relatively overlooked in many recent U-Net variants that focus solely on designing more complex encoders. 2) Plain/simple encoders with convolutional layers may already have sufficient feature extraction capabilities for many medical segmentation tasks with limited data. Making encoders overly complex does not necessarily improve segmentation performance and may lead to overfitting.3) Additional information provided to the network, e.g. via multi-scale wavelet inputs, can compensate for information loss during encoding and improve segmentation.4) Improving the decoder upsampling method with sub-pixel convolution can better restore spatial resolution and feature map details compared to commonly used transpose convolution.The authors designed the neU-Net architecture to test these hypotheses, focusing on decoder enhancement and additional information supplementation rather than designing a more complex encoder. Their experiments on medical image datasets suggest that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results, supporting their hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies an imbalance in the evolution of commonly used encoder-decoder networks for medical image segmentation. While encoders have become increasingly complex, decoders are often overlooked. 2. It proposes two main strategies to improve segmentation performance:- Introducing additional information: The paper uses multi-scale wavelet decomposition on the input images to provide additional information to the encoder. This helps compensate for information loss during downsampling.- Building a more powerful decoder: The paper focuses on improving the upsampling component in the decoder by proposing a sub-pixel convolution method. This enhances the quality of upsampling compared to commonly used transpose convolution. 3. It introduces neU-Net, which incorporates the above two ideas - multi-scale wavelet inputs and sub-pixel convolution upsampling. Experiments on Synapse and ACDC datasets show neU-Net achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance.4. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the proposed multi-scale wavelet inputs and sub-pixel convolution modules in improving segmentation accuracy over the baseline nnU-Net model.In summary, the key novelty of this paper is shifting focus beyond just the encoder to building more robust decoders, and using additional information to compensate for lost information during encoding, for medical image segmentation. The proposed neU-Net architecture exemplifies these concepts and achieves excellent results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new 3D medical image segmentation model called neU-Net that improves segmentation performance by using multi-scale wavelet inputs to provide additional information and a sub-pixel convolution upsampling method to build a more powerful decoder, avoiding the need for a more complex encoder.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of medical image segmentation:- The key focus of this paper is on improving the decoder part of U-Net and its variants, rather than just enhancing the encoder like many other works. The authors argue that most current research concentrates too much on designing complex encoders, while overlooking the importance of the decoder.- The paper introduces two main novelties - using multi-scale wavelet inputs to provide additional information to the encoder, and replacing transposed convolution with sub-pixel convolution in the decoder for better upsampling. - Providing additional information through multi-scale inputs has been explored before in other works, like UNet++ and UNet3+. However, this paper uses wavelet decomposition rather than simple downsampling to retain more information at each scale.- Many recent segmentation models use attention mechanisms or Transformers, like UNETR, Swin UNet, and MissFormer. This paper instead focuses on optimizing the basic U-Net architecture with CNNs, showing strong results can be achieved without very complex encoders.- For the decoder, techniques like Attention U-Net have focused on using attention to select relevant encoder features. This paper specifically targets improving the upsampling operation itself with sub-pixel convolution.- The methods are evaluated on multi-organ and cardiac MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to Transformers and other recent approaches. This demonstrates the importance of decoder design.Overall, a key differentiation of this work is the balanced focus on improving both the encoder and decoder parts of U-Net, through intuitive techniques to supplement information and enhance upsampling quality. The results validate the potential of this approach as an alternative to designing very complex encoder-only models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further development of the decoder architecture and upsampling methods. The authors argue that the decoder plays a crucial role in segmentation quality but is often overlooked. They suggest exploring novel decoder designs and upsampling techniques beyond transposed convolution.- Additional ways to incorporate more information into the network. The authors show adding multi-scale wavelet inputs helps performance, so they suggest exploring other methods to provide networks with richer information, like attention or using different image transformations.- Evaluation on more diverse datasets. The authors demonstrate results on only a couple medical imaging datasets. They suggest testing neU-Net on more varied data across modalities, organs, pathologies, etc. to further validate its effectiveness.- Combining ideas like neU-Net with transformer architectures. The authors build neU-Net based on a standard convolutional encoder-decoder but suggest hybrid approaches combining their ideas with recent transformer-based networks could be promising.- Continued focus on optimizing clinically important small structures. The ablation studies show their methods particularly improve segmentation of smaller structures. The authors suggest further work to tailor approaches toward accurately segmenting small lesions, tumours, etc.- Development of neU-Net for other tasks beyond segmentation. The authors present neU-Net for segmentation but suggest their ideas could extend beneficially to other medical imaging tasks like classification, detection, registration, etc.In summary, the authors argue for more work on powerful decoder designs and information integration rather than just complex encoders, and suggest numerous avenues to further explore and validate these concepts across medical imaging applications.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new deep learning model called neU-Net for medical image segmentation. The authors argue that most recent improvements to U-Net have focused on building more complex encoders, while overlooking the importance of the decoder. The decoder has two key functions - upsampling feature maps to restore resolution, and refining segmentation based on encoder outputs. Thus a powerful decoder is crucial for good segmentation. However, commonly used upsampling methods like transposed convolution can cause artifacts in 3D segmentation. To address this, neU-Net introduces two main improvements - providing additional input information using multi-scale wavelet decomposition, and building a better decoder with sub-pixel convolution upsampling. The wavelet input provides multi-scale frequency information to compensate for downsampling losses. Sub-pixel convolution progressively upsamples through pixel shuffling, avoiding checkerboard artifacts. Experiments on multi-organ CT and cardiac MRI datasets show state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the benefits of focusing on decoder design and extra input information rather than just encoder complexity. Key innovations are the sub-pixel upsampling and wavelet multi-scale inputs for medical segmentation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new network architecture called neU-Net (not complex encoder U-Net) for medical image segmentation. The key ideas are 1) introducing additional information through multi-scale wavelet inputs to compensate for information loss during downsampling in the encoder, and 2) building a more powerful decoder using a novel sub-pixel convolution method for upsampling instead of commonly used transposed convolution. Specifically, the input image undergoes 3D discrete wavelet transform to generate multi-scale wavelet coefficients that are provided as additional inputs to each encoder layer. This captures information at multiple resolutions. The decoder uses sub-pixel convolution for upsampling by expanding the channel dimension through convolutions followed by pixel shuffle to rearrange pixels and increase spatial resolution. This avoids checkerboard artifacts of transposed convolution. Overall, the method focuses on improving the decoder and supplementing information rather than designing complex encoders. Experiments on multi-organ segmentation datasets Synapse and BTCV demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
