# [SGNet: Structure Guided Network via Gradient-Frequency Awareness for   Depth Map Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Depth super-resolution (DSR) aims to restore a high-resolution (HR) depth map from a low-resolution (LR) one, with the guidance of an HR RGB image. However, existing DSR methods mainly focus on the spatial domain, which is insufficient to recover clear high-frequency depth structures that are degraded in LR depth maps.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Structure Guided Network (SGNet) that pays attention to both gradient and frequency domains to exploit their inherent strengths for structure representation. SGNet consists of two key components:

1) Gradient Calibration Module (GCM): Maps RGB and LR depth into gradient domain and uses the accurate RGB gradients as prior to calibrate and sharpen the blurred LR depth gradients. A gradient loss is introduced to further enhance the structure.  

2) Frequency Awareness Module (FAM): Recursively propagates the precise high-frequency spectrum components from RGB to LR depth via multiple Spectrum Differencing Blocks (SDB). A frequency loss is designed to strengthen the frequency response.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a novel perspective of utilizing gradient and frequency domains to enhance depth structure in DSR instead of only the spatial domain.
- Proposes SGNet that recovers depth structure by leveraging both gradient prior and high-frequency propagation.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets (reducing error by up to 16-24%) with efficient and lightweight modules.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions by exploiting gradient and frequency domains to guide the depth structure recovery for depth super-resolution. The proposed SGNet with gradient calibration and frequency awareness achieves top performance.
