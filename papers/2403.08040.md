# [MicroT: Low-Energy and Adaptive Models for MCUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08040)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs) for multiple localized tasks is challenging. MCUs have limited communication, privacy concerns, and lack task-specific data. Cloud-trained models may not work well for diverse local tasks. Existing methods like federated learning, split learning, and multitask learning have limitations in addressing the multi-task challenge on MCUs. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes MicroT, a low-energy and adaptive model framework for MCUs to efficiently process multiple tasks. MicroT has the following key components:

1) Powerful and Tiny Feature Extractor: A student model is trained using self-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) to learn general features from a teacher model. This allows simple classifiers to achieve good performance on multiple tasks.

2) Low-Energy Local Training: On the MCU, only a basic classifier needs to be trained using the extracted features, enabling low-energy training.

3) Model Segmentation and Joint Training: The feature extractor is split into a part model and full model and jointly optimized to improve part model independence while retaining overall performance.

4) Stage-Decision Inference: Samples are first classified by the part model, then full model if confidence is low, reducing energy costs. The stage-decision ratio is configurable.

Main Contributions:

- SSKD effectively improves model accuracy by up to 9.87\% over baseline for multiple tasks
- Model segmentation and joint training optimize part/full model performance  
- MicroT enables low-energy local training, with as low as 2.60mJ energy consumption
- Stage-decision reduces energy costs by up to 29.13\% compared to full model inference
- Standard stage-decision ratio of 0.5 improves accuracy by 5.91\% and saves 14.47% energy

In summary, MicroT is an adaptive and practical solution for low-energy, high-performance multi-task learning on resource-constrained MCUs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

MicroT is a low-energy and adaptive model framework designed for resource-constrained microcontroller units to efficiently process multiple on-device machine learning tasks through strategies including self-supervised knowledge distillation, model segmentation, joint training, and configurable stage-decision inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MicroT, a practical, low-energy, and open-source framework to address the multi-task challenge of microcontroller units (MCUs). Specifically:

1) MicroT leverages a powerful yet compact feature extractor obtained through self-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD), allowing it to achieve good performance across multiple tasks while being small enough to run efficiently on MCUs. 

2) MicroT employs strategies like model segmentation, joint training, and stage-decision (joint inference) to further reduce energy consumption during inference on MCUs. This includes having a part model preprocess samples first before selectively passing low-confidence ones to the full model.

3) MicroT allows for dynamic adjustment of parameters like stage-decision ratio and threshold to balance model performance and energy usage. It provides adaptability for use-cases with different requirements.

4) Evaluations show MicroT can improve model accuracy by up to 9.87\% and reduce energy consumption by up to 29.13% compared to baseline, with around 5.91% better accuracy and 14.47% energy savings using standard configurations.

In summary, the key innovation is an adaptive MCU multi-task framework enabling energy-efficient inference while still maintaining good performance across multiple tasks. The experiments demonstrate MicroT's practicality and energy savings in addressing this challenging problem.
