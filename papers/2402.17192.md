# [Differentiable Biomechanics Unlocks Opportunities for Markerless Motion   Capture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing approaches for markerless motion capture (MMC) using computer vision are limited by the lack of differentiable biomechanical models that can be integrated into machine learning pipelines. 
- Scaling biomechanical models to an individual's measurements and fitting inverse kinematics is difficult with current differentiable physics simulators.
- Marker locations on biomechanical models need to be optimized for different human pose estimation algorithms, which have different idiosyncrasies.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable biomechanical model in Mujoco to enable end-to-end bilevel optimization.
- Represent the pose trajectory over time with an implicit function that maps time to pose parameters.
- Propagate this through the forward kinematic model to minimize reprojection error of virtual markers.
- Implement model scaling and marker offsets that can be optimized in the GPU.
- Perform trilevel optimization to meta-optimize the base model's marker locations on a dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Enabled personalized model scaling and inverse kinematic fitting with bilevel optimization using a fully differentiable biomechanical model.
- Implemented end-to-end differentiable bilevel optimization that minimizes reprojection error.
- Performed bundle adjustment during this optimization to refine extrinsic camera parameters.  
- Implemented trilevel optimization to meta-optimize the base biomechanical model's marker locations over multiple subjects.
- Showed improved reprojection error and accurate spatial gait parameters compared to prior methods and an instrumented walkway.

In summary, they proposed a fully differentiable biomechanics pipeline using implicit representations and GPU-accelerated simulation that enables more accurate and consistent markerless motion capture. The end-to-end approach and trilevel optimization in particular are key innovations highlighted.
