# [When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning? It Depends on the   Discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. 
- It examines the practical utility of two advanced planning methods - iterative correction and tree search - compared to a simpler method called re-ranking.  
- The key research questions are: (RQ1) How does discrimination accuracy affect overall agent performance with different planning methods? (RQ2) Can LLM-based discriminators correctly assess agents' action sequences?

Methods
- Evaluated on text-to-SQL parsing and math reasoning tasks using a generator-discriminator framework.
- Generator proposes action sequences, discriminator evaluates outcomes, planning method manages their interaction.
- Compared three planning methods: re-ranking, iterative correction, tree search. 
- Tested with open-source LLMs, closed-source LLMs, and fine-tuned LLMs as discriminators.
- Improved discrimination with executability checking and execution results.

Key Findings
- Discrimination accuracy strongly correlates with agent performance regardless of planning method.  
- Advanced methods demand highly accurate discriminators (â‰¥90% accuracy) to improve over re-ranking.
- Enhanced LLMs' discrimination up to 30.2 and 8.4 absolute points but still fall short of advanced methods' needs.   
- With LLM discriminators, advanced methods show negligible gains over re-ranking but are 10-20x slower.

Main Contributions
- Showed importance of discrimination accuracy for overall agent performance.
- Demonstrated limitations of current LLM discriminators.
- Highlighted issues with using advanced planning methods in practice.
- Provided insights into designing more capable language agents.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed solution, methods, findings, and contributions from the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how the discrimination accuracy of language models affects the performance of different planning methods like re-ranking, iterative correction, and tree search in multi-step language agent tasks like text-to-SQL parsing and math reasoning, finding that advanced planning methods require highly accurate discriminators while current LLMs struggle to meet this need.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper presents a thorough investigation into the relationship between discrimination accuracy and performance of planning methods in language agents. Through comprehensive experiments on text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, the key findings are:

(1) Discrimination accuracy strongly correlates with the overall performance of language agents using different planning methods and also affects their efficiency. 

(2) LLM-based discriminators can correctly assess a decent number of language agents' actions with their environmental observations, but they are still not accurate enough for advanced planning methods.

(3) Advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency when using LLM-based discriminators. For example, compared to other methods, tree search is much slower but leads to negligible performance gains.

In summary, the paper focuses on studying discriminators and planning methods in language agents, and attempts to improve LLMs' discrimination capability. The findings provide useful guidelines for choosing planning methods and implementing language agents in practice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Language agents
- Generator-discriminator framework
- Planning methods (re-ranking, iterative correction, tree search) 
- Discrimination accuracy
- Large language models (LLMs)

The paper investigates different planning methods like re-ranking, iterative correction, and tree search in a generator-discriminator framework for language agents. It examines how the discrimination accuracy of the discriminator affects the overall performance of agents using these different planning methods. The tasks focused on are text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning. So the key concepts cover the different components of the language agents, the planning methods compared, the tasks tested on, and the role of discrimination accuracy which is the main aspect analyzed in the paper.
