# [When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning? It Depends on the   Discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. 
- It examines the practical utility of two advanced planning methods - iterative correction and tree search - compared to a simpler method called re-ranking.  
- The key research questions are: (RQ1) How does discrimination accuracy affect overall agent performance with different planning methods? (RQ2) Can LLM-based discriminators correctly assess agents' action sequences?

Methods
- Evaluated on text-to-SQL parsing and math reasoning tasks using a generator-discriminator framework.
- Generator proposes action sequences, discriminator evaluates outcomes, planning method manages their interaction.
- Compared three planning methods: re-ranking, iterative correction, tree search. 
- Tested with open-source LLMs, closed-source LLMs, and fine-tuned LLMs as discriminators.
- Improved discrimination with executability checking and execution results.

Key Findings
- Discrimination accuracy strongly correlates with agent performance regardless of planning method.  
- Advanced methods demand highly accurate discriminators (â‰¥90% accuracy) to improve over re-ranking.
- Enhanced LLMs' discrimination up to 30.2 and 8.4 absolute points but still fall short of advanced methods' needs.   
- With LLM discriminators, advanced methods show negligible gains over re-ranking but are 10-20x slower.

Main Contributions
- Showed importance of discrimination accuracy for overall agent performance.
- Demonstrated limitations of current LLM discriminators.
- Highlighted issues with using advanced planning methods in practice.
- Provided insights into designing more capable language agents.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed solution, methods, findings, and contributions from the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
