# [Deep Automated Mechanism Design for Integrating Ad Auction and   Allocation in Feed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- E-commerce platforms display a feed mixed with organic items and ads. The ad auction and allocation processes directly impact platform revenue and GMV. 
- The prevalent method of separating these into two stages has issues:
    1) Auctions like GSP don't consider ad externalities (position and context influence on CTR).
    2) Allocation strategies dynamically determine ad position based on payment, but this lacks incentive compatibility for ads.

Proposed Solution:
- A deep automated mechanism called MIAA that integrates ad auction and allocation. It considers externalities and is incentive compatible while maximizing revenue and GMV.

- Three main modules:
    1) Externality-aware Prediction Module (EPM): Predicts CTR and GMV for each candidate allocation using a list-wise model.
    2) Automated Auction Module (AAM): Selects optimal allocation using parameterized social welfare function based on automated mechanism design. Guarantees incentive compatibility.
    3) Differentiable Sorting Module (DSM): Relaxes discrete sorting into continuous space and calculates expected performance metrics for end-to-end learning.
    
- Trained end-to-end to maximize a weighted combination of expected revenue and GMV.

Main Contributions:
- First mechanism to jointly optimize ad auction and allocation while considering externalities and incentive compatibility.
- Significantly outperforms previous separated mechanisms on both public and industrial datasets.
- Deployed at Meituan, improves revenue, GMV, RPM and GPM over baselines.

In summary, this paper proposes an end-to-end learned, automated mechanism that integrates ad auction and allocation. By considering externalities and incentive compatibility, it improves e-commerce platform performance over conventional separated mechanisms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a deep automated mechanism that integrates ad auction and allocation to simultaneously determine the ranking, payment, and display position of ads while maximizing revenue and gross merchandise volume.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a deep automated mechanism, MIAA, for integrating ad auction and allocation in feed. This mechanism simultaneously decides the ranking, payment, and display position of the ad while satisfying incentive compatibility (IC) and individual rationality (IR) in the presence of externalities. 

2) Providing detailed industrial and practical experience. The authors successfully deploy MIAA on the Meituan retail feed and obtain significant improvements in both platform revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV) compared to state-of-the-art baselines in offline experiments and online A/B tests.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing a novel automated mechanism that jointly optimizes ad auction and allocation to maximize revenue and GMV, with demonstrated effectiveness in industry applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel deep automated mechanism MIAA for integrating ad auction and allocation. What are the key motivations and challenges for designing such an integrated mechanism instead of handling auction and allocation separately?

2. Externality-aware Prediction Module (EPM) is used in MIAA to model the impact of global externalities. How does EPM capture the interactions between ads, organic items, positions, contexts etc? What prediction targets can be modeled beyond CTR?

3. The paper extends Automated Mechanism Design into deep neural networks for improving expressive ability. How are μ-network and λ-network designed? What auction properties do they guarantee? 

4. Differentiable Sorting Module (DSM) aims to tackle the non-differentiability of ranking process and lack of user feedback. How does it achieve continuous relaxation of sorting? What performance metrics are used for model training?

5. What are the key differences between the proposed MIAA mechanism and baseline methods like GSP+Fixed Position, GSP+Cross DQN, Score-Weighted VCG, IAS etc? How does MIAA outperform them?

6. The paper claims MIAA satisfies incentive compatibility (IC) and individual rationality (IR) in presence of externalities. Can you explain mathematically how these properties are ensured in the proposed framework?

7. What practical benefits and business values does the proposed MIAA mechanism provide for e-commerce platforms? What improvements are observed during offline experiments and online A/B tests?

8. What are the limitations of current work? How can the method be extended, such as handling multiple ad slots auction and allocation in feeds?

9. The current method relies on CTR/GMV prediction for model training and evaluation. How reliable and stable is it? What potential risks exist and how to mitigate them?

10. Automated Mechanism Design is an emerging field. What are the open challenges and future directions for designing optimized and intelligent mechanisms for computational advertising?
