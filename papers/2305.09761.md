# [NerfBridge: Bringing Real-time, Online Neural Radiance Field Training to   Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to enable real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from image streams for robotics applications. The paper proposes NerfBridge, a software package to bridge the gap between the NeRF training library Nerfstudio and the Robot Operating System (ROS). This allows streaming images and poses from a robot platform to be used to train a NeRF in real-time. The key hypothesis seems to be that by providing this real-time NeRF training capability through NerfBridge, it will enable and accelerate research and development of NeRF-based applications in robotics. Things like mapping, localization, and planning could potentially benefit from online-trained NeRF scene representations.So in summary, the main research contribution is NerfBridge itself, which aims to facilitate real-time, online NeRF training from robot sensor streams to enable new NeRF-based capabilities in robotics. The paper demonstrates this through an example mapping application with a camera-equipped quadrotor.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting NerfBridge, an open-source software package that bridges the gap between the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Nerfstudio for real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from a stream of images. Specifically, NerfBridge enables integrating streaming images and poses from a robotics platform with efficient NeRF training pipelines provided by Nerfstudio. This allows for rapid development of research on applications of NeRFs in robotics, such as using NeRFs for mapping or navigation. The paper demonstrates an example application using NerfBridge to train a NeRF in real-time from images captured by a camera on a quadrotor drone.In summary, the key contribution is providing the NerfBridge software to facilitate online, real-time NeRF training and research at the intersection of robotics and neural scene representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper on NerfBridge compares to other related research on real-time NeRF training and mapping:- This paper focuses specifically on bridging the gap between efficient NeRF training libraries like Nerfstudio and robotics middleware like ROS. Other papers have explored real-time NeRF mapping, but don't provide easy-to-use open source tools for integration.- The modular design of NerfBridge allows flexibility in choosing different NeRF architectures and pose estimation methods. Other real-time NeRF mapping papers typically propose one end-to-end method with less flexibility.- By building on top of Nerfstudio, this work benefits from state-of-the-art optimizations for fast NeRF training. Some other real-time NeRF mapping papers use less efficient training procedures. - The hardware setup and mapping experiments demonstrate how NerfBridge can be used for online mapping on a quadrotor platform. This provides a more practical robotics use case compared to some other papers that focus solely on algorithms.- NerfBridge is designed to be simple and extensible, rather than aiming to propose novel NeRF training techniques. Other papers put more emphasis on new methodological contributions for real-time training.- Overall, the focus on integration and bridging the gap between robotics and NeRFs sets this work apart from others that focus more narrowly on just algorithms or just applications. The open source release of NerfBridge is a useful contribution for this emerging research area.In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution by providing an adaptable open source tool for real-time NeRF mapping in robotics, complementing other research that focuses more heavily on novel methods or applications. The integration focus is this work's unique strength.
