# [NerfBridge: Bringing Real-time, Online Neural Radiance Field Training to   Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to enable real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from image streams for robotics applications. The paper proposes NerfBridge, a software package to bridge the gap between the NeRF training library Nerfstudio and the Robot Operating System (ROS). This allows streaming images and poses from a robot platform to be used to train a NeRF in real-time. The key hypothesis seems to be that by providing this real-time NeRF training capability through NerfBridge, it will enable and accelerate research and development of NeRF-based applications in robotics. Things like mapping, localization, and planning could potentially benefit from online-trained NeRF scene representations.So in summary, the main research contribution is NerfBridge itself, which aims to facilitate real-time, online NeRF training from robot sensor streams to enable new NeRF-based capabilities in robotics. The paper demonstrates this through an example mapping application with a camera-equipped quadrotor.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting NerfBridge, an open-source software package that bridges the gap between the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Nerfstudio for real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from a stream of images. Specifically, NerfBridge enables integrating streaming images and poses from a robotics platform with efficient NeRF training pipelines provided by Nerfstudio. This allows for rapid development of research on applications of NeRFs in robotics, such as using NeRFs for mapping or navigation. The paper demonstrates an example application using NerfBridge to train a NeRF in real-time from images captured by a camera on a quadrotor drone.In summary, the key contribution is providing the NerfBridge software to facilitate online, real-time NeRF training and research at the intersection of robotics and neural scene representations.
