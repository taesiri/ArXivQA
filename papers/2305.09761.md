# [NerfBridge: Bringing Real-time, Online Neural Radiance Field Training to   Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to enable real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from image streams for robotics applications. The paper proposes NerfBridge, a software package to bridge the gap between the NeRF training library Nerfstudio and the Robot Operating System (ROS). This allows streaming images and poses from a robot platform to be used to train a NeRF in real-time. The key hypothesis seems to be that by providing this real-time NeRF training capability through NerfBridge, it will enable and accelerate research and development of NeRF-based applications in robotics. Things like mapping, localization, and planning could potentially benefit from online-trained NeRF scene representations.So in summary, the main research contribution is NerfBridge itself, which aims to facilitate real-time, online NeRF training from robot sensor streams to enable new NeRF-based capabilities in robotics. The paper demonstrates this through an example mapping application with a camera-equipped quadrotor.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The paper demonstrates an example application using NerfBridge to train a NeRF in real-time from images captured by a camera on a quadrotor drone.In summary, the key contribution is providing the NerfBridge software to facilitate online, real-time NeRF training and research at the intersection of robotics and neural scene representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper on NerfBridge compares to other related research on real-time NeRF training and mapping:- This paper focuses specifically on bridging the gap between efficient NeRF training libraries like Nerfstudio and robotics middleware like ROS. Other papers have explored real-time NeRF mapping, but don't provide easy-to-use open source tools for integration.- The modular design of NerfBridge allows flexibility in choosing different NeRF architectures and pose estimation methods. Other real-time NeRF mapping papers typically propose one end-to-end method with less flexibility.- By building on top of Nerfstudio, this work benefits from state-of-the-art optimizations for fast NeRF training. Some other real-time NeRF mapping papers use less efficient training procedures. - The hardware setup and mapping experiments demonstrate how NerfBridge can be used for online mapping on a quadrotor platform. This provides a more practical robotics use case compared to some other papers that focus solely on algorithms.- NerfBridge is designed to be simple and extensible, rather than aiming to propose novel NeRF training techniques. Other papers put more emphasis on new methodological contributions for real-time training.- Overall, the focus on integration and bridging the gap between robotics and NeRFs sets this work apart from others that focus more narrowly on just algorithms or just applications. The open source release of NerfBridge is a useful contribution for this emerging research area.In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution by providing an adaptable open source tool for real-time NeRF mapping in robotics, complementing other research that focuses more heavily on novel methods or applications. The integration focus is this work's unique strength.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Combining online NeRF training with NeRF-based navigation algorithms for robot trajectory optimization and mapping. The paper mentions this as an interesting direction for using online-trained NeRFs in robotics applications.- Studying novel keyframing schemes for online NeRF training to avoid catastrophic forgetting. The paper notes that online NeRF training is relatively unexplored and information-based keyframing could help with issues like catastrophic forgetting during incremental training.- Exploring other robotics applications of online-trained NeRFs beyond mapping. The paper presents a mapping case study, but notes the potential for NeRFs to change representation in robotics more broadly. This suggests exploring how online NeRFs could be used in other robotics problems.- Developing online training procedures tailored to robotics constraints. The paper uses a general online NeRF training approach, but training procedures optimized for robotic data collection could improve results.- Investigating techniques to speed up online NeRF training and inference. To enable real-time use, research into acceleration techniques like model compression or efficient inference is important.- Evaluating the effects of different data collection trajectories and modalities. The effects of factors like camera trajectories, lighting changes, sensors modalities etc. on online NeRF training could reveal insights.In summary, the main directions are leveraging online NeRFs for robotics applications, improving online training procedures, and evaluating the effects of different data collection conditions and scenarios. The overarching goal being to enable effective use of NeRFs as a representation in robotics systems.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents NerfBridge, an open-source software package that bridges the gap between the popular NeRF training library Nerfstudio and the Robot Operating System (ROS). NerfBridge enables real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from a stream of images captured by a robot or drone. It creates a ROS node that listens to pose and image topics, continuously inserts new images and poses into arrays, and parallelly trains a NeRF on those images using Nerfstudio. This allows robotic platforms like camera-equipped quadrotors to map environments in real-time and train NeRF reconstructions on the fly. As an example, the authors demonstrate using NerfBridge with a quadrotor mapping an indoor scene of pipes and an outdoor building facade. The quadrotor streams images which are paired with poses from visual odometry, and NerfBridge incrementally trains a NeRF, providing live feedback on the reconstruction quality.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to enable real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from a stream of images captured by a robot or autonomous system. Traditional NeRF training is done offline on a complete, static dataset. But for robotics applications, it would be useful to train a NeRF model incrementally as new image data is captured, without having to retrain from scratch each time. The key contributions seem to be:- Proposing NerfBridge, a software package that bridges the gap between the NeRF training library Nerfstudio and the Robot Operating System (ROS). This allows streaming images and poses from a robot to be fed into Nerfstudio for real-time NeRF training.- Providing a detailed hardware setup using a camera-equipped quadrotor and ground station computer to demonstrate real-time mapping and NeRF training using NerfBridge. They show results for both indoor and outdoor environments.- Releasing NerfBridge as open source to make it easy for others to build on this for robotics research at the intersection of NeRFs and SLAM, exploration, planning, etc.So in summary, the main problem is enabling online, real-time NeRF training from streaming robot sensor data, as opposed to offline training on static datasets. NerfBridge aims to address this by bridging state-of-the-art NeRF libraries with standard robotics middleware.
