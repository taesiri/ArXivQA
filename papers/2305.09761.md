# [NerfBridge: Bringing Real-time, Online Neural Radiance Field Training to   Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to enable real-time, online training of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from image streams for robotics applications. The paper proposes NerfBridge, a software package to bridge the gap between the NeRF training library Nerfstudio and the Robot Operating System (ROS). This allows streaming images and poses from a robot platform to be used to train a NeRF in real-time. The key hypothesis seems to be that by providing this real-time NeRF training capability through NerfBridge, it will enable and accelerate research and development of NeRF-based applications in robotics. Things like mapping, localization, and planning could potentially benefit from online-trained NeRF scene representations.So in summary, the main research contribution is NerfBridge itself, which aims to facilitate real-time, online NeRF training from robot sensor streams to enable new NeRF-based capabilities in robotics. The paper demonstrates this through an example mapping application with a camera-equipped quadrotor.
