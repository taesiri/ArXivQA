# [Language Models Are Greedy Reasoners: A Systematic Formal Analysis of   Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01240)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) when evaluated on a new synthetic question answering dataset designed to facilitate formal analysis of the predicted chains-of-thought?

The key aspects of this research question are:

- Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, specifically their ability to perform logical deduction.

- Using a new synthetic QA dataset called PrOntoQA to enable formal analysis of the predicted reasoning chains, by parsing them into logical forms. 

- Analyzing whether the models are able to apply deduction rules correctly at each step (local reasoning) and plan ahead to complete the full proof (global reasoning).

- Investigating how different variables like ontology type (true/false/fictional), number of reasoning steps, etc. affect the model's reasoning ability.

- Understanding the causes of reasoning errors through fine-grained proof analysis, to identify limitations and improve reasoning ability.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by evaluating LLMs on PrOntoQA and formally analyzing their predicted chains-of-thought, we can gain new insights into their reasoning capabilities and limitations. The goal is to move beyond just predicting the right labels, and actually understand how the models reason on controlled but challenging reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- The introduction of a new synthetic question answering dataset called PrOntoQA for evaluating logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key properties of PrOntoQA are:

1) The examples are generated from symbolic proofs over fictional ontologies. This removes the confounding factor of prior world knowledge. 

2) The examples have simple syntax and grammar, which allows easy parsing into logical forms for formal analysis.

3) The dataset allows control over various properties like ontology type, number of reasoning steps, etc. to systematically analyze an LLM's reasoning abilities.

- Formal analysis of the reasoning chains predicted by InstructGPT and GPT-3 on PrOntoQA. The key findings are:

1) The models are generally capable of producing valid individual reasoning steps, even in fictional contexts.

2) However, they struggle with proof planning - selecting the right sequence of steps to prove the final query. Errors often arise from misleading steps that divert the proof from the gold standard.

3) Real-world knowledge from pretraining helps reasoning, as performance drops on fictional or false ontologies.

4) Reasoning ability declines as proof lengths increase.

Overall, the paper introduces a valuable new resource for analyzing reasoning in LLMs and provides interesting insights into their capabilities and limitations through formal proof analysis. The dataset and framework could be useful for further research on improving reasoning abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new synthetic QA dataset called PrOntoQA for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Other datasets like ProofWriter, FOLIO, and SimpleLogic have also been proposed for testing logical reasoning, but this paper argues PrOntoQA has more control over variables like true vs fictional contexts, unary vs binary predicates, and specific deduction rules. The controllable data generation process seems useful.

- The analysis focuses specifically on evaluating reasoning of LLMs via chain-of-thought prompting. Other work has looked at reasoning in different ways - e.g. directly in natural language, or using neuro-symbolic methods with semantic parsing. But this paper provides a detailed analysis of proof steps predicted by the LLM.

- The finding that LLMs struggle with proof planning/strategizing seems consistent with other evidence that these models are limited in their systematic reasoning abilities, even though they can make valid individual deduction steps.

- The use of a synthetic fictional dataset to avoid memorization confounds is a nice idea, though generalization to real-world reasoning needs to be tested. Using controllable data helps dig deeper into model capabilities.

- The paper mostly focuses on analyzing modus ponens reasoning over fairly simple linguistic constructions. Extending the analysis to more complex proofs and language is noted as interesting future work.

Overall, the work seems to advance understanding of LLM reasoning abilities through detailed analysis facilitated by a new synthetic QA dataset. The controllable data generation and proof step evaluation help systematically probe model capabilities and limitations. More investigation would be needed to relate insights to real-world reasoning tasks. But the approach appears promising for studying reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on more complex proofs that require longer chains of reasoning, use additional deduction rules beyond modus ponens, and contain more semantically complex sentences. The examples in the PrOntoQA dataset were limited to short proofs using only modus ponens over simple sentences.

- Comparing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to human reasoning through behavioral experiments. This could shed light on what aspects of human reasoning LLMs have managed to acquire through pretraining.

- Using the PrOntoQA dataset to further pretrain or fine-tune LLMs to try to improve their reasoning abilities. The synthetic reasoning examples could provide useful training signal.

- Exploring different prompting strategies beyond chain-of-thought that may elicit better reasoning from LLMs, such as the selection-inference approach.

- Incorporating more sophisticated proof search strategies, like depth-first search, instead of just chain-of-thought reasoning. This may help address limitations in proof planning.

- Using neurosymbolic methods to combine neural network reasoning with symbolic reasoning over logical forms. This could potentially overcome some limitations like lack of systematic proof search.

- Analyzing what parts of the pretraining data allow LLMs to acquire reasoning abilities to better understand where this capability comes from.

In summary, the main directions are developing more challenging reasoning tasks, comparing to human performance, using the synthetic data to improve LLMs, trying new prompting strategies, incorporating symbolic methods, and analyzing the pretraining process.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces PrOntoQA, a new synthetic question answering dataset for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). PrOntoQA contains examples generated from logical proofs over fictional ontologies, allowing the model's reasoning steps to be analyzed by parsing its predicted chain-of-thought into symbolic logic. The authors evaluate instructGPT and GPT-3 on PrOntoQA and find that while these models can produce valid individual reasoning steps, they struggle with proof planning - selecting the correct sequence of steps to prove the goal. The models are prone to taking misleading steps during the proof which often lead to failure, though real-world knowledge from pretraining helps the models stay on track. Overall, the work sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for logical reasoning using a novel synthetic dataset for formal analysis of the predicted reasoning chains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new synthetic question answering dataset called PrOntoQA for evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). PrOntoQA generates examples from fictional ontologies and proofs so that reasoning ability can be tested separate from the model's factual knowledge. Each example consists of a context paragraph, query question, chain of reasoning, and answer label. The examples only require reasoning by modus ponens for tractability. The authors use PrOntoQA to evaluate InstructGPT and GPT-3. They semantically parse the models' predicted chains of reasoning into formal proofs for analysis. 

The key findings are: (1) The largest models can produce valid individual reasoning steps, even in fictional contexts. (2) However, the models struggle with proof planning - choosing the right sequence of reasoning steps to reach the goal. In particular, when multiple valid next steps are possible, the models often choose incorrectly and fail to complete the proof. The models do better on true ontologies, indicating reliance on real-world knowledge. The primary errors are due to misleading steps rather than invalid steps. Overall, this suggests LLMs have limited capabilities for complex logical reasoning. The synthetic QA dataset provides a useful benchmark for analyzing reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a new synthetic question answering dataset called PrOntoQA for evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to generate examples where each question has an underlying proof generated from a simple ontology, and the proof steps can be unambiguously mapped to sentences in the natural language chain-of-thought. This allows formal analysis of the predicted chain-of-thought by reconstructing the proof, checking its validity, and comparing it to the gold proof. 

Specifically, the dataset is generated in four steps: (1) Randomly generate a small ontology consisting of concepts and hierarchical "is-a" relationships. (2) Sample a proof by traversing the ontology using only the modus ponens deduction rule. (3) Translate the ontology into a natural language context paragraph. (4) Map each step of the proof into a simple declarative sentence to form the chain-of-thought and label. The controlled generation process allows testing under different conditions like fictional vs real-world ontologies and proof lengths.

The authors evaluate LLMs like InstructGPT and GPT-3 on PrOntoQA by prompting for the chain-of-thought. The predicted sentences are parsed into logical forms to reconstruct the proof, which is checked for validity and analyzed to identify reasoning errors. The results show that while LLMs can produce locally valid proof steps, they struggle with long proofs and optimal step selection. The analysis provides insights into strengths and limitations of LLM reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is evaluating the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) when provided with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. The abstract mentions that recent work has shown LLMs can perform logical reasoning tasks with high accuracy when provided CoT prompts, but it is unclear how much the models are actually reasoning vs relying on simple heuristics or just retrieving answers. 

To address this problem, the authors introduce a new synthetic QA dataset called PrOntoQA where the examples are generated from formal logical proofs. This allows them to parse the LLM's predicted CoT into symbolic logic proofs to formally analyze whether the model is applying rules of deduction correctly. Their analysis on InstructGPT and GPT-3 shows these models are capable of making valid deduction steps but have difficulty with "proof planning" - i.e. selecting the correct next step when there are multiple valid options. The models often take an incorrect step at these branch points which leads them to produce incomplete proofs.

So in summary, the key problem is evaluating whether LLMs prompted with CoT are truly reasoning, and the authors address this by designing a synthetic dataset where the CoT can be parsed into formal proofs for analysis. Their analysis reveals strengths and limitations of LLMs for logical reasoning tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper generates synthetic QA examples by first creating an ontology and then generating a proof from that ontology. What are some of the key decisions and trade-offs involved in designing the ontology generation process? For example, how does restricting the ontology to be linear affect the complexity and diversity of generated examples?

2. The paper uses a simple grammar to convert logical forms into natural language when generating the QA examples. What are some ways this grammar could be expanded to generate more complex and naturalistic questions, while still maintaining easy invertibility back to logical forms? How might this affect the reasoning capabilities tested?

3. When analyzing the predicted proofs, the paper proposes several different metrics for proof accuracy, ranging from strict to more lenient. Why is it useful to consider multiple metrics here? What are some of the tradeoffs involved in choosing a proof accuracy metric to evaluate reasoning capability? 

4. Could the method of generating synthetic QA examples be extended to test other forms of reasoning beyond modus ponens chained reasoning? What changes would need to be made to the ontology and proof generation process to expand the reasoning capabilities tested?

5. How sensitive are the results to the specifics of the grammar used to generate the natural language questions from logical forms? Could changes in the grammar formulation substantially change the difficulty of the resulting QA task?

6. The paper finds better reasoning performance on examples generated from true ontologies versus fictional/false ones. Why might this be the case? Does this indicate brittleness in language model reasoning capabilities?

7. What are some ways the analysis method could be expanded to provide more fine-grained insights into the model's reasoning process at each proof step? For example, could intermediate inferences be evaluated?

8. How does the synthetic QA approach compare to evaluation on human-generatedreasoning datasets? What are relative advantages and disadvantages of synthetic vs. natural datasets for this task?

9. Could the synthetic QA approach be used to generate targeted test cases that probe for specific reasoning weaknesses? How might it be used as part of a broader methodology for systematic testing?

10. The paper analyzes reasoning on simple syntactic variations of the questions. How could the analysis be expanded to probe reasoning robustness to more complex semantic variations in how questions are posed?
