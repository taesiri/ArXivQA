# [Noised Autoencoders for Point Annotation Restoration in Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07190)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Noised Autoencoders (NAE) method to mitigate the issue of inconsistent point annotations in object counting datasets. The approach draws inspiration from Masked Autoencoders (MAE), introducing random offsets to initial point annotations and requiring a UNet model to predict a vector field that restores them to the original positions. For unusual point annotations deviating far from common positions, NAE relies more on the general knowledge learned from numerous point annotations to guide their restoration. This process revises the point annotations to be more consistent. Extensive experiments spanning crowd, remote sensing, and cell counting datasets demonstrate NAE's effectiveness, steadily enhancing various state-of-the-art counting methods simply by using the refined annotations. Notably, NAE helps achieve new benchmark results on nine of the eleven assessed datasets. Beyond refined annotations, NAE also provides a pretrained backbone to further boost performance when integrated into existing approaches. This work offers an efficient and universally applicable solution to resolve the prevalent annotation inconsistency problem in point-based vision tasks.
