## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video generation models rely solely on limited user-provided image and text prompts, which fail to fully capture complex user intentions for customized video generation. This leads to unsatisfactory videos that do not meet user requirements. 

- Additional challenges include:
  - Text prompts may not depict intricate video motions and dynamics
  - Reference images lack temporal information 
  - Lack of intuitive control over video contents, semantics, motions

Proposed Solution - InteractiveVideo Framework
- Allows users to actively participate in video generation process through multimodal instructions:
  - Image instructions 
  - Textual content instructions  
  - Textual motion instructions
  - Trajectory instructions by dragging objects

- Synergistic Multimodal Instruction mechanism seamlessly integrates the above user inputs into video generation models without needing additional training

- Users can iteratively refine and tailor key aspects of videos (content, semantics, motions) until fully satisfied

Main Contributions:
- Novel interactive framework enabling dynamic user-model interaction for customized video generation  

- Synergistic Multimodal Instruction mechanism to effectively incorporate multidimensional user inputs

- Enables intuitive control over fine details of video content, semantics, motions based on user preferences

- Higher quality and more user-satisfying video generation compared to state-of-the-art methods

In summary, the paper introduces an interactive video generation paradigm that dynamic user guidance and multiple interaction mechanisms to empower users with an unprecedented level of control to create customized, high-quality videos catered to their preferences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Synergistic Multimodal Instruction mechanism to incorporate user interactions into the video generation process. Can you explain in more detail how this mechanism works to alter the predicted noise based on user operations? What is the intuition behind treating user interactions as denoising residuals?

2. Image instruction, content instruction, motion instruction and trajectory instruction are introduced as four distinct types of user instructions. Can you expand more on the specific forms/representations of these instructions and how they are utilized in the framework? 

3. The paper states that incorporating user interactions may affect temporal coherence of the generated video. The solution is to align each frame with the intermediate image using techniques from AnimateDiff. Why does this alignment step help improve temporal coherence?

4. The paper demonstrates video content manipulation by having users add new objects not present in the original image. How does the framework ensure seamless integration and realistic animation of these new objects? Does it pose challenges for temporal consistency?

5. For fine-grained regional editing, how does the framework interpret which region the user intends to edit? Does it require manual specification of regions? How are edits to a region propagated temporally?  

6. What modifications or additions need to be made to existing video diffusion models to enable interpretation and incorporation of the proposed user instructions? Does this require re-training or fine-tuning of models?

7. What are some ways the framework could be extended to support collaborative video generation with inputs from multiple users? What are some challenges this presents?

8. Could interactive video generation be useful for few-shot video generation based on limited data? Why or why not?

9. How computationally expensive is the proposed video generation pipeline compared to non-interactive counterparts? Could efficiency and scalability be issues?

10. The paper focuses on enabling better alignment with user preferences. Could there be risks related to bias, fairness and integrity of outputs when granting more user control? How can we promote responsible AI through interactive video generation?
