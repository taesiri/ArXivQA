# [Extended Version of: On the Structural Hardness of Answer Set   Programming: Can Structure Efficiently Confine the Power of Disjunctions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03539)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a useful framework for knowledge representation and AI, but evaluating disjunctive ASP programs is inherently very complex (Sigma_2^P-complete).
- For the structural parameter treewidth, under reasonable assumptions, disjunctive ASP requires double-exponential time, which is infeasible. 

Goal:
- Find preferably small structural parameters that allow single-exponential algorithms for evaluating disjunctive ASP programs.
- Investigate what makes disjunctive programs' structure harder to exploit than normal programs.
- Leverage the power of disjunction to reduce structural dependencies.

Results:
- Showed a polynomial kernel (reducible program instance) based on vertex cover size, yielding a single-exponential algorithm despite implicit subset minimization in ASP.

- New reduction from normal to disjunctive ASP that exponentially decreases feedback vertex set size (program cyclicity) from k to log(k).

- Tight double-exponential lower bounds under ETH for feedback vertex set size, distance to almost paths, treedepth and other parameters between vertex cover and treewidth.

- Argued that due to the vertex cover kernel and lower bounds for smaller parameters, there may not be much better structural parameters for disjunctive ASP.

Main Contributions:
- First single-exponential algorithm for disjunctive ASP based on vertex cover kernelization.

- Novel reduction that compresses structural dependencies for harder (disjunctive) programs. 

- Nearly complete dichotomy of prominent structural parameters between vertex cover and treewidth in terms of complexity.

- Evidence that vertex cover size may be the "end of the road" for further improvements via structural parameters.

The paper provides an extensive study on the effect of structure on the complexity of disjunctive ASP, guided by algorithms and lower bounds based on parameterized complexity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies the computational complexity of disjunctive answer set programming in terms of structural parameters of the program's rule structure, providing algorithms and hardness results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It shows that for disjunctive answer set programs, consistency can be decided in single-exponential time if the vertex cover size of the program's incidence graph is taken as the parameter. This is done by providing a polynomial kernel for the problem.

2) It provides a novel reduction technique that reduces normal (non-disjunctive) answer set programs to disjunctive ones, while exponentially decreasing structural parameters like feedback vertex set size and treedepth. This helps establish tight ETH-based lower bounds for these parameters.

3) Using the reduction idea, tight ETH-based double-exponential lower bounds are shown for several prominent structural parameters that lie between vertex cover and treewidth, like treedepth, feedback vertex set size, pathwidth, bandwidth, cliquewidth, and cutwidth.

4) The paper provides an in-depth understanding of the additional hardness incurred in disjunctive programs due to disjunction itself, and argues that beyond vertex cover, options for efficiently exploiting structure are quite limited.

In summary, the paper significantly advances our understanding of the structural complexity landscape for disjunctive answer set programming.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Answer set programming (ASP)
- Disjunctive logic programs
- Structural parameters (treewidth, vertex cover, feedback vertex set, treedepth, etc.)
- Parameterized complexity
- Kernels
- Reductions between logic program classes
- Exponential time hypothesis (ETH)

The paper deals with the parameterized complexity and kernels for checking consistency of disjunctive answer set programs based on structural parameters of the program. It provides algorithms and reductions related to parameters like vertex cover and feedback vertex set. It also presents lower bounds based on ETH for parameters like treewidth, treedepth, pathwidth, etc. Concepts like primal graph, incidence graph are also key as they are used to represent the structure of logic programs. Overall, the central theme is understanding how structural parameters can help confine the inherent complexity of solving disjunctive answer set programs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that disjunctive answer set programming is inherently difficult to solve efficiently even for simple structural parameters between vertex cover and treewidth. What are some ideas to identify more exploitable structural parameters that could still enable efficient solving?

2. The paper presents a novel technique to reduce normal answer set programs to disjunctive ones while exponentially decreasing structural dependencies. What are other potential applications of this reduction technique? Could it be useful for solving other problems?

3. The paper rules out single-exponential algorithms for various structural parameters like treedepth and feedback vertex set size. Are there any natural parameters remaining between vertex cover and treewidth that could still allow for efficient solving? 

4. How robust is the double-exponential lower bound for treewidth? Does it still hold if we consider only acyclic programs or restrict the syntax in certain ways while preserving expressivity?

5. The polynomial kernel for vertex cover relies on the bounded rule size of programs. How does the kernelization complexity behave if we relax this condition? Can we still obtain polynomial kernels?

6. The paper focuses on classical complexity. How do the results change in the context of parametrized complexity? Are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms possible for any small structural parameters?

7. What are some idea to leverage both classical structural parameters and semantic parameters of programs to identify fragment that are still efficiently solvable? 

8. The results indicate inherent limitations of structure for solving disjunctive programs. What alternative solving paradigms could overcome these limitations, e.g. by sacrificing semantics guarantees?

9. The reductions construct equivalent disjunctive programs. What happens for approximate solving? Can we obtain efficient approximation algorithms for small structural parameters?

10. The paper considers consistency checking. How do the results extend to other relevant reasoning tasks like brave/cautious reasoning and enumeration of solutions? Are there tasks that remain efficiently feasible?
