# [RETINAQA : A Knowledge Base Question Answering Model Robust to both   Answerable and Unanswerable Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing KBQA models assume all questions are answerable over the KB and fail to handle unanswerable questions. 
- Recently, the GrailQAbility benchmark was introduced which incorporates unanswerable questions into the popular GrailQA dataset.
- The unanswerable questions fall into categories - missing schema elements (no valid logical form) or missing data elements (valid logical form but empty answer).
- State-of-the-art KBQA models struggle with different categories when adapted for unanswerability detection.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose RETINAQA, a new KBQA model robust to answerability.
- It combines both traversal-based retrieval and sketch-filling based construction to generate candidate logical forms. This handles missing data elements.
- Discriminates between fully formed candidate logical forms instead of generating them. This helps in identifying invalid logical forms.
- Thresholding the score of top-ranked logical form to detect unanswerability.

Main Contributions:
- First KBQA model specialized for handling unanswerable questions along with answerable ones.
- Unifies complementary ideas from existing KBQA architectures to handle all categories of unanswerability.
- Discriminates between fully formed logical forms instead of generating. Better calibrated.  
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on GrailQAbility across answerable and unanswerable questions.
- Also establishes new SOTA on answerable-only GrailQA dataset.
- More robust to different train settings and test scenarios than existing KBQA models.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel KBQA architecture specially designed to handle unanswerability by combining the strengths of existing models, and shows significantly improved performance over adapting current models.
