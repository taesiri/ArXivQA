# [Learning for Semantic Knowledge Base-Guided Online Feature Transmission   in Dynamic Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18316)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel end-to-end communication system for efficient remote object recognition between a mobile device and an edge server. The system leverages a semantic knowledge base (SKB) and multi-level feature extraction to enable transmission of different levels of visual features based on channel quality and latency constraints. To tackle the challenge of unpredictably varying channels and device mobility, the paper formulates an online optimization problem to minimize semantic loss over time while meeting specified latency thresholds. Since this problem is NP-hard resembling a multi-choice knapsack problem, a soft actor-critic (SAC) based deep reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to obtain real-time transmission decisions. Through careful state and action definitions along with an intelligently designed reward function, the SAC agent learns to optimize feature transmission adapting to dynamic system states. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed approach over greedy baselines in terms of lower semantic loss and higher accuracy across varying latency constraints and SKB sizes. The paper provides valuable insights into leveraging SKB and reinforcement learning for efficient edge inference under fluctuating wireless environments.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting a model for a mobile device-server communication system for remote object detection that incorporates dynamic elements like moving mobile devices and fluctuating transmission channels. This is formulated as an online optimization problem with the goals of minimizing semantic loss and meeting specified transmission latency thresholds. 

2) Proposing a soft actor-critic (SAC) based deep reinforcement learning system to solve the online optimization challenge, which resembles an NP-hard multi-choice knapsack problem. The SAC system provides real-time multi-level feature transmission decisions at each time slot using a carefully designed reward function.

3) Demonstrating through numerical results that the proposed design achieves superior performance across various system configurations compared to two greedy baseline approaches, in terms of lower semantic loss, higher accuracy, and transmission latency constraints being met.

In summary, the key contribution is an innovative online optimization framework for efficient remote object recognition that leverages a semantic knowledge base, multi-level feature transmission, and an SAC-based deep reinforcement learning solver to address the challenges posed by dynamic real-world communication systems.
