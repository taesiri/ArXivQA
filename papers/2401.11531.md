# [Tempo: Confidentiality Preservation in Cloud-Based Neural Network   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11531)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Outsourcing deep learning (DL) model training to the cloud raises privacy concerns regarding both the training data (input privacy) and the trained model itself (model privacy). Existing systems using trusted execution environments (TEEs) fail to simultaneously utilize GPUs for efficient training while preventing model leakage.

Proposed Solution - Tempo:
This paper proposes Tempo, the first cloud-based DL training system that leverages both TEEs and distributed GPU workers for efficient training with model confidentiality. 

Key ideas:
- The TEE (Intel SGX) acts as the master and distributes computation to GPU workers. All communications go through the TEE.
- Linear ops like matrix multiplications dominate DNN computations. Tempo offloads these to GPUs after obfuscating the matrices (weights and inputs) using a novel permutation-based algorithm called MM-Obfuscation.
- MM-Obfuscation blinds matrices by permuting and scaling them using secret keys inside the TEE before sending to GPUs. Decryption and result verification happens in the TEE.
- An optimization is proposed to reuse computation results from the forward pass during backpropagation, avoiding re-encryption and reducing overhead.  

Main Contributions:
- First system for efficient and verifiable DNN training on the cloud with model privacy protection.
- Novel MM-Obfuscation algorithm that blinds both model weights and inputs for privacy while allowing linear operations on GPUs.
- Optimization of MM-Obfuscation during backpropagation by reusing prior encrypted results, reducing encryption overhead.  
- Open-source system implementation and comprehensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 showing 4.37x speedup over TEE-only baseline with same accuracy and robustness to attacks.

In summary, Tempo enables practical privacy-preserving outsourced DNN training by uniquely combining TEEs and GPU acceleration along with an optimized encrypted computation approach tailored for efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Tempo is the first distributed cloud-based deep learning training system that leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) and GPU workers to efficiently train neural networks while preserving both input and model privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Tempo, the first efficient TEE-assisted model privacy-preserving cloud DNN training system that collaborates between a TEE-equipped master and distributed GPU workers.

2. It introduces a customized matrix multiplication obfuscation (MM-obfuscation) algorithm that blinds both model weights and inputs for privacy preservation while allowing linear operations to be offloaded for efficient computation. This algorithm is further optimized during backpropagation to reduce encryption overhead. 

3. It implements Tempo prototypes and conducts comprehensive evaluations on two prominent DNNs. Results validate Tempo's efficiency, achieving 3.38-4.92x speedup over secure baselines in training and 3.09-52.73x over secure baselines in inference, without compromising accuracy or privacy.

In summary, the key contribution is the design and implementation of Tempo, which enables efficient and privacy-preserving DNN training in the cloud while protecting both the confidentiality of the model and the input data. The customized MM-obfuscation algorithm is vital to achieve this.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:
