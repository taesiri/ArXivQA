# [Physics-Aware Multifidelity Bayesian Optimization: a Generalized   Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many optimization problems in science and engineering rely on expensive high-fidelity models that limit their use for extensive queries. Multifidelity methods leverage cheaper low-fidelity models to accelerate the search, but still have to learn the modeling discrepancies between fidelities. However, domain knowledge about these discrepancies is often available but not used. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Physics-Aware Multifidelity Bayesian Optimization (PA-MFBO) framework that incorporates scientific and expert domain knowledge to improve the multifidelity optimization process. This is achieved by introducing a physics-aware multifidelity acquisition function that biases the selection of locations and fidelities to query based on the structure of the domain encoded in the physics knowledge.

Key Contributions:
- Formalizes a generalized approach to embed domain knowledge in multifidelity Bayesian optimization through a physics-aware utility function in the acquisition function  
- Demonstrates the framework on an aerodynamic design optimization problem, using knowledge of flow regime transitions to guide high-fidelity model queries
- Also applies it to a structural health monitoring problem, using expert knowledge of damage-load combinations to improve damage identification
- Shows superior performance over standard multifidelity Bayesian optimization in both cases - faster convergence and better optima with similar model queries
- Provides a broadly applicable technique to leverage available domain knowledge in multifidelity optimization without requiring problem-specific formulations

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to incorporate domain knowledge into multifidelity Bayesian optimization that demonstrates improved performance on problems from different domains. The generalized formulation and the application to diverse test cases highlight the broad relevance of encoding physics-awareness to enhance data-driven multifidelity searches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a physics-aware multifidelity Bayesian optimization framework that incorporates prior scientific and expert knowledge about the structure of the physical domain to accelerate optimization processes and enhance the accuracy of solutions for design and health monitoring problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a generalized formulation for physics-aware multifidelity Bayesian optimization (PA-MFBO) to embed prior scientific and expert knowledge about the physical domain into the optimization process. Specifically, it introduces a physics-aware multifidelity acquisition function that leverages domain knowledge to bias the selection of locations and fidelities to query. This allows PA-MFBO to accelerate the search and improve the accuracy of the solution by alleviating the need to learn the domain structure entirely from data. The paper demonstrates PA-MFBO on an aerodynamic design optimization problem, where it uses knowledge of flow regime transitions, and a structural health monitoring problem, where it uses expert knowledge of damage effects. Results show PA-MFBO outperforms standard Bayesian optimization methods by efficiently balancing model fidelity and computational cost to identify superior solutions. Overall, the key contribution is formalizing how to incorporate physical domain awareness into MFBO through a generalized utility function.
