## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first deep learning model for segmenting spiral arms and bars in galaxy images. The model is trained on crowdsourced masks from the Galaxy Zoo: 3D project to predict the fraction of volunteers marking each pixel. Using a U-Net architecture, the model learns to produce smooth, precise masks capturing the often ambiguous edges of spiral arms. In a blinded test, the model strongly outperformed both the closest existing automated approach (sparcfire) and the original crowdsourced labels, with astronomers rating the predicted spiral masks as “mostly good” to “perfect” in 89% of cases. Compared to manual measurements, bar lengths derived from the predicted masks showed excellent agreement. The model enables detailed morphological measurements, particularly relevant for surveys with integral field spectroscopy, and demonstrates deep learning can surpass crowdsourcing for ambiguous segmentation tasks. By producing accurate masks at scale, the model will facilitate research into how spiral arms and bars form and evolve.
