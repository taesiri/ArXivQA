# [TFB: Towards Comprehensive and Fair Benchmarking of Time Series   Forecasting Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies three key issues with existing time series forecasting (TSF) benchmarks that limit reliable and comprehensive comparisons of TSF methods:

1) Insufficient coverage of data domains: Existing benchmarks use datasets from limited domains, lacking diversity in time series characteristics. This limits evaluating method performance across diverse real-world scenarios. 

2) Bias against traditional methods: Existing benchmarks focus solely on recent deep learning methods, lacking traditional statistical and machine learning methods as baselines. This introduces unfair bias against traditional methods.

3) Inconsistent pipelines: Existing benchmarks have inconsistent data handling, lacking standardized evaluation strategies. This introduces biases and limits fair comparison of methods.

Solution:
To address these issues, the paper proposes the Time Series Forecasting Benchmark (TFB) with the following key features:

1) Comprehensive datasets: Includes univariate and multivariate time series datasets spanning 10 diverse domains to enable evaluating performance across a wide range of real-world scenarios.

2) Diverse methods: Supports statistical learning, machine learning and deep learning forecasting methods to eliminate bias against traditional techniques.  

3) Standardized pipeline: Provides flexible, scalable and standardized implementation pipeline for data handling, evaluation strategies and metrics to enable fair comparison.

Main Contributions:

1) TFB benchmark with 8,068 univariate and 25 multivariate time series spanning 10 domains.

2) Taxonomy and analysis of time series characteristics to demonstrate dataset diversity.  

3) Evaluation of 21 univariate and 14 multivariate forecasting methods with standardized pipeline.

4) Analysis of method performance across datasets and characteristics to provide guidance on method design.

5) Open-source TFB library of datasets, implementations and evaluation toolkit to promote TSF progress.

In summary, TFB advances time series forecasting benchmarking to enable more comprehensive, unbiased and reliable evaluation of forecasting methods to ultimately facilitate progress in this field.
