# [CREPE: Open-Domain Question Answering with False Presuppositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17257)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we build AI systems that can engage in open-ended dialog with humans in a natural, coherent and engaging manner?

The paper proposes a new dialog system called Meena that is trained end-to-end on massive conversational datasets and aims to conduct conversations that are more sensible and specific than existing chatbots. 

The key hypothesis is that scaling up current state-of-the-art neural conversational models by training on larger datasets, using larger models, and fine-tuning on realistic conversations will lead to more engaging chatbots. Meena is proposed as a benchmark for open domain chatbots and evaluated based on standard metrics as well as human evaluations.

In summary, the central research question is how to create chatbots that can have meaningful, engaging open-domain conversations, and the hypothesis is that scaling up neural conversational models will achieve this goal. Meena is presented as a new state-of-the-art model that makes progress towards that aim.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper introduces a new dataset called CREPE for identifying and correcting false presuppositions in open-domain questions. This is a novel contribution, as most prior QA datasets assume questions have valid answers, and do not focus on false presuppositions specifically. The most related dataset is from Kim et al. 2021 on unverifiable presuppositions, but their questions are limited to a narrow domain and do not contain many global factual errors.

- The paper proposes a realistic task setup for correcting false presuppositions in two tracks - one with just the question, and one with the question plus a comment. This is more challenging than existing QA tasks that provide relevant context documents. It requires retrieving evidence from a large corpus to identify false presuppositions.

- They provide a systematic categorization and analysis of the types of false presuppositions that occur in real user questions. This provides useful linguistic insights beyond what existing QA datasets offer.

- The baseline experiments demonstrate the difficulty of the task. Models struggle with retrieving relevant evidence and generating adequate corrections to explain the presupposition errors. Performance is far below human levels.

- The analysis and proposed dataset highlight major challenges for QA systems to handle false presuppositions. This is an underexplored area of research compared to factoid QA. The paper makes a strong case for why natural QA systems need to address these types of questions.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel task formulation and dataset that requires retrieving evidence and modeling pragmatic presuppositions. It represents a challenging extension to existing QA research to handle the types of questions people ask in the real world. The analysis provides insights into future research directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing better models for identifying implicit or subtle false presuppositions. The authors note that current models struggle with identifying more nuanced presuppositions that rely on causality, relationships between facts, exceptions, etc. Improving how models detect and handle these types of presumptions could lead to better performance.

- Exploring approaches to address the inherent ambiguity and debatability in judging the validity of presuppositions. The authors point out there is often some disagreement between annotators on whether a presupposition is truly false or not. New methods that can account for this ambiguity could help make systems more robust.

- Improving retrieval of evidence passages that identify false presuppositions. The authors found retrieval to be a major bottleneck, since passages on the relevant topic may not directly discuss the specific presupposition made. Better retrieval focused on identifying presupposition-related evidence could help.

- Developing improved evaluation schemes for judging the quality of generated corrections. The authors introduce a systematic human evaluation method, but note there is room for even better ways to assess the accuracy, adequacy, and consistency of generated presupposition corrections.

- Studying the application of methods to other specialized domains that require expertise, where false presumptions may be even more prevalent. The authors suggest domains like research papers and scientific reviews as promising candidates.

- Exploring different setups besides binary classification for handling questions with false presuppositions, to account for the inherent ambiguity in judging presuppositions.

In summary, key directions involve improving the detection, correction, and evaluation of false presuppositions, as well as extending the work to other domains and setups beyond the current binary classification approach. The authors have highlighted a number of open challenges that provide opportunities for impactful future work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing CREPE, a new dataset for open-domain question answering that contains 8,400 Reddit questions. 25% of the questions contain false presuppositions and are paired with annotated corrections of those presuppositions. 

2. Providing an analysis of the types of false presuppositions that occur, showing they range from explicit false clauses to more subtle false causality relationships.

3. Defining two tracks for correcting false presuppositions: one with just the question as input, and one with the question and a comment as input. These test open domain evidence retrieval vs having all necessary information.

4. Implementing baseline models, including nearest neighbors, classifiers, and retrieval + generation models. Results show challenges in retrieval, identification of implicit presuppositions, and explaining corrections.

5. Proposing both automatic and human evaluation schemes for this new task. The human evaluation considers fluency, correctness, adequacy and consistency of generated presuppositions and corrections.

6. Discussing open problems such as inherent ambiguity in presupposition validity and inconsistency between different web sources.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing a new benchmark dataset and task formulation for correcting false presuppositions in open-domain question answering. The analysis and baselines provide insights into the challenges and avenues for future work in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Crepe, a new QA dataset containing 8,400 Reddit questions, of which 2,202 (26%) have false presuppositions. For these questions with false presuppositions, annotations are provided for the presupposition and its correction. The data analysis shows that false presuppositions are diverse, ranging from explicit ones like false clauses to more subtle ones like false causality. Two tracks are defined - the main track where only the question is given, and the gold-comment track where the question and most upvoted comment are given. Baseline experiments using adaptations of existing QA models show moderate performance on identifying explicit false presuppositions, but difficulty with implicit presuppositions and generating adequate corrections. Key challenges are retrieving relevant evidence and generating accurate explanations. Overall, Crepe provides a new benchmark for studying QA with false presuppositions in open domains, highlighting opportunities for future work to address the challenges.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper introduces a new dataset called CREPE (Correction of Presupposition) consisting of 8,400 Reddit questions, of which 25% contain false presuppositions. The dataset contains annotations for the false presuppositions and their corrections. The authors collected the data by leveraging the most upvoted comments on Reddit, which tend to identify and correct false presuppositions. The data analysis shows the types of false presuppositions are diverse, including false clauses, false predicates, false properties, false causal relationships, and false existential presuppositions.  

Paragraph 2: The paper defines two task tracks: a main track where the model is only given the question, and a gold-comment track where the model is also given the comment. Baseline experiments are conducted on two subtasks - detecting whether a question contains a false presupposition, and generating the presupposition and correction. Results show models can moderately identify explicit false presuppositions, but struggle with implicit ones and explaining why presuppositions are false. Retrieval is a major bottleneck. The paper highlights open problems like inherent ambiguity in presuppositions and inconsistency between websites. Overall, the paper presents a new challenging dataset to study presupposition failure in open-domain QA.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces CREPE, a new dataset for the correction of false presuppositions in open-domain question answering. The key method used to create the dataset is leveraging the most upvoted comments from Reddit as a source of ground truth information. Specifically, the authors use the most upvoted comments to efficiently annotate 8,400 Reddit questions, identifying false presuppositions made in 25% of the questions and writing corrections for them. This allows them to collect high-quality data with low cost compared to having annotators search for evidence themselves. The use of most upvoted comments also helps address the inherent ambiguity in deciding if a presupposition is false, since these comments aggregate votes from many Reddit users. Overall, the main annotation method that enables the CREPE dataset is the use of Reddit's most upvoted comments as an efficient source of credible annotations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to identify and correct false presuppositions in open-domain questions. Specifically:

- Many open-domain questions contain false presuppositions - assumptions made by the question asker that are factually incorrect. For example, the sample question in the introduction incorrectly presupposes that the equal and opposite reactions in Newton's third law apply to the same object. 

- Existing question answering datasets and models focus on questions with valid direct answers or those that are unanswerable due to lack of evidence. They do not address questions with false presuppositions.

- The authors argue that questions with false presuppositions should not simply be considered unanswerable. Rather, a useful response is to identify the false presupposition and provide a correction explaining why it is incorrect.

- However, identifying false presuppositions requires global factual knowledge rather than just evidence from a context passage, presenting a challenge for QA systems. Generating adequate corrections that explain the mistake is also difficult.

To address this problem, the paper introduces a new dataset called CREPE containing open-domain questions from Reddit with annotated false presuppositions and corrections. It provides analysis of the types of false presuppositions that occur. The authors define a task of detecting whether a question contains a false presupposition and generating the presupposition and correction if so. They present baseline experiments on this task, identifying challenges models still face in retrieval, identification and explanation of false presuppositions.

In summary, the key problem is handling open-domain QA when the question contains false presuppositions, and the paper introduces a new dataset and task focused on identifying and correcting these presupposition errors.
