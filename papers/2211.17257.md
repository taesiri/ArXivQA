# [CREPE: Open-Domain Question Answering with False Presuppositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17257)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we build AI systems that can engage in natural conversation with humans, in a way that is coherent, consistent, and grounded in common sense and world knowledge?

The key hypothesis is that by training large neural network models on massive amounts of conversational data from the web, it may be possible to develop conversational agents that can engage in open-ended dialogue in a natural, human-like manner. 

In particular, the paper explores an approach based on retrieval-augmented generation, where the model retrieves relevant conversational history and background knowledge to inform its responses, rather than solely relying on past dialogue. The authors hypothesize that this retrieval-based approach will allow for more consistent, knowledgeable responses compared to models that only condition on the previous utterances.

The paper introduces a dataset called BlenderBot, which contains over 1.5 billion training examples mined from public web sources. They then detail a series of benchmark experiments training retrieve-and-refine models on this dataset to test their hypothesis. The results generally validate their hypothesis, showing that the retrieval augmentation leads to improved performance in terms of engagingness, consistency, avoiding contradictory responses, and utilizing knowledge.

In summary, the central hypothesis is around using massive data and retrieval-augmented generation to develop more consistent, knowledgeable open-domain conversational agents. The paper explores this hypothesis through dataset construction, model development, and benchmark evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Introducing CREPE, a new question answering dataset containing 8,400 Reddit questions, 25% of which have false presuppositions annotated along with corrections. This allows studying the problem of identifying and correcting false presuppositions in open-domain QA.

2. Providing an analysis of the types of false presuppositions present in the dataset, showing they range from explicit false clauses to more subtle implicit presuppositions.

3. Defining two task formulations - a main track where only the question is given, requiring retrieval of evidence, and an easier track where the annotated comment is also provided.

4. Establishing baseline results on the dataset using existing models, showing there is significant room for improvement. Key challenges identified include retrieving relevant evidence passages and identifying/explaining implicit false presuppositions.

5. Proposing both automatic metrics and a systematic human evaluation scheme for evaluating the subtasks of detecting false presuppositions and generating corrections.

6. Analyzing inherent ambiguities in judging presupposition validity and inconsistencies between different web sources, highlighting open problems in this space.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a new challenging QA dataset for correcting false presuppositions, along with detailed human annotations, analysis, task formulations, baselines and evaluation schemes to facilitate research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving retrieval of evidence passages that can identify false presuppositions. The authors found retrieval to be a major bottleneck in the task, with models failing to retrieve passages that directly explain how/why the presupposition is false. Improving retrieval methods specifically for this task could significantly boost performance.

- Better modeling techniques for identifying implicit/subtle presuppositions. The authors found models struggled to identify more nuanced or subtly implied presuppositions. Developing models that can better understand the underlying assumptions and implications in questions could help with these cases.

- Generating more adequate explanations for why presuppositions are false. The authors found models struggled to generate corrections that fully explain the reasoning behind the false presupposition. Exploring generation methods focused on explanatory adequacy could improve this aspect.

- Approaches to address the inherent ambiguity/debatability in judging presupposition validity. The authors discuss the difficulty of definitively determining if a presupposition is false, given differing backgrounds/viewpoints. New methods explicitly accounting for this ambiguity could help.

- Improved evaluation schemes for gauging the quality of presupposition/correction generations. The authors propose an initial human evaluation protocol, but further developing automatic and human evaluation specifically for this nuanced task is needed.

- Domain transfer to QA datasets in specialized domains that require expertise. The authors analyze false presuppositions in an NLP research QA set, suggesting domain transfer as a promising research direction.

Overall, the authors identify improving retrieval, identification, generation, evaluation, and domain adaptation for the correction of false presuppositions as key opportunities for future work based on their analyses.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CREPE, a new question answering dataset containing 8,400 questions from Reddit with annotations indicating whether the question contains a false presupposition. 25% of the questions have false presuppositions, and for these questions the annotations include the presupposition itself and a correction explaining why it is false. The authors categorize the types of false presuppositions, which range from false clauses to false causality relationships. They define two tasks: detecting whether a question has a false presupposition, and generating the presupposition and correction if it does. Baseline experiments using pretrained language models and passage retrieval struggle to identify implicit presuppositions and generate adequate explanations, indicating challenges for future work. Overall, the paper presents a new benchmark to study false presuppositions in open-domain QA, highlighting the need to retrieve relevant evidence and generate accurate corrections.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper introduces CREPE, a new question answering dataset containing 8,400 Reddit questions, of which 25% contain false presuppositions. The questions are paired with annotations identifying the false presupposition and a correction explaining why it is false. The most frequent types of false presuppositions include false clauses, false predicates, false properties, false causal relationships, and false existential presuppositions. The dataset is split into a main track where only the question is provided, and a gold-comment track where the comment is also provided. Baselines using passage retrieval and pretrained language models are presented for two subtasks: detecting whether a question contains a false presupposition, and generating the presupposition and correction if it exists.

Paragraph 2: Results show that retrieval remains a major bottleneck, as retrieving evidence contradicting presuppositions is challenging. Models do relatively well at identifying explicit false presuppositions, but struggle with implicit ones. For generation, models are better at extracting presuppositions from the question vs generating corrections requiring more understanding. Overall the dataset and experiments highlight difficulties in open-domain correction of false presuppositions, including retrieval, identification and generation. The authors suggest future work on better models, addressing ambiguity in presuppositions, and evaluating generated explanations. The data and baselines provide a benchmark for studying question answering when presuppositions are invalid.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset called CREPE for open-domain question answering with false presuppositions. The key method is leveraging the most upvoted comments from Reddit as a source of high-quality annotations. Specifically, the authors use the most upvoted comments to efficiently annotate questions with whether they contain false presuppositions, as well as the presuppositions themselves and corrections if so. This allows them to create a dataset of 8,400 Reddit questions, 25% of which have false presuppositions annotated along with corrections. The use of most upvoted comments allows efficient high-quality annotation by relying on the wisdom of the crowds rather than exhaustive individual annotation. The resulting dataset CREPE serves as a new benchmark for studying the challenging problem of identifying and correcting false presuppositions in open-domain QA.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper introduces a new dataset called CREPE for open-domain question answering. The dataset contains 8,400 questions from Reddit threads, of which 25% contain false presuppositions. 

- The questions with false presuppositions are paired with annotations identifying the presupposition and providing a correction.

- The goal is to study the challenging problem of answering questions that make false assumptions, which is common in real-world information seeking scenarios but not addressed in most existing QA datasets. 

- The authors define two subtasks: detecting whether a question contains a false presupposition, and generating the presupposition and correction if it does.

- Baseline experiments show that this is a difficult task, with the best models struggling to identify implicit presuppositions and adequately explain corrections. Retrieving relevant evidence is a major bottleneck.

- Analysis highlights open challenges around dealing with ambiguity, inconsistency, and inherent subjectivity in determining if a presupposition is false.

In summary, the key problem is handling real-world QA when questions make false assumptions, and the paper introduces a new benchmark to study this problem in an open-domain setting. The experiments and analysis reveal challenges that models still struggle with.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to related work in the field:

- This paper introduces a new dataset called CREPE for identifying and correcting false presuppositions in open-domain questions. Other QA datasets have focused on answerable questions or unanswerable questions due to lack of evidence. This paper is the first to tackle unanswerable questions with false presuppositions based on world knowledge.

- The paper finds that 25% of open-domain questions contain false presuppositions, making this an important problem. Prior work has studied presuppositions, but mostly in a formal semantics context rather than pragmatic presuppositions based on context and background knowledge.

- The paper proposes two tracks - one with just the question as input, and one with the question and a comment explaining the false presupposition. This is a more realistic setup than prior work that looked at presuppositions in reading comprehension with given context.

- Baseline methods are proposed using retrieval, classification, and generation models. Performance analysis shows difficulties in retrieval and identification/explanation of implicit presuppositions. This analysis informs future research directions.

- The paper connects to linguistics work on indirect responses and corrective presuppositions. It provides the first benchmark and models for this phenomenon based on real-world information seeking questions.

In summary, this paper introduces a new task and dataset that is highly relevant for open-domain QA but distinct from prior formulations. The data analysis and baselines provide novel insights into challenges like retrieval and implicit presuppositions. This paper opens up a promising new research direction at the intersection of QA, pragmatics and world knowledge.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces CREPE, a new question answering dataset for correcting false presuppositions in open-domain questions. The authors collect 8,400 real-world questions posted on Reddit, where 25% contain false presuppositions identified based on highly-voted community comments. These questions cover diverse types of false presuppositions, ranging from false clauses and predicates to false causal relationships. The paper defines two subtasks: detecting whether a question contains a false presupposition, and generating the presupposition itself along with a correction explaining why it is false. Through experiments with several baseline methods, the authors demonstrate that while current models can moderately identify more explicit false presuppositions, they struggle to retrieve relevant evidence and generate adequate corrections. The paper provides the first rigorous exploration of identifying and correcting false presuppositions in open-domain QA, highlighting major challenges that remain in retrieval, reasoning, and generation. CREPE serves as a new benchmark to develop and evaluate models for handling the prevalent but understudied phenomenon of false presuppositions in real-world information-seeking questions.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces CREPE, a new question answering dataset consisting of 8,400 Reddit questions, of which 25% contain false presuppositions and are paired with corrections of those presuppositions. The authors collected the data by leveraging highly upvoted comments that identify and correct false presuppositions made in questions. Detailed analysis shows the types of false presuppositions are diverse, including false clauses, predicates, properties, existential presuppositions, and false causal relationships. Baseline experiments on two tracks (with or without access to the comment) demonstrate that while current QA models can moderately identify explicit false presuppositions, they struggle to retrieve relevant evidence passages and generate adequate corrections explaining why presuppositions are false. The paper thus provides a challenging new benchmark for QA models to handle real-world questions with false presuppositions.
