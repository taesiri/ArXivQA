# [OpenViDial 2.0: A Larger-Scale, Open-Domain Dialogue Generation Dataset   with Visual Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main goal is to introduce OpenViDial 2.0, which is a larger-scale open-domain multi-modal dialogue dataset compared to the previous version OpenViDial 1.0. Specifically, OpenViDial 2.0 contains 5.6 million dialogue turns paired with visual contexts extracted from movies/TV shows, which is around 4 times larger than OpenViDial 1.0. The authors hope this larger dataset can facilitate future research on open-domain multi-modal dialog generation, such as multi-modal pretraining for dialog models. In summary, the central hypothesis is that releasing a bigger multi-modal dialog dataset (OpenViDial 2.0) can benefit the research community working on open-domain dialog generation with visual contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the release of OpenViDial 2.0, a large-scale open-domain multi-modal dialogue dataset. Specifically:

- OpenViDial 2.0 contains 5.6 million dialogue turns paired with visual contexts extracted from movies and TV shows. This is 4 times larger than the previous OpenViDial 1.0 dataset.

- Each dialogue turn consists of a textual utterance and a corresponding image representing the visual context. 

- The text is preprocessed using BPE tokenization. The images are in resolutions of 1280x720, 1920x1080 or 2048x1080.

- Experiments using models from prior work show OpenViDial 2.0 can facilitate research on multi-modal open-domain dialog generation.

In summary, the key contribution is the construction and release of OpenViDial 2.0 as a large-scale multi-modal dialog dataset to help drive further research in this area.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces OpenViDial 2.0, a large-scale open-domain multi-modal dialogue dataset with 5.6 million turns of dialog paired with visual contexts, which is 4 times larger than the previous OpenViDial 1.0 dataset.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in open-domain visual dialog generation:

- This paper introduces OpenViDial 2.0, an updated and significantly larger version of the OpenViDial dataset first introduced in Meng et al. 2020. At 5.6 million dialog turns, OpenViDial 2.0 is much larger than the original 1.1 million turns in OpenViDial 1.0.

- OpenViDial 2.0 focuses specifically on open-domain dialog with paired visual contexts, as opposed to other popular dialog datasets like VisDial and GuessWhat?! that focus on visual question answering. The goal is to facilitate research on dialog systems that can leverage both textual and visual context.

- The paper benchmarks performance of existing models from Wang et al. 2021 on the new OpenViDial 2.0. These models use different levels of visual features from no visual features to coarse image features to fine object features.

- The paper introduces the use of mutual information to strengthen the connection between generated dialog and visual context, improving performance over models that don't explicitly model this dependency.

- Overall, this represents an incremental contribution in scale and benchmarking for the task of open-domain visual dialog. It provides a larger dataset to facilitate future research. The models benchmarked are still fairly simple baselines.

In summary, the introduction of a larger-scale dataset pushes forward the research direction of open-domain visual dialog systems. But significant innovations in model architecture will likely be needed to make further progress on this challenging task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Pretraining larger multi-modal dialog models on OpenViDial 2.0 or other large-scale multi-modal dialog datasets. The authors suggest OpenViDial 2.0 can facilitate pretraining of large multi-modal dialog models, similar to how large text corpus like BookCorpus and Wikipedia have enabled pretraining of large language models like BERT.

- Exploring different multi-modal fusion methods to better model the interplay between textual and visual contexts in dialog. The authors suggest the vanilla visual dialog models they experimented with are basic. More sophisticated fusion methods could be developed.

- Building better text-visual mutual dependency models. The authors propose a simple discriminative model to build text-visual dependency. More complex models could be explored. 

- Combining retrieval-based methods with generative methods for multi-modal dialog by using OpenViDial 2.0. The authors suggest retrieval from large multi-modal corpora like OpenViDial 2.0 could complement generative methods.

- Exploring other open-domain dialog tasks enabled by OpenViDial 2.0, such as dialog state tracking. The authors suggest the dataset could facilitate research beyond just open-domain dialog generation.

- Developing unsupervised metrics to evaluate multi-modal dialog generations. The authors use only automatic metrics like BLEU in their experiments but suggest better evaluation metrics are needed.

In summary, the key directions are pretraining larger models on OpenViDial 2.0, developing better fusion methods, building better text-visual dependency, combining retrieval and generative methods, exploring other tasks like state tracking, and creating better automatic evaluation metrics. The large scale of OpenViDial 2.0 enables many future research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces OpenViDial 2.0, a large-scale open-domain multi-modal dialogue dataset with visual contexts. This is an updated and expanded version of OpenViDial 1.0, containing 5.6 million dialogue turns extracted from movies and TV shows, each paired with a corresponding image representing the visual context. Compared to version 1.0 which had 1.1 million turns, OpenViDial 2.0 is over 4 times larger in scale. The authors constructed the dataset by segmenting videos into frames, aligning subtitle text to image frames, and splitting into dialog turns. They evaluate vanilla visual dialog models on the data and show the effect of incorporating different levels of visual features, from no visual features to coarse image features to fine object features. The larger scale of OpenViDial 2.0 compared to other visual dialog datasets is intended to facilitate future research on open-domain multi-modal dialog generation, such as multi-modal pretraining. The dataset and code are publicly available.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces OpenViDial 2.0, an updated and expanded version of the OpenViDial dataset for multi-modal open-domain dialog. OpenViDial 2.0 contains 5.6 million dialog turns extracted from movies and TV shows, each paired with a visual context image representing the scene in which the dialog occurs. The dialog turns and images were extracted by segmenting videos into frames, aligning subtitle text to frames using timing information, and splitting the aligned text-image pairs into dialog turns. The resulting dataset is over 4 times larger than the previous 1.1 million turn version. The authors demonstrate the use of OpenViDial 2.0 by training and evaluating a variety of neural dialog models on it, including uni-modal text-only models as well as multi-modal models that incorporate visual features. The multi-modal models are shown to benefit from the additional visual context, especially when fine-grained visual features are used. Overall, the large-scale OpenViDial 2.0 enables research into multi-modal open-domain dialog generation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are trying to address is the lack of large-scale datasets for multi-modal open-domain dialog generation. Specifically:

- Most existing dialog datasets are focused on textual dialog only, without accompanying visual context. 

- Existing visual dialog datasets are more focused on visual question answering, rather than open-domain dialog generation where the dialog is grounded in visual contexts.

- The authors' previous OpenViDial 1.0 dataset aimed to provide visual grounding for dialog, but was still limited in scale at 1.1 million examples.

To address this issue, the authors introduce OpenViDial 2.0, a significantly larger open-domain dialog dataset grounded in visual contexts. The key contributions are:

- OpenViDial 2.0 contains 5.6 million text-visual dialog examples, around 5 times bigger than the previous 1.1 million example dataset.

- The dialogs and images are extracted from movies and TV shows to better mimic real visual conversations.

- They demonstrate the dataset's utility by training and evaluating multimodal dialog models on it.

So in summary, the main problem is the lack of large-scale multi-modal dialog data, which OpenViDial 2.0 aims to provide to enable future research in this direction.
