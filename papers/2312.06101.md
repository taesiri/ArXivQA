## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Hundred-Kilobyte Look-up Tables (HKLUTs), an innovative family of ultra-compact lookup table (LUT) based models for efficient single image super-resolution (SISR). The key innovation is the design of asymmetric parallel branches with specialized big-little kernel patterns that are tailored to the intrinsic receptive field differences between the most and least significant bits. This allows cutting the LUT size nearly in half without performance drops. Further savings are attained via a compact multistage architecture, which uniquely enables inter-branch communication, and progressive upsampling that elegantly halves the LUT size per stage. When seamlessly integrated, HKLUTs constitute the smallest SISR LUT models to date, attaining over 30dB PSNR on benchmarks with merely 100KB footprints. Extensive experiments prove HKLUTs as versatile alternatives to prior much larger LUT schemes, delivering competitive runtime, energy efficiency and restoration quality at over 10-100Ã— smaller sizes. As the first sub-100KB high-performance SISR series, HKLUTs align perfectly with the regime of edge AI applications with stringent hardware budgets.
