# [InjectTST: A Transformer Method of Injecting Global Information into   Independent Channels for Long Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent Transformer-based MTS forecasting models generally use channel-independent structures, which helps mitigate noise and distribution drift issues. However, channel-mixing structures better capture inter-channel dependencies and information.  
- Designing a model that incorporates merits of both channel independence (robustness) and channel mixing (high capacity) is key to improving MTS forecasting performance. But it poses a challenging tradeoff.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose InjectTST, which retains a channel-independent backbone structure but injects cross-channel global information into each channel selectively. This implicitly achieves channel mixing while preserving noise mitigation capabilities.

Key Components of InjectTST:
- Channel Identifier: Learns distinct representation for each channel to improve channel specificity.
- Global Mixing Module: Mixes cross-channel information to produce global representation. Two designs proposed - CaT and PaT.  
- Self-Contextual Attention Module: Injects global information into each channel selectively via a cross-attention mechanism, avoiding noise.

Contributions:  
- Presents a new framework to bridge channel-independent and channel-mixing models via selective injection of global information into robust backbones.
- Proposes InjectTST implementing this framework with three key components - channel identifier, global mixing modules, and self-contextual attention.
- Experiments show InjectTST achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MTS forecasting datasets with negligible robustness impact.
- Analysis provides insights into designing both channel-mixing and channel-independent MTS models.

Overall, InjectTST provides an effective and promising solution direction to combine the advantages of channel independence and channel mixing for advancing MTS forecasting performance.
