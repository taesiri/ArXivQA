# [GPT as Psychologist? Preliminary Evaluations for GPT-4V on Visual   Affective Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal language models (MLMs) like GPT-4V show promise for affective computing tasks involving emotion recognition from visual and physiological signals. However, standardized evaluation benchmarks are lacking to accurately assess their capabilities.

Objective:  
- Evaluate GPT-4V across 5 key abilities - facial action unit recognition, expression recognition, compound emotion recognition, micro-expression recognition and micro-gesture recognition.

Approach:
- Test GPT-4V on standard datasets using iterative conversations, open-ended questions and multiple choice questions.
- Also assess capability for advanced tasks like deception detection and heart rate estimation by calling Python tools.

Key Findings:
- Highly accurate in recognizing facial action units and detecting micro-expressions.
- Limitations in recognizing general facial expressions without context. Accuracy improves when incorporating thought chain prompting.
- Can recognize obvious micro-gestures but not subtle ones.
- Unable to detect deception in videos. Subjective tasks remain challenging.
- Can call Python tools to process signals and estimate heart rate. Shows potential for human-computer collaboration frameworks.

Main Contributions:
- First standardized assessment of GPT-4V across multiple abilities key for affective computing.
- Demonstrates strengths in recognizing facial action units and micro-expressions.   
- Identifies challenges in facial expression recognition and limitations for subjective tasks.
- Highlights the versatility of GPT-4V in handling advanced tasks by integrating with task-specific tools.
- Discusses future scope for research to overcome limitations in emotion recognition.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights into capabilities and limitations of MLMs for human-centric computing tasks, while also demonstrating the potential for human-computer collaboration.
