# [Among Us: Adversarially Robust Collaborative Perception by Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09495)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper appears to address the following main research question:

How can multiple robots collaborate perceptually to achieve better scene understanding while defending against adversarial attacks in a computationally efficient and generalizable manner?

The key points are:

- Multi-robot collaboration can improve perception compared to individual robots, but is vulnerable to adversarial attacks when using deep neural networks.

- Existing defenses like adversarial training require knowledge of the attack method and can reduce accuracy. 

- This paper proposes a new defense approach called ROBOSAC that is computationally efficient, generalizable to unseen attacks, and scalable.

- The main idea is to use hypothesis testing to verify consensus between individual vs collaborative perception results to detect potential attackers.

- They optimize the number of collaborators and sampling budget to balance performance and computation.

- They also propose a method to estimate unknown attacker ratios by starting optimistic and getting more conservative.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that consensus-based adversarial sample detection can enable efficient, scalable, and generalizable defense for multi-robot perceptual collaboration. The paper seems to aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a novel framework called ROBOSAC for adversarialy robust collaborative perception in multi-robot systems. The main contributions are:

- It proposes a sampling-based approach called ROBOSAC that allows robots to collaborate safely without being fooled by adversarial attacks. The key idea is to sample subsets of teammates and verify consensus between collaborative and individual results before using shared information.

- It provides a theoretical analysis on the performance-computation tradeoff - how to maximize the number of benign collaborators or minimize sampling steps given constraints. 

- It develops an adaptive probing method called A2CP to estimate the unknown attacker ratio by starting from an aggressive assumption and gradually becoming more conservative.

- It validates ROBOSAC for collaborative 3D object detection in autonomous driving. The method demonstrates better generalizability than adversarial training since it is agnostic to attack methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed ROBOSAC framework that enables efficient, scalable and generalizable defense against adversarial attacks for multi-robot collaborative perception. It does not rely on knowing the attack method. The key novelty is using sample consensus to identify benign collaborators.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework called ROBOSAC for achieving robust collaborative perception between multiple robots by using random sampling to identify benign collaborators and reach a consensus, thereby defending against adversarial attacks in a scalable and generalizable manner without needing to know the specific attacking method.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research on collaborative perception:

- The main novelty of this paper is proposing the ROBOSAC framework for robust collaborative perception against adversarial attacks. This is different from most prior work that focuses on improving robustness via adversarial training, which requires knowing the attack method. 

- ROBOSAC is based on the idea of consensus - checking if perception results with and without collaboration are consistent. If not, it indicates presence of adversarial messages from teammates. This concept of consensus verification is unique compared to typical adversarial defenses.

- The paper derives a relationship between the number of sampling trials and the guaranteed maximum number of benign collaborators that can be identified, based on the attacker ratio. This allows customizing the framework for either performance or efficiency.

- For unknown attacker ratios, the paper proposes an aggressive-to-conservative probing method to estimate the ratio online. This adaptive approach is more realistic than assuming the ratio is given.

- Experiments are conducted on collaborative 3D object detection for autonomous driving. This is a relevant safety-critical application that can benefit from the proposed defense framework. 

- Compared to adversarial training defenses, ROBOSAC demonstrates better generalizability to unseen attack methods in the experiments. This addresses a key limitation of common adversarial training approaches.

Overall, the core ideas of consensus verification and adaptive ratio estimation provide a unique perspective on robust collaborative perception. The framework allows trading off performance and efficiency without knowing the attackers. These aspects help advance the state-of-the-art in this emerging research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced attackers that can generate subtle yet dangerous perturbations to bypass the "outlier-detection-based" defense mechanism proposed in this work. The current method assumes the adversarial noise causes a significant change in the output, but future attacks may be able to fool the system while producing less noticeable changes in the outputs. 

- Considering scenarios where the attacker ratio varies over time, rather than assuming it is fixed. The method currently assumes a fixed ratio for deriving the number of sampling steps, but allowing the ratio to change dynamically could be more realistic.

- Applying and evaluating the proposed approach on more collaborative perception tasks beyond 3D object detection, such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, etc. Assessing the general applicability of the method to other perception tasks would be valuable.

- Exploring alternatives beyond gradient-based attacks, such as generative adversarial networks for crafting adversarial examples. Defending against a wider range of possible attacks would further improve robustness.

- Reducing the computational overhead of the sampling-based consensus verification, to improve efficiency and enable deployment on systems with tighter time constraints. Optimizing the implementation could help scale the approach.

- Validating the method on physical multi-robot systems, rather than just in simulation. Testing the real-world feasibility would be an important next step towards deployment.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more advanced and subtle attackers, handling varying attacker ratios, applying the method to more tasks, evaluating broader attack types, improving computational efficiency, and validating on physical systems. Overall, they aim to improve the robustness, generalizability, scalability, and real-world applicability of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents \acronym~, an approach for robust collaborative perception against adversarial attacks in multi-agent systems. The key idea is to intelligently select benign teammates to maximize the use of complementary information while resisting adversarial attackers. It uses a hypothesize-and-verify framework inspired by RANSAC, where perception results with and without collaboration from randomly sampled subsets of teammates are compared until reaching consensus. More teammates improve performance but require more sampling trials to reject attackers, so trade-offs are analyzed between performance and computation. An aggressive-to-conservative probing method is also proposed to estimate the attacker ratio when unknown. Experiments on collaborative 3D object detection for autonomous driving validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach. Overall, the paper provides a novel consensus-based defense strategy to improve adversarial robustness in collaborative perception without relying on specific attack knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called ROBOSAC (ROBust cOllaborative SAmple COnsensus) for robust multi-robot perception under adversarial attacks. The key idea is to use a sample consensus approach to identify benign collaborators among a team of robots, some of which may be sending adversarial messages. Specifically, the ego robot samples subsets of teammates and compares perception results with and without them until reaching a consensus, indicating no attackers are present. More collaborators improve perception but require more sampling to reject attackers, so there is a performance-computation tradeoff. The authors derive how to maximize collaborators or minimize sampling steps for a given budget and consensus probability.  

For unknown attacker ratios, the paper develops an aggressive-to-conservative probing method starting with more collaborators and reducing if consensus fails. Experiments in collaborative 3D detection for autonomous vehicles show ROSOSAC can efficiently identify benign teammates. Unlike adversarial training, it is agnostic to attack types and thus more generalizable. Overall, this sample consensus approach provides an efficient, scalable and generalizable defense against adversarial attacks in multi-robot perception. The key strengths are avoiding the need to know attackers and balancing performance versus computation when selecting collaborators.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the main method in one paragraph:

The paper proposes a novel adversarially robust collaborative perception framework called ROBOSAC (ROBust cOllaborative SAmple CConsensus). The key idea is to enable each robot (termed ego-robot) to intelligently select benign collaborators from teammates using a hypothesize-and-verify procedure with random sampling, instead of naively trusting all teammates' messages which could contain adversarial attacks. Specifically, the ego-robot samples a subset of teammates and compares the collaborative perception results using their messages with its individual perception results. If a consensus is reached, the sampled teammates are considered benign. This process is repeated within a sampling budget until the ego-robot finds a maximum number of benign collaborators to improve its perception while avoiding being attacked. Unlike common adversarial training defenses which require knowing the attack method, ROBOSAC is attacker-agnostic and thus more generalizable. Experiments on collaborative 3D detection for autonomous vehicles validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROBOSAC.
