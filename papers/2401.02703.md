# [Verifying Relational Explanations: A Probabilistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explaining predictions from graph neural networks (GNNs) is challenging since the explanations are complex graph structures which are hard to verify. 
- Typically human subjects are used to verify the quality of explanations, but this does not scale up for relational explanations from GNNs which require expertise.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a probabilistic approach to quantify uncertainty in the explanations generated by GNNExplainer.
- Generate multiple counterfactual examples by creating symmetric approximations of the original graph using low-rank Boolean factorization.
- Explain the counterfactual examples also using GNNExplainer. 
- Learn a factor graph model over the counterfactual explanations to capture the distribution. 
- Perform probabilistic inference on the factor graph to estimate uncertainty in the relations specified in an explanation.

Main Contributions:
- A novel way to learn a factor graph over symmetric counterfactual examples to quantify uncertainty in GNN explanations.
- Leverages belief propagation on the learned model to estimate likelihood of relations in an explanation.
- Evaluated on several benchmark datasets by removing uncertain relations and measuring difference in predictions.
- Show the uncertainty estimates from the proposed approach are statistically more significant than the uncertainty scores from GNNExplainer.
- The approach provides a method to verify quality of explanations from GNNs which does not require human expertise.

In summary, the key idea is to learn a probabilistic model over symmetric counterfactual explanations in order to reliably estimate the uncertainty in relations specified by an explanation from GNNExplainer. The results demonstrate this approach can verify the quality of explanations without needing domain experts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a probabilistic approach to verify the uncertainty in relational explanations from graph neural networks by learning a factor graph model over symmetric counterfactual explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an approach to verify the quality and uncertainty of explanations generated by GNNExplainer. Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Learn a distribution over counterfactual relational explanations by generating symmetric approximations of the input graph using low-rank Boolean factorization. 

2) Represent this distribution as a factor graph and use belief propagation to estimate the uncertainty in relations specified in an explanation.

3) Quantify the reduction in uncertainty when new knowledge from an explanation is incorporated into the factor graph. 

4) Evaluate the statistical significance of the uncertainty estimates by removing relations from the input graph based on these estimates and analyzing the impact on predictions of a Graph Convolutional Network using McNemar's test.

In summary, the main contribution is a probabilistic graphical model based approach to reliably quantify the uncertainty in relational explanations produced by methods like GNNExplainer in order to verify and validate their quality.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Relational explanations - The paper focuses on explaining predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs) which operate on relational graph data. So relational explanations refer to explaining GNN predictions.

- Counterfactual explanations - The core idea in the paper is to generate counterfactual examples of the input graph and explain those using GNNExplainer to learn a distribution over explanations. Counterfactual examples are variations of the input data.

- Uncertainty quantification - The paper develops a probabilistic approach based on factor graphs to quantify the uncertainty in explanations provided by GNNExplainer. Uncertainty quantification refers to estimating reliability of an explanation.

- Symmetric approximations - To generate counterfactual examples, the paper uses low-rank Boolean matrix factorization which introduces symmetries and generates symmetric approximations of the original graph.

- Belief propagation - This is the algorithm used to perform probabilistic inference on the factor graph in order to quantify uncertainty.

- McNemar's test - The statistical test used to evaluate whether the uncertainty quantification method can reliably estimate significance of relations in explanations.

In summary, the key focus is on verifying and quantifying uncertainty in relational explanations for GNNs using counterfactual examples and probabilistic graphical models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes generating counterfactual explanations by creating symmetric approximations of the original graph using low-rank Boolean factorization. What is the intuition behind using symmetric approximations as counterfactuals? How does this capture uncertainty better compared to random perturbations?

2. Explain the process of performing low-rank Boolean factorization on the adjacency matrix of the original graph. What objectives guide the choice of rank in the factorization? How does the rank impact the types of symmetries induced?  

3. The paper represents the distribution over counterfactual explanations as a factor graph model. Walk through the details of constructing the factor graph - what are the variable and factor nodes? How are the factor functions designed? What inferences do they aim to capture?  

4. Explain the message passing equations for belief propagation in the context of the factor graph used in this paper. What role does the initialization of the factor weights play in the final calibrated model?

5. The paper claims that using belief propagation on the factor graph model quantifies uncertainty better than the conditional entropy measure used in GNNExplainer. Elaborate on why this is the case. What additional signals does the factor graph leverage?

6. Walk through the process of using the calibrated factor graph model to estimate the uncertainty of a new explanation from GNNExplainer. How is the marginal distribution compared before and after incorporating the new explanation? 

7. The evaluation uses the McNemar test to compare uncertainty estimates from the paper's method against GNNExplainer. Explain how the McNemar test is set up for this scenario and how the statistic indicates better uncertainty quantification.

8. Analyze the experimental results on the different benchmark datasets. On which datasets does the proposed approach perform better? When does GNNExplainer provide competitive uncertainty estimates?

9. The paper assumes binary relationships in the formulation of the factor graph model. How can this approach be extended to capture more complex relations with multiple discrete or continuous attributes?

10. A key aspect of the approach is the use of symmetric approximations to generate counterfactual explanations. Can you think of other principles for counterfactual generation that could encode useful priors for the uncertainty estimation task?
