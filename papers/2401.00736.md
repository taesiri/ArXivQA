# [Diffusion Models, Image Super-Resolution And Everything: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the application of diffusion models (DMs) for image super-resolution (SR). Image SR aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input image. It is an ill-posed problem with multiple possible HR solutions for a given LR input. Recently, DMs have emerged as a leading technique for image generation and SR by gradually adding noise to data samples and then reversing the process. 

The paper first provides background on image SR, including problem formulation, standard datasets, model architectures, and evaluation metrics. It then introduces the basics of DMs, including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Further, it discusses common practices to improve DMs like efficient sampling and likelihood estimation. 

The core contribution is a detailed analysis of DM applications for image SR. This includes concrete realizations like SR3, alternative input domains such as latent and wavelet, conditioning strategies using LR images or text embeddings, zero-shot methods leveraging pre-trained DMs, and corruption spaces. Architectural designs, the problem of color shifting and domain-specific applications like medical imaging, blind face restoration, atmospheric turbulence, and remote sensing are also covered.

The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations and future directions. Key issues include color shifting, computational costs, efficient sampling, and model comparability. Promising research avenues are highlighted such as image manipulation, cascaded generation, alternative corruption spaces, score estimation, and the integration of DMs with other techniques like wavelets or vision transformers.

Overall, this paper provides a unified view of a rapidly evolving field. It offers valuable insights to both novice and experienced researchers on the unique characteristics of DMs for image SR. The comprehensive analysis and future outlook will help accelerate progress in this domain.
