# [SHIELD : An Evaluation Benchmark for Face Spoofing and Forgery Detection   with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks (e.g. print, replay, masks) and digital forgeries (e.g. DeepFakes). Most research focuses on developing models for specific attack types, lacking adaptability.  
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable problem-solving abilities in vision tasks, but their effectiveness for subtle spoof/forgery clues in face attack detection is unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new benchmark "SHIELD" to evaluate MLLMs on face spoofing and forgery detection. Design true/false and multiple-choice questions to test on multimodal face data.
- Propose a Multi-Attribute Chain of Thought (MA-COT) approach to describe/judge various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images, providing rich task knowledge for subtle clue mining.

Main Contributions:
- New benchmark to assess MLLMs on face anti-spoofing and forgery detection tasks, with multimodal data across diverse scenarios.
- Novel MA-COT paradigm that extracts key attributes for real/fake face discrimination, enhancing interpretability. 
- Experiments show MLLMs have potential spoof/forgery reasoning capability and outperform traditional models in terms of flexibility, unified detection ability and interpretability. MA-COT further improves robustness and explainability.

In summary, this paper explores MLLMs for face attack detection, proposes evaluation benchmarks and enhancement techniques, demonstrating advantages over specialized models in unified, interpretable and flexible detection. The MA-COT approach also aids robustness and explainability.
