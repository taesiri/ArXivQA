# [Accurate Leukocyte Detection Based on Deformable-DETR and Multi-Level   Feature Fusion for Aiding Diagnosis of Blood Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional manual leukocyte isolation and analysis from blood smears is time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone. This can negatively impact subsequent automatic leukocyte classification and disease diagnosis.
- Contemporary leukocyte detection methods have limitations in handling images with scarce leukocyte features and scale variation between leukocytes, leading to unsatisfactory performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR) method for automatic and accurate leukocyte detection.

Key Components:
- Backbone Network: Enhanced ResNet50 extracts multi-scale image features.  
- High-level Screening Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN): Addresses scale variation via multi-level fusion. High-level features filter low-level features via channel attention. Filtered features are merged with high-level features for enhanced representation.
- Encoder: Learns global image features via multi-scale deformable self-attention module.
- Decoder: Learns object locations from encoder features using self-attention and cross-deformable attention. Matches outputs to ground truth via bipartite graph matching.

Joint Loss Function:
- Combines classification (focal), regression (GIoU+L1) and auxiliary losses to optimize model.

Key Contributions:
- Novel HS-FPN handles unique leukocyte scale variation more effectively than other fusion methods.
- Multi-scale deformable self-attention reduces complexity and enhances detection efficacy.
- MFDS-DETR achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on public LISC, BCCD and private WBCCD leukocyte datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.
- WBCCD dataset with leukocyte bounding box annotations is released to facilitate research.

In summary, the proposed MFDS-DETR method addresses key limitations of existing leukocyte detection approaches via targeted multi-level fusion and deformation modeling, achieving superior detection accuracy. The high-quality annotated dataset further enables leukocyte analysis research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel leukocyte detection method called Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR) that effectively addresses the challenges of limited features and scale variations in leukocyte images to achieve accurate detection and counting of different leukocyte types to aid disease diagnosis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces a novel method called MFDS-DETR (Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR) for fine-grained leukocyte detection. This method uses multi-scale fusion and deformable self-attention.

2. It designs a High-level Screening-feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) module tailored for the characteristics of leukocytes and the scale gaps among them. This module selectively fuses high-level and low-level features for better detection. 

3. It assembles a new leukocyte detection dataset called WBCCD with annotations, captured from multiple local hospitals. This dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate research in this area.

4. It incorporates a multi-scale deformable self-attention module in the encoder to extract global features of leukocyte images, which helps with detection.

5. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed MFDS-DETR method compared to other state-of-the-art leukocyte detection models. This shows its effectiveness and generalizability.

In summary, the key contributions are: proposing the novel MFDS-DETR model, designing the HS-FPN module for better feature fusion, creating a new dataset, using multi-scale deformable self-attention, and demonstrating superior detection performance.

7. The HS-FPN module combines transposed convolution and bilinear interpolation for upsampling high-level features. Justify why this combination is more effective than using bilinear interpolation alone.

8. The number of encoder and decoder layers impacts overall model performance. Analyze the trends observed when varying the number of layers based on the ablation experiments.
