# [Uncertainty Quantification with Deep Ensembles for 6D Object Pose   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate and reliable 6D object pose estimation (position and orientation) from images is critical for applications like robot manipulation, augmented reality, etc. 
- While deep learning methods achieve high accuracy, quantifying the uncertainty of the pose estimates is also important to identify ambiguous cases.
- Applying uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods like deep ensembles to multi-stage pose estimation methods is challenging as they are designed for end-to-end models.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply deep ensembles for UQ to the SurfEmb method for 6D object pose estimation. SurfEmb uses a correspondence network to predict 2D-3D matches and PnP to estimate pose.
- Train an ensemble of SurfEmb models with random initialization and evaluate estimated predictive uncertainty.
- Propose a novel Uncertainty Calibration Score (UCS) metric to quantify quality of uncertainty estimates for regression tasks.

Experiments:
- Train and evaluate ensemble of 10 SurfEmb models on standard datasets T-LESS and YCB-V.
- SurfEmb ensemble achieves comparable pose accuracy to original SurfEmb.
- The ensemble's correspondence predictions are very well calibrated but calibration reduces in later stages.
- Choices like pose refinement and orientation representation impact uncertainty calibration.  
- UCS confirms observations from reliability diagrams and provides an interpretable quantification of uncertainty calibration.

Main Contributions:
- First application of deep ensembles for UQ to a multi-stage 6D object pose estimation method
- Analysis of uncertainty calibration for different design choices using proposed UCS metric
- Insights on applying deep ensembles to non end-to-end pose estimation methods
