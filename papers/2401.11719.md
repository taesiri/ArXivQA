# [SFC: Shared Feature Calibration in Weakly Supervised Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11719)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- In weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), class activation maps (CAMs) are used to generate pseudo-labels for training segmentation models. 
- However, the authors find that long-tailed distribution in the training data causes the shared features between head and tail classes to become positively biased in head class classifier weights and negatively biased in tail class weights. 
- This leads to over-activation of CAMs for head classes and under-activation for tail classes, degrading pseudo-label quality.

Proposed Solution - Shared Feature Calibration (SFC):
- Maintain a class-specific image bank and uniformly sample images from it to complement each batch, increasing sampling frequency for tail classes.  
- Propose a multi-scaled distribution-weighted (MSDW) consistency loss between CAMs from classifier weights and prototypes to pull them closer. The loss is weighted by the sample number gap between classes.
- Combining classifier weight CAM and prototype CAM during inference further improves results.

Main Contributions:
- Identify issue of shared feature bias causing poor quality CAMs under long tail distribution.
- Propose novel SFC method to address this including image bank resampling and MSDW loss. 
- Achieve new state-of-the-art performance for WSSS on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets using only image labels.
- Provide detailed analysis on shared feature distributions and over/under-activation as well as workings of the proposed solutions.

The key novelty is identifying the shared feature bias issue in CAMs under long-tail distribution and proposing the calibration method with image bank resampling and consistency loss to alleviate this. The method achieves top results for WSSS using just image labels.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Shared Feature Calibration method to address the over-activation and under-activation issues in weakly supervised semantic segmentation caused by shared features among head and tail classes under a long-tailed training data distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work include:

1. It first points out that the features shared by head and tail classes can enlarge the classifier-weight-generated CAM for the head class and shrink it for the tail class under a long-tailed scenario. 

2. It proposes a Shared Feature Calibration (SFC) method for CAM generation aimed at balancing the shared feature proportions in different classifier weights, which can improve the CAM quality.

3. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on weakly supervised semantic segmentation with only image-level labels on Pascal VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 datasets.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the SFC method to calibrate shared features and improve CAMs for better weakly supervised semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results. The key ideas are identifying the over-/under-activation issue caused by shared features under long-tailed data and using techniques like distribution-weighted consistency loss to address it.
