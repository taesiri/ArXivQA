# [DSS: A Diverse Sample Selection Method to Preserve Knowledge in   Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09357)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in incremental learning (IL), where models forget previously learned knowledge when trained on new data. Specifically, it focuses on class-incremental learning (CIL) under both disjoint task boundaries, where classes do not repeat across tasks, and fuzzy task boundaries, where some class repetition occurs. The key challenge is to select representative "exemplar" samples from previous tasks to rehearse along with new data, in order to mitigate CF. Most exemplar selection methods do not ensure diversity of selected samples. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new exemplar selection technique called "DSS" (Diverse Sample Selection) based on k-center clustering. It first reduces data dimensionality using t-SNE, then iteratively selects exemplars furthest from already chosen ones, while also enforcing a minimum number of neighbors within a distance threshold to exclude outliers. The overall training uses both cross-entropy and distillation loss for incremental knowledge retention.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes DSS, a simple and efficient exemplar sampling technique that ensures diversity and is robust to outliers
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100 in both disjoint and fuzzy (classes repeating) CIL scenarios
- Provides a detailed algorithm and training procedure for DSS along with intuitions
- Conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DSS, including analyzing impact of key hyperparameter

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through a simple yet high-performing rehearsal-based approach to tackle catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning. The diversity-focused exemplar sampling technique is the key novelty leading to improved incremental knowledge retention.
