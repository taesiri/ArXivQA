# [Tightly-Coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial SLAM and Large-Scale Volumetric   Occupancy Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02280)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous navigation for mobile robots requires two key capabilities - accurate state estimation to localize the robot, and mapping the 3D environment into a consistent representation that can be used for planning and navigation. However, drift in state estimation over long trajectories can lead to inconsistent maps. The paper aims to address these dual challenges of robust state estimation and consistent mapping.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial SLAM system that leverages submapping to achieve both accurate state estimation and globally consistent maps. The key aspects are:

1) Visual-inertial odometry provides initial state estimates by optimizing a factor graph with visual reprojection errors, IMU preintegration factors and relative pose constraints. 

2) The state estimates are used to motion-compensate LiDAR scans into local submaps represented as voxel occupancy grids. New submaps are spawned based on overlap of LiDAR scans.

3) Novel Lidar factors are introduced between (a) current frame and last submap and (b) overlapping submaps. These factors directly operate on occupancy values and gradients, avoiding expensive data association.

4) The lidar factors are tightly integrated into the factor graph optimization to refine the state estimates, keeping the submaps globally consistent.

Main Contributions:

- A tightly-coupled optimization-based approach for LVI-SLAM and mapping enforcing global submap consistency

- Novel lidar residualsbetween frame-to-map and map-to-map leveraging occupancy and gradient queries without data correspondence search.

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy on HILTI benchmark while producing high quality globally consistent maps.

The system demonstrates versatility across different LiDAR sensors like mechanical spinning or solid-state sensors, indoor and outdoor environments, and various motion dynamics. Timing analysis shows real-time feasibility. Future work includes better uncertainty modeling and informed point cloud downsampling for further efficiency gains.
