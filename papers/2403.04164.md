# [ProMISe: Promptable Medical Image Segmentation using SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04164)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large foundation models like SAM for medical image segmentation is costly and risks instability, feature damage, and catastrophic forgetting. 
- Existing methods sacrifice SAM's interactivity and prompting capability.
- Using only ground truth-based prompts fails to enable SAM to achieve practical performance on medical images.

Proposed Solution:
- An Auto-Prompting Module (APM) to generate optimal prompts for SAM using its powerful feature extraction capabilities.
- A novel Incremental Pattern Shifting (IPS) method to non-invasively shift the mask decoder's patterns to the target medical domain, enabling state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning SAM.
- Couple APM and IPS into an end-to-end framework called ProMISe for promptable medical image segmentation using a completely frozen SAM model.

Main Contributions:
- APM leverages SAM's encoder to provide better prompts that significantly improve performance on medical images without training SAM.
- IPS efficiently shifts patterns by adding small IPS tokens, outperforming fine-tuning approaches. Achieves SOTA results with a frozen SAM.  
- ProMISe allows end-to-end tuning of APM and IPS for adaptive prompting and pattern shifting, enabling interpretable and interactive segmentation on medical images without any fine-tuning of SAM's parameters.
- First work to transfer SAM to medical images while keeping all of its parameters frozen, demonstrating possibilities beyond fine-tuning for foundation model usage.

In summary, the paper proposes novel prompt generation and pattern shifting methods to successfully apply the SAM model to medical image segmentation without needing to fine-tune SAM, overcoming major challenges faced by prior work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called ProMISe that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical image segmentation without fine-tuning, using an Auto-Prompting Module for generating adaptive prompts and an Incremental Pattern Shifting method to shift the prior pattern knowledge of SAM's mask decoder.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an Auto-Prompting Module (APM) to generate adaptive prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in the target medical image domain. This improves SAM's performance without fine-tuning. 

2. Proposing an Incremental Pattern Shifting (IPS) method to shift the prior pattern knowledge of SAM's mask decoder to adapt it to medical images. This enables SAM to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance in medical image segmentation without any fine-tuning.

3. Coupling APM and IPS into an end-to-end framework called ProMISe (Promptable Medical Image Segmentation) to realize prompt-based pattern shifting to adapt SAM to medical images. All of SAM's parameters are kept frozen in this framework.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing methods to successfully transfer the large general purpose SAM model to medical image segmentation in a non-invasive and low-cost way, while retaining its interactivity. The methods also enable SAM to achieve excellent performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- SAM (Segment Anything Model): The recently proposed foundation model for natural image segmentation that the authors aim to transfer to medical image segmentation.

- ProMISe (Promptable Medical Image Segmentation): The proposed end-to-end non-fine-tuned framework for prompt-based medical image segmentation utilizing SAM.  

- APM (Auto-Prompting Module): The proposed lightweight module that provides adaptive Euclidean prompts for SAM using the image features.

- IPS (Incremental Pattern Shifting): The proposed efficient and non-invasive pattern shifting method to adapt the mask decoder of SAM to medical domains.  

- Pattern shifting/transfer: The core idea of transferring the mask prediction patterns of SAM from natural to medical images.

- Foundation model: The perspective of viewing SAM as a foundation model with robust capabilities even in unseen domains, rather than just a heavily pre-trained model.

- Non-invasive: Key property of the proposed methods that keep all SAM parameters frozen, avoiding risks like instability and catastrophic forgetting.

- Spatial prompts: Such as points and boxes, that provide spatial guidance to interactively segment targets in SAM.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around efficiently transferring and adapting SAM to medical image segmentation in a non-invasive way while retaining its interactivity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an Auto-Prompting Module (APM) to generate adaptive prompts for SAM. What is the motivation behind using an APM rather than just using ground truth prompts? How does the APM architecture utilize multi-level features from SAM's image encoder?

2. The Incremental Pattern Shifting (IPS) method is proposed to shift the prior pattern knowledge of SAM's mask decoder. Explain the key idea behind using output tokens for pattern shifting. How does the IPS module utilize the mask tokens and image embeddings? 

3. The paper couples the APM and IPS modules into the ProMISe framework. What is the advantage of using adaptive prompts over ground truth prompts for end-to-end pattern shifting? Does ProMISe retain SAM's interpretability?

4. Analyze the differences in performance improvements from using APM versus IPS. Why does increasing the number of point prompts lead to significant gains when using IPS but not necessarily with just APM?

5. Compare and contrast the IPS method with other SAM fine-tuning strategies. What are some risks mitigated by keeping all of SAM's parameters frozen? How does this help utilize SAM as a foundation model?

6. Why is the PaE module indispensable for the IPS method to achieve state-of-the-art results? What is the tradeoff in performance versus model complexity when removing the PaE module?

7. The paper demonstrates SOTA performance on several medical image datasets. Analyze the generalization capability added by the IPS module across different modalities like endoscopy and dermoscopy. 

8. Discuss the potential limitations of the ProMISe framework. Would further improvements be possible by incorporating textual prompts? How about other spatial prompt types?

9. Compare qualitative segmentation mask outputs with and without IPS. What specific improvements are enabled by the pattern shifting? How does this address limitations of SAM and SAM-Med2D?

10. The proposed methods keep all SAM parameters frozen. Discuss how this differs from the conventional wisdom of fine-tuning for transfer learning. What are other potential use cases where fixed foundations models can be efficiently adapted?
