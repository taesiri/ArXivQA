# [ProMISe: Promptable Medical Image Segmentation using SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04164)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large foundation models like SAM for medical image segmentation is costly and risks instability, feature damage, and catastrophic forgetting. 
- Existing methods sacrifice SAM's interactivity and prompting capability.
- Using only ground truth-based prompts fails to enable SAM to achieve practical performance on medical images.

Proposed Solution:
- An Auto-Prompting Module (APM) to generate optimal prompts for SAM using its powerful feature extraction capabilities.
- A novel Incremental Pattern Shifting (IPS) method to non-invasively shift the mask decoder's patterns to the target medical domain, enabling state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning SAM.
- Couple APM and IPS into an end-to-end framework called ProMISe for promptable medical image segmentation using a completely frozen SAM model.

Main Contributions:
- APM leverages SAM's encoder to provide better prompts that significantly improve performance on medical images without training SAM.
- IPS efficiently shifts patterns by adding small IPS tokens, outperforming fine-tuning approaches. Achieves SOTA results with a frozen SAM.  
- ProMISe allows end-to-end tuning of APM and IPS for adaptive prompting and pattern shifting, enabling interpretable and interactive segmentation on medical images without any fine-tuning of SAM's parameters.
- First work to transfer SAM to medical images while keeping all of its parameters frozen, demonstrating possibilities beyond fine-tuning for foundation model usage.

In summary, the paper proposes novel prompt generation and pattern shifting methods to successfully apply the SAM model to medical image segmentation without needing to fine-tune SAM, overcoming major challenges faced by prior work.
