# [Application-Agnostic Language Modeling for On-Device ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09764)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we build a single neural network language model (NNLM) that serves both a virtual assistant (VA) application and a speech-to-text (STT) application equally well, while reducing model size compared to separate application-specific models?

The key points are:

- The paper aims to build a single NNLM that can serve two speech applications: a virtual assistant and speech-to-text. 

- Typically, separate application-specific models would be built for each application. However, this increases model size. 

- The goal is to build a single model that maintains the accuracy of the separate models, while reducing the overall model size.

- The paper explores both data-driven and model architecture approaches to build this unified application-agnostic model.

So in summary, the main research contribution is developing methods to train a single on-device NNLM that serves multiple applications as accurately as individual models but with a reduced memory footprint.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The key contributions of this paper are:

1. A method to optimally combine application-specific data sources to train an application-agnostic language model that can serve multiple applications (virtual assistant and speech-to-text). This involves creating a balanced dev set and determining sampling weights for the data sources.

2. Two novel feedforward neural network language model architectures based on Fixed-size Ordinally-Forgetting Encoding (FOFE) that can effectively serve multiple applications in an on-device automatic speech recognition system:

- Application-Dependent (AD) FOFE NNLM which has separate sub-networks for each application that are selectively used at train/test time.

- Mixture FOFE NNLM composed of an ensemble of parallel FOFE sub-networks whose outputs are combined via learned mixture weights.

3. Experiments on 3 languages (English, German, Mandarin) showing that both proposed models can match/outperform application-specific models in accuracy while reducing disk size by ~50%. The AD-FOFE also matches/outperforms them in speed.

4. Comparisons to transformer NNLM showing transformer does not consistently outperform FOFE models likely due to short context length in ASR.

In summary, the key idea is using data balancing and novel feedforward NNLM architectures to effectively serve multiple applications in on-device ASR under tight efficiency constraints. The AD-FOFE model in particular provides gains in accuracy, speed and disk size.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes two novel feed-forward neural network language model architectures - an Application-Dependent FOFE and an Application-Agnostic Mixture FOFE - that are able to match the accuracy of application-specific models while reducing disk size by half, for an on-device automatic speech recognition system serving both a virtual assistant and speech-to-text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in application-agnostic language modeling:

- The paper focuses specifically on building a single neural network language model (NNLM) that can serve both a virtual assistant (VA) application and a speech-to-text (STT) application. Most prior work has focused on either building models for a single application or combining models after the fact. Looking at combined training is novel.

- The data balancing method proposed to combine application-specific data sources is simple but logical. It finds sampling weights based on the importance of each data source for both applications. Many papers have looked at techniques like over/under-sampling and curriculum learning for balancing data, but less work has specifically addressed balancing distinct applications.

- The two model architectures explored, the mixture FOFE NNLM and application-dependent FOFE NNLM, are novel extensions of the standard FOFE feedforward NNLM. Using parallel sub-networks and multi-task learning to differentiate applications is an intuitive approach. These models outperform baseline Feedforward and Transformer models.

- The paper tests the methods on 3 languages, while most similar work focuses only on English. Evaluating on multiple test sets per language with different characteristics is also thorough.

- The focus on accuracy, speed, and model size makes the work well-suited to on-device applications. Much language modeling research focuses only on accuracy, while this considers the full deployment context.

Overall, the paper makes nice contributions in terms of the data balancing method, model architectures, multi-lingual experiments, and focus on constraints relevant to on-device ASR. The techniques could generalize well to combining other distinct applications in language modeling.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Test the proposed models (AD FOFE and AA FOFE Mixture) on more languages beyond just English, German and Mandarin Chinese. The comparison with Transformer models was not done for every language, so more extensive experimentation is needed.

- Explore subword-level language models in addition to the word-level LMs investigated in this work. The authors mention having done some preliminary experiments with subword LMs but more investigation is required.

- Look into other novel neural network architectures that could help build a single application-agnostic model. The focus was on FOFE-based architectures here, but there may be other types of architectures worth exploring as well.

- Try combining the proposed data sampling method with other neural LM architectures besides FOFE networks. The data balancing scheme may also be beneficial when training Transformers or other types of NNLMs.

- Investigate whether the findings generalize to other types of on-device applications beyond just virtual assistants and speech-to-text. The techniques may be applicable to other domains too.

- Explore other methods for optimally combining training data from different applications beyond just the count merging approach used in this work.

- Look at personalization techniques to see if user-specific models can be built efficiently while still remaining application-agnostic.

So in summary, the authors recommend further exploration around novel neural architectures, alternate training schemes, additional applications, more languages, and personalized models as fruitful research directions following this work. The core ideas seem promising but more experimentation is needed.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents approaches for application-agnostic language modeling to serve both virtual assistant and speech-to-text requests in on-device automatic speech recognition systems. The challenges are meeting accuracy, speed and size constraints while handling different data distributions across applications. They propose a data balancing method to combine training data and two novel feedforward neural network architectures: 1) An application-dependent model with separate subnetworks for each application and 2) A mixture model ensemble with weights controlled by a separate mixture subnetwork. Experiments on English, German and Mandarin show these models match or exceed the accuracy of application-specific models while reducing model size. The application-dependent model also has faster inference speed. The key contributions are the data balancing scheme, novel neural network architectures, and empirical comparisons showing they meet on-device constraints across multiple languages.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes methods for building a single neural network language model (NNLM) that can serve multiple applications in on-device automatic speech recognition (ASR) with low latency and memory requirements. The two main applications are a virtual assistant (VA) and speech-to-text (STT). The paper first presents a data-driven approach to balance training data from different sources to create an application-agnostic dataset. Then two novel feedforward NNLM architectures are introduced: 1) A mixture model with parallel subnetworks for each application that are combined using learned mixture weights. 2) An application-dependent model with separate subnetworks for each application that are selectively activated during training and inference based on the application. Experiments on English, German and Mandarin show these architectures match or exceed the accuracy of separate application-specific models while reducing the disk footprint by half. The application-dependent model also has faster inference speed than the baseline and mixture models. In summary, the methods successfully build a single on-device NNLM serving multiple applications with optimized accuracy, speed and size.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores different neural network language modeling approaches to build a single application-agnostic model that can serve both a virtual assistant and speech-to-text application. The authors first use count merging to determine optimal sampling weights to balance the training data from the two different applications. They then propose two novel feedforward neural network architectures based on Fixed-size Ordinally-Forgetting Encoding (FOFE) to better model the different applications: 1) A mixture FOFE model with parallel subnetworks and a mixture component to compute weights across subnetworks. 2) An application-dependent FOFE model with separate subnetworks for each application that are selectively activated during training and inference based on the application type. Both proposed models are evaluated on three languages and compared to baseline FOFE and Transformer models in terms of accuracy, speed and model size. The application-dependent FOFE model is found to provide the best tradeoff, matching baseline accuracy and speed while reducing model size.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points from my reading of the paper are:

- The paper is addressing the challenges of developing an on-device automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve multiple applications well, while meeting constraints on accuracy, speed, and memory/disk usage. 

- Specifically, the ASR system they are working on needs to handle both virtual assistant (VA) requests and speech-to-text (STT) dictation. These two applications have very different data distributions and language patterns.

- The standard solution of training separate application-specific models increases memory usage, which is problematic for on-device ASR. So they want to develop a single application-agnostic model instead.

- They propose methods to optimally balance the training data from the two applications. 

- They also propose two novel feed-forward neural network language model architectures based on Fixed-size Ordinally-Forgetting Encoding (FOFE) that aim to serve both applications well:
  - A Mixture FOFE model with parallel sub-networks 
  - An Application-Dependent FOFE model with separate sub-networks for each application

- Experiments on English, German and Mandarin show these new models can match or exceed the accuracy of application-specific models, while reducing disk usage and maintaining speed.

In summary, the key focus is developing a single on-device ASR language model that works well for multiple applications with different data distributions, within accuracy, speed and memory constraints. The proposed methods aim to balance the data and model architecture to achieve this.
