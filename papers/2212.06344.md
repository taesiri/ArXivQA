# [DA Wand: Distortion-Aware Selection using Neural Mesh Parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06344)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform interactive, local mesh segmentation to obtain a region that can be parameterized with low distortion. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- A novel differentiable parameterization layer that enables unsupervised training to optimize segmentations for low distortion UV maps. This layer implements a weighted version of LSCM parameterization that smoothly approximates the LSCM result.

- Objectives and losses to encourage large, contiguous, low-distortion segmentations during unsupervised training. This includes a thresholded distortion loss and a compactness prior.

- A dataset of synthetic shapes with ground truth near-developable segmentations, to pretrain the segmentation network.

- A system that takes a mesh and user-selected point, and predicts a segmentation around that point that produces a large, low-distortion UV map. This could be useful for interactive workflows like texturing or decaling.

The main novelty is using the differentiable parameterization layer to enable unsupervised training to optimize for distortion, circumventing the lack of datasets with ground truth parameterization-aware segmentations. The network is trained to leverage both local and global information to produce segmentations that extend beyond immediate region around the selection point if doing so induces minimal distortion gain.
