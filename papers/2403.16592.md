# [TrustAI at SemEval-2024 Task 8: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multi-domain   Machine Generated Text Detection Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) allow them to generate highly fluent text across various domains. However, this raises concerns of misinformation, fake news, plagiarism, biases, and security/privacy issues.  
- Detecting machine-generated text is challenging as it can be very similar to human-written text in terms of fluency, coherence and real-world knowledge.

Tasks
- The competition consists of 3 subtasks:
   - Subtask A: Classify text as human-written or machine-generated, in both mono-lingual (English) and multi-lingual contexts
   - Subtask B: Classify text into 6 classes - 'human', 'chatGPT', 'cohere', 'davinci', 'bloomz', 'dolly' 

Proposed Solutions
- The authors comprehensively analyze various techniques:
   - Statistical models: Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, LightGBM, ensemble models
   - Neural models: CNN, RNN, LSTM
   - Pre-trained transformers: BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa
- Ensemble model using Naive Bayes, SGDClassifier and LightGBM obtains 86.9% accuracy on Subtask A mono test set
- RoBERTa model fine-tuned on machine-generated text achieves 83.7% on Subtask B test set  

Key Contributions
- First comprehensive analysis of machine-generated text detection methods for multi-domain mono/multi-lingual data
- Detailed experimental framework to evaluate statistical, neural and pre-trained models
- In-depth error analysis providing insights into model generalization
- Discussion of key challenges and recommendations for future work
