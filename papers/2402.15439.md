# [Charting Ethical Tensions in Multispecies Technology Research through   Beneficiary-Epistemology Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conducting ethical research involving animals and humans poses complex challenges, especially for interdisciplinary fields like human-computer interaction (HCI) and animal-computer interaction (ACI). There has been little prior reflection on ethical review processes within HCI.

- The paper reflects on the 18-month ethical review process for an artist-led HCI/ACI project called "Cat Royale". This was an artwork where a robot played with a family of three cats in an enclosure to explore public trust in autonomous systems and consider benefits for companion cats. 

- Gaining approval required dialogue with three institutional review boards (IRBs) covering computer science, veterinary science and animal welfare. This surfaced tensions concerning: cat welfare, perceived benefits/methods, and reputational risks.

Solution:  
- The authors introduce a "beneficiary-epistemology space" framework to reveal disciplinary assumptions and tensions in multi-disciplinary ethical review. 

- One axis covers intended beneficiaries - humans and/or animals. The other covers epistemological stances from positivism to interpretivism that shape views on valid methods and knowledge.

- Mapping a project and IRBs in this space reveals mismatches in expected beneficiaries and epistemological assumptions that underlie ethical tensions.

Contributions:
- Provides a rare insight into the "hidden work" of negotiating ethical review in HCI/ACI.

- Introduces the beneficiary-epistemology framework to uncover disciplinary tensions between projects and IRBs.

- Makes recommendations to improve future ethical review processes, including: explicit ethical framing by projects, recruiting expertise onto advisory panels, establishing dedicated HCI/ACI ethical boards.

- Has wider implications for interdisciplinary HCI research appropriating methods from other fields.
