# [Charting Ethical Tensions in Multispecies Technology Research through   Beneficiary-Epistemology Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conducting ethical research involving animals and humans poses complex challenges, especially for interdisciplinary fields like human-computer interaction (HCI) and animal-computer interaction (ACI). There has been little prior reflection on ethical review processes within HCI.

- The paper reflects on the 18-month ethical review process for an artist-led HCI/ACI project called "Cat Royale". This was an artwork where a robot played with a family of three cats in an enclosure to explore public trust in autonomous systems and consider benefits for companion cats. 

- Gaining approval required dialogue with three institutional review boards (IRBs) covering computer science, veterinary science and animal welfare. This surfaced tensions concerning: cat welfare, perceived benefits/methods, and reputational risks.

Solution:  
- The authors introduce a "beneficiary-epistemology space" framework to reveal disciplinary assumptions and tensions in multi-disciplinary ethical review. 

- One axis covers intended beneficiaries - humans and/or animals. The other covers epistemological stances from positivism to interpretivism that shape views on valid methods and knowledge.

- Mapping a project and IRBs in this space reveals mismatches in expected beneficiaries and epistemological assumptions that underlie ethical tensions.

Contributions:
- Provides a rare insight into the "hidden work" of negotiating ethical review in HCI/ACI.

- Introduces the beneficiary-epistemology framework to uncover disciplinary tensions between projects and IRBs.

- Makes recommendations to improve future ethical review processes, including: explicit ethical framing by projects, recruiting expertise onto advisory panels, establishing dedicated HCI/ACI ethical boards.

- Has wider implications for interdisciplinary HCI research appropriating methods from other fields.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper reflects on an artist-led project involving a robot playing with cats that underwent complex ethical review, proposes a framework called beneficiary-epistemology space to reveal tensions between disciplines with different views on research beneficiaries and validity, and suggests strategies to improve future multidisciplinary ethical review processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the "beneficiary-epistemology space" framework. Specifically:

The paper reflects on the complex ethical review process that the Cat Royale project had to navigate, involving approval from three different institutional review boards (IRBs) with different perspectives. 

To make sense of the tensions that emerged between the project and the IRBs, the authors propose the "beneficiary-epistemology space" framework. This framework has two dimensions:

1) Beneficiaries - Who benefits from the research (humans, animals, etc.)

2) Epistemology - The underlying beliefs about what constitutes valid knowledge and methods (e.g. positivism vs interpretivism)

The framework allows projects and IRBs to be positioned based on these two dimensions. This reveals underlying tensions that need to be negotiated for ethical approval of complex interdisciplinary and multispecies projects. 

The paper suggests this framework can be useful for:

- Helping projects explicitly position themselves and anticipate tensions during ethical review
- Informing the expertise needed on advisory panels 
- Guiding the formation of dedicated HCI-ACI ethical review boards

So in summary, the key contribution is the introduction and demonstration of the usefulness of the beneficiary-epistemology space for making sense of ethical tensions in complex interdisciplinary projects involving both humans and animals.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "beneficiary-epistemology space" framework to make explicit the disciplinary alignment of projects and institutional review boards. How exactly does this framework help reveal underlying tensions that need to be negotiated in the ethical review process? What are some limitations or challenges in practically applying this framework?

2. The paper discusses internal tensions within the Cat Royale project related to its ambiguous framing and multiple methods with conflicting ethical demands (performance art vs animal-centered design). How might researchers proactively identify and address such internal tensions in interdisciplinary projects during the design process? 

3. The authors argue that articulating benefits was more difficult than identifying harms during the ethical review process. Why might this be the case? How can researchers strengthen the case for benefits, especially for projects with non-traditional methods or aims?

4. What processes could facilitate ongoing dialogue between researchers and institutional review boards, as advocated in the paper? What challenges might arise in implementing these and how can they be addressed?  

5. The paper proposes recruiting additional domain experts in arts and humanities to advisory panels. What unique perspectives could they contribute regarding the ethics of ambiguous or provocative framings? How may aesthetic concerns differ from conventional research ethics considerations?

6. If dedicated HCI-ACI ethical review boards were to be established, what should be the criteria and process for selecting appropriate board members? What training may be necessary for members to develop competence in assessing diverse interdisciplinary methods?  

7. How can the proposed framework be extended to consider non-animal stakeholders like plants or the environment? What additional expert perspectives might need to be included? What other frameworks could complement it?

8. The paper focuses on institutional ethical review processes. How may ethical reflection continue through the lifetime of complex, iterative projects to address emerging challenges? What methods support this?  

9. The authors warn about the dangers of "research tourism" between disciplines. What good practices can promote mutually beneficial interdisciplinary collaboration while respecting disciplinary bounds and ethics standards?  

10. The paper notes reputational risks around public perception of animal involvement. How may researchers balance transparency and openness with managing risks to institutions and vulnerable communities like animals? What communication strategies help convey complexity?
