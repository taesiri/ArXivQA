# [Towards Implicit Prompt For Text-To-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks focus on evaluating models using explicit prompts that directly name the target object or concept. However, implicit prompts that describe targets without naming them are neglected.
- Implicit prompts have potential benefits in enabling more scalable generation, but also risks like privacy violations or generating unsafe content that current constraints may miss. 

Solution:
- The authors propose "ImplicitBench", a benchmark with over 2000 implicit prompts spanning three key aspects - General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy, and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues.
- They evaluate 6 major T2I models on generating images from these prompts and assess accuracy via automated evaluations and human judgement.

Key Findings:
- Models show decent accuracy on General Symbols but struggle with more abstract concepts like logos. Alignment to text and image quality impact success.  
- Alarming privacy risks exist as models can often generate recognizable celebrity images from descriptive prompts. Fame level also impacts accuracy.
- Most models fail to filter implicit NSFW prompts, generating porn, violent and other disturbing content. Certain word types like technical terms pose higher risks.  

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of major T2I models on interpreting and generating images from implicit text prompts.
- A large benchmark ImplicitBench focusing on key aspects - symbols, privacy and safety issues. 
- Evidence of promising capabilities but also serious concerns that require further research into model understanding of implicit concepts and more robust policy constraints.

In summary, this paper significantly expands the scope of T2I research to the relatively unexplored space of implicit prompts and provides both opportunities and pressing challenges regarding security, privacy and policy that call for greater attention from the research community.
