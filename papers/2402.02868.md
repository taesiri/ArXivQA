# [Fine-tuning Reinforcement Learning Models is Secretly a Forgetting   Mitigation Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Fine-tuning pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) models on new tasks remains challenging, limiting the transfer of capabilities compared to supervised learning. 
- The paper identifies a key issue - "forgetting of pre-trained capabilities" (FPC), where agents lose prior skills when fine-tuned on parts of the state space not seen during pre-training. This is caused by interference in the function approximator.
- FPC has two main instances - (1) state coverage gap, where pre-trained policy performs well on unseen states but not on seen states, and (2) imperfect cloning gap, where pre-trained policy is slightly suboptimal, leading to compounding errors.

Proposed Solution 
- Treat FPC as a continual learning problem and apply techniques like elastic weight consolidation (EWC), behavioral cloning (BC), kickstarting (KS) and episodic memory (EM) to mitigate forgetting.
- Show how these techniques allow efficient transfer from pre-trained models and unlock state-of-the-art results.

Experiments
- Test on Nethack, Montezuma's Revenge and robotic manipulation tasks.
- Vanilla fine-tuning fails in all cases. Adding knowledge retention boosts performance significantly.
- Analysis shows agents rapidly forget skills on unseen states with vanilla fine-tuning. Retention techniques alleviate this.
- On Nethack, achieve new SOTA for neural models (>10K points).

Key Contributions
- Identify and analyze forgetting of pre-trained capabilities (FPC) as a key bottleneck limiting transfer in RL fine-tuning. 
- Show forgetting mitigation techniques from continual learning allow unlocking transfer potential from pre-trained models.
- Set new SOTA for neural models on Nethack through fine-tuning an imitation learning agent with knowledge retention.

In summary, the paper makes a case for using continual learning techniques to mitigate forgetting of pre-trained skills during RL fine-tuning, which allows much more efficient transfer compared to vanilla fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary:

This paper finds that fine-tuning reinforcement learning models often suffers from catastrophic forgetting of capabilities on unvisited parts of the state space, and shows that knowledge retention techniques can mitigate this issue and unlock more effective transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper conceptualizes and provides empirical evidence for the problem of "forgetting of pre-trained capabilities" (FPC) in fine-tuning reinforcement learning models. Specifically, it identifies two common instances of this problem: the "state coverage gap" where the pre-trained model does not cover parts of the state space needed early in fine-tuning, and the "imperfect cloning gap" where the pre-trained model is not a perfect clone of the desired behavior. The paper shows these issues severely hinder transfer in several RL environments. Finally, it demonstrates that using common knowledge retention techniques from continual learning, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation, kickstarting, and replay buffers, can mitigate forgetting and unlock the full potential of transfer through fine-tuning in RL.

In summary, the key insight is that fine-tuning in RL should be viewed through the lens of mitigating catastrophic forgetting, contrary to the common wisdom from supervised learning. When addressed properly, much better transfer can be achieved as evidenced by state-of-the-art results on the NetHack environment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Fine-tuning - The paper focuses on fine-tuning of reinforcement learning models, specifically analyzing the challenges of transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a downstream task. 

- Forgetting of pre-trained capabilities (FPC) - This is the main problem identified in the paper, referring to how fine-tuned RL models can lose or forget abilities they previously had due to interference in the function approximator.

- State coverage gap - One specific instance of FPC where the pre-trained policy performs well on states not visited early in fine-tuning, butforgets that capability when training on the other states. 

- Imperfect cloning gap - Another instance of FPC stemming from discrepancies between the pre-trained and optimal policies, leading to imbalanced state visitation.

- Knowledge retention techniques - Methods such as elastic weight consolidation, replay, and distillation that are proposed to mitigate FPC during fine-tuning. 

- NetHack - A complex game environment used as one of the main experimental testbeds in the paper to analyze FPC.

So in summary, the key concepts cover the forgetting problem, specific scenarios where it manifests, and techniques to retain knowledge, examined mainly in complex game environments like NetHack.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes that forgetting of pre-trained capabilities (FPC) is a key issue limiting transfer from pre-trained models in RL. What evidence do the authors provide to support this claim? How does this relate to findings in supervised transfer learning?

2. The paper identifies two important instances of FPC - the environment shift gap and the imperfect cloning gap. Can you explain these concepts in your own words? What are some real-world scenarios where these issues would occur? 

3. Knowledge retention techniques are proposed to mitigate FPC. Outline the key methods discussed (EWC, BC, KS, EM) and explain how each one aims to alleviate forgetting. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each?

4. The experiments showcase FPC occurring in complex environments like NetHack, Montezuma's Revenge and robotic manipulation tasks. Pick one environment and analyze the pre-training scheme, conceptualization of "close" vs "far" states, and results showing FPC and its mitigation.  

5. The paper finds that behavioral cloning works best to mitigate the environment shift gap whereas kickstarting handles the imperfect cloning gap. What reasons are provided to explain this finding? Can you think of scenarios where the opposite would hold true?

6. Figure 5 shows a detailed analysis of FPC on specific NetHack levels. Choose one metric and critique the relative performance of different knowledge retention techniques. How could the approaches be improved?

7. The paper claims "standard fine-tuning does not exhibit positive transfer" in the robotic experiments. Do the results fully justify this conclusion? What analyses (Fig 7) support this claim? How might positive transfer still be occurring?

8. The CKA analysis tracks how neural network representations change during fine-tuning. Summarize the key findings. How do they enrich our understanding of how and where forgetting occurs? 

9. The paper explores FPC in different network architectures and task orderings. Outline 1-2 key findings from these analyses. Do they reveal any surprising results or new research questions?

10. The paper focuses solely on maximizing downstream performance, not retaining source task capabilities. Discuss the limitations of this viewpoint. How might a continual RL perspective enrich the analysis and results?
