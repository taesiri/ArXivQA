# [Hoyer regularizer is all you need for ultra low-latency spiking neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10170)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train accurate and sparse spiking neural networks (SNNs) that require only a single time step, to enable ultra low-latency inference?Specifically, the paper proposes a novel training framework to train one-time-step SNN models from scratch that can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on image classification tasks. The key ideas are:1) Using a variant of the Hoyer regularizer in the loss function to induce sparsity in the SNN membrane potentials during training. 2) Proposing a new Hoyer spike layer where the threshold is set dynamically based on the Hoyer extremum of the membrane potentials, which helps generate more spikes for weight update during backpropagation.3) Making architectural modifications like adding batch normalization to existing SNN models like VGG and ResNet to make them more optimized for one-time-step training.The central hypothesis is that this proposed training framework of Hoyer regularization, Hoyer spike layer, and network architecture search can enable training accurate and sparse SNN models with just one-time step, overcoming the limitations of prior work that required multiple time steps. Reducing time steps to one lowers latency and improves efficiency.The paper evaluates this hypothesis by training SNN models on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. The results show high accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art SNNs but with up to 32x lower latency, validating the core hypothesis. Comparisons to non-spiking networks also demonstrate accuracy improvements over binary and adder networks.In summary, the paper introduces a novel training technique to optimize one-step SNNs to achieve compelling accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for low latency inference. The core innovation is using Hoyer regularization and spike layers to enable effective single time step training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a training framework to train accurate and sparse spiking neural networks (SNNs) with only one time step. The key ideas are:- Using a novel Hoyer spike layer that sets the spiking threshold based on the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of the membrane potential tensor. This helps reduce the threshold and increase spiking activity to enable training convergence with one time step. - Using a Hoyer regularizer in the loss function that pushes the membrane potential distribution away from the Hoyer extremum threshold. This reduces the impact of noise for improved training.- Modified network architectures like adding batch normalization after pooling in VGG, and extra shortcuts in ResNet to make the models more suitable for one-step training.- Achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to prior one-time-step SNNs on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, with significantly lower training time. The models are also more energy-efficient than multi-timestep SNNs and achieve better accuracy-compute tradeoffs than binary/adder networks.In summary, the paper enables training accurate and sparse SNNs with just one timestep, overcoming a key limitation of prior multi-timestep SNN training techniques. This allows faster and more efficient deployment of SNNs in low-latency applications.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel training framework for ultra low-latency spiking neural networks (SNNs) that require only one time step during inference. The key contributions include:- A new Hoyer spike layer that uses the Hoyer extremum of a clipped membrane potential tensor to dynamically downscale the spiking threshold. This helps increase spike rates to enable training convergence with just one time step. - A Hoyer regularizer added to the training loss that helps shift the membrane potential distribution away from the spiking threshold. This reduces the impact of noise for improved accuracy.- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art accuracy compared to prior one time step SNNs on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets using VGG and ResNet architectures. The proposed approach also outperforms binary and adder neural networks in terms of accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs.Compared to prior work on low-latency SNNs, this paper uniquely achieves one time step operation without any pre-training, conversion from ANNs, or iterative training. Most prior SNNs require multiple time steps for encoding inputs or accumulating evidence, which increases latency, memory traffic, and power consumption.The proposed Hoyer techniques enable training convergence and noise resilience with just one step. This matches the efficiency of binary or adder nets that also avoid costly multiply-accumulates, while achieving higher accuracy.Overall, this work pushes the boundaries of ultra low-latency neural network design. It demonstrates that by co-optimizing custom neuron behaviors and regularization, SNNs can operate in a purely feedforward fashion without accuracy loss versus ANNs or prior SNNs. This could enable new applications demanding high throughput and power efficiency.

For example, how the threshold adapts over training compared to prior techniques.- Reducing the gap in accuracy compared to non-spiking neural networks. There is still a 5-7% mAP drop on object detection tasks compared to standard CNNs.- Optimizing hardware and systems to efficiently implement the sparse operations and leverage the low precision weights.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a training framework to enable accurate and low-latency spiking neural networks (SNNs) that operate with just one time step. The framework uses a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer to induce sparsity in the membrane potentials and shift their distribution away from the spiking threshold. It also proposes a Hoyer spike layer where the spiking threshold is set dynamically based on the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of the membrane potential tensor, with the clipping threshold trained via gradient descent and the Hoyer regularizer. This allows more spikes to be generated to sufficiently update the weights with just one time step, while also reducing the impact of noise on the threshold. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy compared to prior one time step SNNs on CIFAR and ImageNet classification, with 5.5x lower compute cost than binary neural networks. The approach also shows strong performance on downstream object detection tasks. Overall, the proposed framework enables fast and accurate one time step SNNs that can be deployed on low-power devices.
