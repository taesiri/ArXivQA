# [Hoyer regularizer is all you need for ultra low-latency spiking neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10170)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train accurate and sparse spiking neural networks (SNNs) that require only a single time step, to enable ultra low-latency inference?Specifically, the paper proposes a novel training framework to train one-time-step SNN models from scratch that can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on image classification tasks. The key ideas are:1) Using a variant of the Hoyer regularizer in the loss function to induce sparsity in the SNN membrane potentials during training. 2) Proposing a new Hoyer spike layer where the threshold is set dynamically based on the Hoyer extremum of the membrane potentials, which helps generate more spikes for weight update during backpropagation.3) Making architectural modifications like adding batch normalization to existing SNN models like VGG and ResNet to make them more optimized for one-time-step training.The central hypothesis is that this proposed training framework of Hoyer regularization, Hoyer spike layer, and network architecture search can enable training accurate and sparse SNN models with just one-time step, overcoming the limitations of prior work that required multiple time steps. Reducing time steps to one lowers latency and improves efficiency.The paper evaluates this hypothesis by training SNN models on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. The results show high accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art SNNs but with up to 32x lower latency, validating the core hypothesis. Comparisons to non-spiking networks also demonstrate accuracy improvements over binary and adder networks.In summary, the paper introduces a novel training technique to optimize one-step SNNs to achieve compelling accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for low latency inference. The core innovation is using Hoyer regularization and spike layers to enable effective single time step training.
