# [Charting the Future of AI in Project-Based Learning: A Co-Design   Exploration with Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14915)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the advancement of AI, especially generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT, students are increasingly using AI to assist with learning tasks in project-based learning (PBL). This raises challenges for assessing students' learning outcomes, as it becomes difficult to evaluate the extent to which the project outcomes reflect the students' skills versus the capabilities of AI. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a co-design study with 18 college students to explore utilizing students' AI usage data to understand and assess their learning in PBL. In a workshop, students speculated future scenarios of AI-assisted PBL, identified impacts of AI on assessment goals, and designed analysis methods and reports of their AI usage that can capture relevant behaviors and thought processes.

Key Findings:
- Students desire to use AI for automating repetitive tasks, stimulating creative thinking, selecting best ideas, directly generating solutions, providing feedback, and even replacing instructor guidance.
- Students believe future assessments should evaluate efficacy in using AI, leadership over AI, human-AI symbiotic learning, and discernment when incorporating AI suggestions.
- Students suggested analyzing aspects like differentiation of human vs. AI tasks, quantification of AI's contribution, effectiveness of student-AI interaction, and the decision-making process regarding AI's outputs.
- Students' perceived AI roles (as a tool, teammate or expert) significantly impact their preferences in using and analyzing AI.
- Students raised fairness and truthfulness concerns regarding the evaluation based on AI interaction data.

Main Contributions:  
- Revealed future AI usage scenarios, shifts in educational goals, and analysis ideas grounded in students' perspectives.
- Identified nuances in students' AI interaction, such as their distinct beliefs about AI's role.  
- Opened discussions on responsibilities when analyzing students' AI usage and introduced research opportunities regarding student-AI interaction and learning analytics.
- Provided first steps towards understanding and assessing AI-enhanced PBL to inform the design of relevant instruction, tools and policies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes a co-design workshop method involving speculative design. What are the benefits of using this approach compared to other qualitative methods like interviews or surveys? How does it allow the researchers to deeply explore the complex interplay between students, AI, and assessments?

2. The workshop activities move from speculative AI usage scenarios to assessment transformations and finally to AI usage report designs. What is the rationale behind this progression of activities? How does each activity build on the insights from prior ones?  

3. The researchers chose to only include students in the workshops and not instructors. What might be some limitations of only examining the student perspective? In what ways could including instructors provide additional or alternative insights?

4. The paper argues the co-design method allows eliciting more concrete and grounded speculations from students compared to traditional design fiction approaches. What specifically did the researchers change in their approach compared to typical design fiction studies? How did this affect the outcomes?

5. The researchers utilized member checking after the workshops to validate findings. What value does member checking add compared to only analyzing the workshop data? What changes did the researchers make to their analysis based on member checking feedback?

6. The paper reveals interesting differences in how students with different beliefs regarding AI's role analyze AI usage data. What theories from fields like education, psychology or philosophy might provide explanations for these differential perspectives?  

7. Several analysis frameworks suggest examining the iterative process between students and AI. What specifically can such analysis reveal about students' learning and higher order thinking that other analyses may miss? What challenges might arise in capturing and visualizing this iterative process?

8. If the researchers were to extend this study using a quantitative approach, what specific hypotheses might they form and test based on the qualitative findings? What benefits would quantitative validation provide?

9. The paper argues even powerful AI cannot fully replace instructor roles in PBL. What specific instructor responsibilities seem most challenging for AI to replicate? Why might student-AI interaction never be able to substitute student-instructor communication? 

10. The paper identifies ethical risks of over-reliance on AI in PBL. What theories of ethics might better articulate these risks? How might we safeguard against ethical pitfalls as AI becomes increasingly entwined with education?
