## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Orca-2, a 13 billion parameter language model developed by Microsoft Research. Orca-2 aims to teach smaller language models advanced reasoning skills by exposing them to demonstrations of reasoning techniques from more capable teacher models. The key ideas are teaching models multiple reasoning strategies like step-by-step explanations or direct answers, helping models determine the most suitable strategy per task, and training using synthetic data from the teacher models while erasing the detailed prompts used to elicit the reasoning. This "cautious reasoning" approach allows models like the 7B and 13B parameter Orca-2 to significantly outperform similarly sized models and rival much larger 70B+ parameter models on complex reasoning tasks. The paper evaluates Orca-2 on 15 diverse benchmarks covering language, reasoning, common sense, summarization, and safety. Results show Orca-2 surpassing other 13B models by over 25% on average and equalling 70B models, highlighting its advanced reasoning skills. Limitations are the reliance on synthetic data and the teacher model's capabilities. Overall, the work demonstrates effective techniques to teach small models to reason, paving the way for new deployable AI applications.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new AI system called Orca 2 that aims to teach smaller language models advanced reasoning abilities. Orca 2 continues the work from the previous Orca 1 system which utilized explanation tuning to train models on rich reasoning signals from large teacher models like GPT-4. The key objectives of Orca 2 are: (1) Teach smaller models various reasoning techniques like step-by-step, recall-generate, recall-reason-generate, etc. (2) Help the models learn when to apply the most effective reasoning strategy based on the task. This ability is referred to as "cautious reasoning." 

To train Orca 2 models, intricate prompts are carefully designed to elicit strategic behaviors from teacher models. During training, the original prompts are erased in a technique called "prompt erasure", so models learn the underlying reasoning strategy rather than just imitating the teacher. Experiments are conducted on 15 diverse benchmarks covering approximately 100 tasks and 36,000 prompts. Results show Orca 2 significantly exceeds same-sized models and even outperforms much larger models on complex reasoning tasks. For instance, Orca 2 with just 13B parameters matches or surpasses models 5-10x its size on benchmarks like AGIEval, GSM8K, etc. Orca 2 represents promising progress in imparting stronger reasoning abilities to smaller neural networks. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and societal considerations around developing more capable AI systems.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we teach smaller language models to reason more effectively, allowing them to match or surpass much larger models on complex reasoning tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1. Smaller models can be taught a variety of reasoning techniques (e.g. step-by-step, recall-then-generate, recall-reason-generate, etc.) through training on tailored synthetic data. 

2. Smaller models can also learn when to apply the most suitable reasoning technique for a given task through this training process.

3. By teaching smaller models both how and when to reason in this way, their reasoning abilities can be significantly enhanced, allowing them to perform at levels comparable to much larger models on complex reasoning tasks requiring advanced skills like multi-step reasoning, even in zero-shot settings.

So in summary, the central research question is around developing the reasoning capacities of smaller models to match larger ones, with the key hypotheses focusing on using synthetic data to teach both reasoning techniques and reasoning strategy selection. The paper seems to aim to validate these hypotheses through the training and evaluation of the Orca-2 models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Introducing Orca-2, a new 13 billion parameter language model that is trained to reason carefully and strategically on a variety of tasks. 

2. Using a technique called "prompt erasing" during training to teach Orca-2 when and how to apply different reasoning strategies like step-by-step thinking, recall-then-generate, explain-then-answer etc. This helps Orca-2 learn to determine the most effective reasoning approach for each task.

3. Creating a new dataset of around 817K examples to train Orca-2 on how to reason. This data is generated strategically using a large language model (like GPT-4) to demonstrate good reasoning behaviors. 

4. Comprehensive evaluation of Orca-2 on 15 diverse benchmarks covering around 100 different tasks and over 36,000 prompts. The benchmarks test language understanding, reasoning, common sense, math, summarization etc.

5. Demonstrating that Orca-2 significantly outperforms models of similar size (7B-13B parameters) and attains performance competitive with or better than much larger models on complex reasoning tasks.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the introduction and evaluation of the Orca-2 model, which shows improved reasoning abilities compared to prior work by learning to strategically apply different reasoning techniques using the prompt erasing approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here are some comparisons of this paper to other related research:

- Research Approach: This paper takes an empirical approach by developing a new model called Orca-2 and evaluating it on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. Other related work has also developed new models, but evaluation tends to be on fewer or narrower sets of tasks. This paper stands out in its rigorous evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks.

- Model Architecture: Orca-2 builds on the LLaMA architecture and is trained with synthetic data generated by larger models like GPT-4. Other related work has also trained smaller models by distilling knowledge from larger models. However, Orca-2 focuses more on teaching reasoning strategies rather than just imitating outputs.

- Training Data: A key contribution is the generation of high-quality synthetic reasoning data using prompt engineering and task-specific strategies. Most prior work uses more generic instruction tuning datasets. The tailored data allows teaching nuanced reasoning skills.

- Reasoning Skills: This paper provides strong evidence that smaller models like Orca-2 can match or exceed much larger models in complex reasoning tasks when trained appropriately. Prior work has been more limited in rigorous evaluation of reasoning abilities.

- Model Scale: At 7B and 13B parameters, Orca-2 is smaller than many state-of-the-art models today. The results indicate potential for advanced reasoning in smaller models, whereas most research focuses on scaling model size.

- Safety and Ethics: The paper acknowledges limitations around safety, biases, transparency, and potential misuse. Most similar research does not discuss these issues in depth. Further investigation into the ethical use of synthetic data would be beneficial.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state of the art in training small models to reason. The combination of model architecture, training data, and evaluation rigor provides novel insights into the capabilities of smaller yet capable models. More work is still needed around transparency and ethics when leveraging large models to train small ones.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using prompt erasing during training to teach the model to determine the best solution strategy on its own. How might the model's performance differ if trained with the full prompts instead of erased prompts? Would it become too reliant on prompts and lose flexibility?

2. The paper emphasizes teaching the model multiple reasoning strategies like step-by-step, recall-then-generate, etc. How were these strategies identified? What criteria determined which strategies are most effective for different tasks? 

3. The paper generates tailored prompts to elicit desired reasoning behaviors from the teacher model. What techniques were used to create prompts that reliably produce high-quality reasoning? How were bad prompts that led to poor reasoning identified and improved?

4. The paper argues that smaller models should use different strategies than larger models given their capacity limitations. What mechanisms help the model determine when its capacity is exceeded and a simpler strategy is needed? How is the choice of strategy encoded during training?

5. How does the model identify the effectiveness of a particular strategy on a new task during inference? Does it have a way to dynamically try different strategies? Or does it rely solely onrecognizing task patterns from training?

6. The paper uses synthetic data to teach reasoning strategies. How might the distribution of training data impact which strategies the model learns to prefer? Could biases in the data lead to over-reliance on certain strategies?

7. The model is trained on carefully filtered synthetic demonstrations. How does this impact the model's knowledge and grounding compared to models trained on natural data? What mechanisms prevent ungrounding?

8. The paper argues against imitation learning as it may limit smaller models' potential. Does prompt erasing avoid the pitfalls of imitation learning? Could the model still suffer from blindly imitating strategies rather than developing its own?

9. How do the authors envision translating these methods to even smaller models (<1B parameters)? What adaptations would be needed as capacity decreases further?

10. The paper focuses on reasoning for natural language tasks. How might these methods transfer to reasoning in other domains like computer vision, robotics, mathematics, etc? Would the same strategies apply?
