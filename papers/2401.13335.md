# [Full Bayesian Significance Testing for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional significance testing methods have limitations in characterizing complex nonlinear relationships and only focus on testing global significance. 
- There is a need for methods that can test both global and local/instance-wise significance under nonlinear assumptions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel framework called "neural Full Bayesian Significance Testing" (nFBST) that introduces Bayesian neural networks into significance testing.
- Use Bayesian neural networks to fit the data distribution and avoid making strict assumptions about the form of the underlying true model. 
- Compute posterior distribution of the testing statistic rather than deriving its theoretical distribution.
- Test significance by comparing posterior probabilities of the null and alternative hypotheses.
- General framework that supports testing global, local or instance-wise significance using different test statistics.

Key Contributions:
- First work to introduce deep neural networks into significance testing to capture complex nonlinear relationships.
- nFBST framework that is flexible, extendable and can test significance at both global and local/instance levels.
- Avoids theoretical derivation of distribution of test statistics by using Bayesian neural networks to fit the distributions.
- Show advantages over classical methods and feature importance methods through experiments on simulated and real-world data.
- Mathematically prove that under certain constraints, the evidence for insignificant features converges to 1 as sample size increases.

In summary, the key innovation is using Bayesian neural networks to enable more flexible significance testing that works well in complex nonlinear settings and supports both global and local testing. The nFBST framework is general, extendable and shown to outperform existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel framework called neural Full Bayesian Significance Testing (\textit{n}FBST) that utilizes Bayesian neural networks to conduct significance testing for complex data relationships without needing to derive theoretical distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. It introduces deep neural networks into significance testing to capture nonlinear correlations between features and targets. This replaces complicated theoretical derivations with fitting distributions in a Bayesian way. 

2. It designs a complete procedure using Full Bayesian Significance Testing for Neural Networks (nFBST). nFBST is a general framework that can be extended based on different testing statistics, such as Grad-nFBST, LRP-nFBST, DeepLIFT-nFBST, LIME-nFBST, etc.

3. nFBST can solve both local and global significance testing problems while previous methods only focus on the latter. Under non-linear assumptions, global significance may be inconsistent with local or instance-wise significance. 

4. It conducts extensive experiments to verify the advantage of the proposed method in achieving better testing results on both simulated and real-world data.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a flexible and general framework nFBST for conducting significance testing on neural networks, which supports both global and local testing and can be easily extended based on different testing statistics. Experiments confirm its advantages.
