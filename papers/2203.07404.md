# [Respecting causality is all you need for training physics-informed   neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07404)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) be improved to better respect physical causality when solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs)? The key hypothesis is that explicitly accounting for the causal spatio-temporal structure inherent in the evolution of physical systems will enhance the accuracy and robustness of PINNs, allowing them to tackle more complex problems exhibiting chaotic or turbulent behavior. Specifically, the paper investigates an implicit bias in standard PINN formulations that leads them to violate physical causality, such as by minimizing PDE residuals at later times before resolving initial conditions. To address this, the authors propose a novel "causal training" algorithm that reweights the PINNs loss functions to respect causality and introduce a criterion for assessing training convergence. Through numerous benchmark examples, including chaotic systems like the Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, the paper demonstrates that this causal training approach alone enables significant accuracy improvements and allows PINNs to solve problems that were previously intractable. The central hypothesis is that properly accounting for physical causality is key to advancing PINNs' applicability to real-world scenarios.In summary, the paper aims to enhance PINNs by reformulating their training to better respect the causal structure governing time-dependent physical systems. The results strongly highlight the importance of causality for improving PINNs' simulation capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:1. Identifying an implicit bias in conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that can cause them to violate physical causality when trained to solve time-dependent PDEs. Specifically, they show PINNs are prone to first minimize PDE residuals at later times before fitting initial data. 2. Proposing a novel "causal training" algorithm to restore physical causality during PINNs training. This involves re-weighting the PDE residual loss at each iteration to ensure residuals are first minimized at earlier times before later ones.3. Demonstrating their causal training approach enables PINNs to achieve significantly higher accuracy (10-100x lower error) compared to prior methods on challenging benchmark problems including chaotic systems like Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations.4. Providing a practical quantitative criterion for assessing PINNs training convergence based on the magnitude of the residual weights in their proposed causal training algorithm.5. Showing state-of-the-art PINNs results on turbulent flow simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations, which has remained elusive for PINNs until now.In summary, the key novelty of this work seems to be identifying and addressing an inherent violation of physical causality in standard PINNs training, and demonstrating how resolving this issue through their causal training approach enables tackling challenging problems that were previously inaccessible to PINNs. The proposed ideas appear simple yet effective.
