# [Respecting causality is all you need for training physics-informed   neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07404)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) be improved to better respect physical causality when solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs)? The key hypothesis is that explicitly accounting for the causal spatio-temporal structure inherent in the evolution of physical systems will enhance the accuracy and robustness of PINNs, allowing them to tackle more complex problems exhibiting chaotic or turbulent behavior. Specifically, the paper investigates an implicit bias in standard PINN formulations that leads them to violate physical causality, such as by minimizing PDE residuals at later times before resolving initial conditions. To address this, the authors propose a novel "causal training" algorithm that reweights the PINNs loss functions to respect causality and introduce a criterion for assessing training convergence. Through numerous benchmark examples, including chaotic systems like the Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, the paper demonstrates that this causal training approach alone enables significant accuracy improvements and allows PINNs to solve problems that were previously intractable. The central hypothesis is that properly accounting for physical causality is key to advancing PINNs' applicability to real-world scenarios.In summary, the paper aims to enhance PINNs by reformulating their training to better respect the causal structure governing time-dependent physical systems. The results strongly highlight the importance of causality for improving PINNs' simulation capabilities.
