# [Fast and Knowledge-Free Deep Learning for General Game Playing (Student   Abstract)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- General game playing (GGP) aims to develop autonomous game playing agents that can play any game given just the rules, without human intervention. However, existing deep reinforcement learning approaches like AlphaZero require manual configuration and game-specific knowledge about action spaces and board topology to work effectively. This goes against the principles of pure GGP.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes adaptations to the AlphaZero model to make it more suitable for GGP:
  - Replace policy network with just a value network and UCT to remove dependence on action space
  - Use attention instead of convolutional neural networks to remove assumptions about board topology and spatial correlations
  - Use UCT Monte Carlo Tree Search (rather than self-play) to generate training data quickly in parallel on CPUs

Key Contributions:
- First application of attention networks instead of CNNs for GGP to remove need for knowledge of board topology
- Show attention models are more robust when board tile order is randomized compared to CNNs
- Demonstrate that strong models can be produced quickly (in minutes) using MCTS-generated training data instead of self-play
- Evaluate approach on set of games in Regular Boardgames GGP system and show models exceed UCT baseline on most games while avoiding game-specific configuration

In summary, the paper presents adaptations to remove key assumptions made by AlphaZero that are inconsistent with pure GGP principles, while showing the models produced can still achieve strong performance across a variety of games. The attention architecture and fast parallel data generation facilitate efficient training for GGP.
