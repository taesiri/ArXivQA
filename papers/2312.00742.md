## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Scalable Meta-Learning with Gaussian Processes (ScaML-GP), a new modular Gaussian process model for meta-learning that scales linearly in the number of meta-tasks. The key idea is to make assumptions on the correlations between meta-tasks and the test task in order to decompose the multi-task kernel into independent per-task kernels. This allows efficient parallel training and yields a test-task prior distribution that is a weighted sum of the meta-task posteriors. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrate that ScaML-GP can effectively leverage meta-data to speed up learning on new tasks. A key advantage over existing methods is that ScaML-GP performs a principled Bayesian treatment of uncertainty across tasks, enabling better exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The method works well both with few and many meta-tasks, consistently achieving the lowest regret across varying amounts of meta-data. Overall, ScaML-GP advances the state-of-the-art in GP-based meta-learning for global optimization problems with scarce data.
