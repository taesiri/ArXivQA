# [DeepPolar: Inventing Nonlinear Large-Kernel Polar Codes via Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reliable digital communication requires error correction codes to add redundancy and enable receivers to reconstruct the message. Polar codes, invented by Arikan in 2009, are revolutionary in achieving the Shannon capacity with low encoding/decoding complexity. 
- However, practical finite-length performance of Polar codes is lacking. Recent advances like CRC concatenation and successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding enhance their performance considerably in short-to-medium blocklength regimes.
- An alternative approach to improve Polar codes involves increasing the kernel size beyond the standard 2x2 kernel used by Arikan. Larger kernels lead to faster channel polarization. However, effectively developing large kernel Polar codes has remained an unsolved challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes \dpolar codes, a novel non-linear generalization of large kernel Polar codes using neural networks. 
- The core innovations are: (1) expanding the kernel size to enable the neural network to explore a richer function space (2) introducing non-linearity by parameterizing the kernel transformations using NNs (3) designing a matching neural successive cancellation decoder.
- A curriculum strategy leveraging the nested hierarchy of coding structures is proposed to enhance generalization.  

Main Contributions:
- \dpolar codes outperform classical Polar codes, state-of-the-art ML-based KO codes, as well as RM codes across a range of rates, demonstrating the benefits of non-linear kernels.
- Analysis reveals \dpolar's distance spectrum closely matches a Gaussian codebook, which is capacity achieving, shedding light on why they work.  
- The training methodology and architectural innovations allow \dpolar to scale to different blocklengths and code rates.
- The work underscores the potential of combining channel coding principles with deep learning to make coding breakthroughs.
