# [AIx Speed: Playback Speed Optimization Using Listening Comprehension of   Speech Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Humans can comprehend audio/video content at faster speeds than actual speed. However, manually adjusting playback speed for each piece of content is tedious. 
- Existing methods automatically adjust playback speed but don't explicitly model speech intelligibility at different speeds. They also vary speed at coarse segments rather than finer phoneme level.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AIx Speed, a system that optimizes audiovisual playback speed at the phoneme level while maintaining intelligibility. 
- It uses a speech recognition model as a proxy for human listening ability. An experiment confirmed that human and model listening comprehension degrade similarly with increasing playback speed.
- The system has two components:
   1) Playback speed adjuster: Maximizes speed using a self-supervised model while constraining via an intelligibility-based loss term.
   2) Speech recognizer: Evaluates intelligibility of sped-up speech.
- Both models are jointly trained to maximize playback speed subject to keeping speech recognizable.

Contributions:
- Shows speech recognizers can substitute for assessing human listening comprehension vs. playback speed.
- Proposes method to increase video playback speed at the phoneme-level while maintaining speech intelligibility.
- Demonstrates the method can also improve non-native speech intelligibility by optimizing speed.
- Evaluations show the method produces more intelligible fast speech compared to simple fixed speedup baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a novel system to optimize audio/video playback speed at a fine-grained phoneme level based on a speech recognition model while preserving intelligibility. Evaluations demonstrate its ability to produce understandable high speed speech.
