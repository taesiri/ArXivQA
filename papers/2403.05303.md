# [ACLSum: A New Dataset for Aspect-based Summarization of Scientific   Publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05303)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing summarization datasets often have issues like unreliable quality, legal restrictions, noisy data, and lack of extractive labels. This makes them suboptimal for training and evaluating summarization systems.
- There is a lack of high-quality multi-aspect summarization datasets, especially for the scholarly domain.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents ACLSum, a new manually annotated and validated multi-aspect summarization dataset for scientific papers. 
- The dataset contains 250 scientific papers with extractive highlights and abstractive one-sentence summaries for 3 aspects: Challenge, Approach, and Outcome.
- The quality of the dataset was validated by domain experts along relevance, consistency, and fluency metrics. The summaries scored highly on these metrics.

Main Contributions:  
- A new high-quality multi-aspect summarization dataset for scientific papers with both extractive and abstractive annotations.
- Detailed empirical analysis comparing extract-then-abstract vs end-to-end summarization strategies.
- Evaluation of a commonly used heuristic for extractive summary generation, showing its low quality compared to human annotations.
- Experiments with pretrained and large language models tuned on the dataset for summarization.
- Analysis showing the Challenge aspect requires more abstraction and is most difficult to summarize.

The paper makes a valuable contribution by creating a reliable benchmark summarization dataset for the scholarly domain. Both extractive and abstractive models are evaluated on this dataset to analyze their effectiveness.
