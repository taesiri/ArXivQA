# [Pre-training Differentially Private Models with Limited Public Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18752)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large foundation models rely on massive high-quality data for superior performance, but much of this data contains sensitive, private information that requires protection. 
- Differential privacy (DP) has been applied successfully during model fine-tuning, but not during the initial pre-training stage which uses the majority of data. 
- Applying DP during pre-training leads to significant performance degradation compared to standard pre-training.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide theoretical understanding of DP training efficacy by analyzing per-iteration loss improvement through the lens of Hessian matrices. Identify a "decelerator" term that characterizes DP slowdown.
- Show theoretically and empirically that DP pre-training is more vulnerable to noise than DP fine-tuning. The "decelerator" effect is larger in pre-training. 
- Propose a DP continual pre-training strategy that mitigates the "decelerator" effect by using a small amount of public data (10%) for initial pre-training before switching to private data.

Contributions:
- New Hessian-based framework to analyze effects of DP mechanisms (gradient clipping, adding noise) and hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate) on per-iteration loss improvement.
- Identify and analyze "decelerator" term that explains DP performance degradation, especially during pre-training. 
- Effective DP continual pre-training strategy that achieves accuracy comparable to standard pre-training while protecting privacy. 
- State-of-the-art results on ImageNet and downstream tasks using DP continually pre-trained ViT model with only 10% public data.

In summary, the paper provides new theoretical analysis to explain challenges in DP pre-training, and proposes an effective strategy to mitigate these issues using limited public data. The continually DP pre-trained models achieve excellent accuracy while protecting data privacy.
