# [Accurate Differential Operators for Hybrid Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper identifies an issue with hybrid neural fields, which are neural networks that represent spatial functions by combining a small MLP with explicit spatial features stored on a grid. While hybrid neural fields can be trained quickly to represent large, complex scenes, they yield noisy derivatives when using automatic differentiation. This causes artifacts when using the fields for applications like rendering and simulation. 

The key insight is that while hybrid neural fields are trained to accurately represent the signal itself, there is no guarantee on the quality of the signal's derivatives. Furthermore, since hybrid fields are designed to reproduce high-frequency details, they tend to learn solutions with abundant high-frequency noise components, even though the noise magnitude itself is small. When taking derivatives, this high-frequency noise gets amplified, causing significant errors.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two approaches to obtain accurate derivatives from hybrid neural fields:

1. A post-hoc polynomial-fitting operator that locally fits a low-order polynomial to the field before taking derivatives. This smoothing removes high-frequency noise while retaining macro-scale derivatives.

2. A method to fine-tune the pre-trained hybrid field itself to improve automatic differentiation derivatives. It uses the accurate derivatives from the polynomial-fitting operator as supervision to train the network to yield smoother autodiff derivatives.

Main Contributions:
1) Identifies the issue of inaccurate autodiff derivatives in hybrid neural fields and relates it to high-frequency noise amplification. 

2) Proposes a post-hoc polynomial-fitting operator to smooth the field and obtain accurate macro-scale derivatives.

3) Also proposes a fine-tuning approach that directly improves the quality of a network's autodiff derivatives while preserving the initial signal approximation.

The methods are shown to reduce errors in derivatives by 4x, which leads to significantly reduced artifacts when using hybrid neural fields for rendering and simulation.
