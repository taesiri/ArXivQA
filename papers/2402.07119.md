## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Medical image segmentation aims to delineate structures of interest in medical images. Deep learning has shown remarkable success in this task. However, performance is limited by scarce annotated medical data. Self-supervised learning creates auxiliary tasks from available data to enrich model knowledge and boost performance. Existing methods commonly adopt joint training to concurrently solve segmentation and heterogeneous auxiliary tasks. However, knowledge transfer can be ineffective due to interference among divergent tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
A two-stage multi-task self-supervised learning approach is proposed. In stage 1, the segmentation task is independently co-solved with each auxiliary task using both joint training and pre-training modes. The better model from the two modes is selected for each task. Multiple elite segmentation models are obtained, each facilitated by an auxiliary task using the optimal training mode. In stage 2, these models are aggregated into one using ensemble knowledge distillation to match the student's outputs with the teacher ensemble's outputs.  

Main Contributions:
1) A two-stage training approach that allows heterogeneous auxiliary tasks to be leveraged more effectively by avoiding interference and adaptively adopting the appropriate training mode.

2) Ensemble knowledge distillation is used to aggregate the diverse knowledge obtained from multiple auxiliary tasks into one student model.

3) Experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing multi-task learning methods for medical image segmentation using scarce annotated data. It matches the performance obtained with twice more annotated data using conventional training.

In summary, the key ideas are to independently leverage each auxiliary task using the optimal training mode in stage 1 and then aggregate the obtained elite models in stage 2. This allows heterogeneous tasks to be effectively used to enrich model knowledge and boost performance under scarce annotated medical data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage multi-task self-supervised learning approach for medical image segmentation that first independently trains segmentation models using each auxiliary task in joint and pre-training modes, then aggregates the models into one via ensemble knowledge distillation to effectively leverage complementary advantages of heterogeneous auxiliary tasks under limited training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage multi-task self-supervised learning approach to leverage multiple heterogeneous auxiliary tasks to boost the performance of a target medical image segmentation task under scarce training data. 

Specifically, in the first stage, the target segmentation task is independently co-solved with each auxiliary task using both joint training and pre-training modes, and the better model is selected for each auxiliary task. This allows avoiding the interference among tasks and using the most appropriate training mode for each task. 

In the second stage, the models obtained for different auxiliary tasks are aggregated into a single model via an ensemble knowledge distillation method. This transfers the complementary knowledge obtained from various auxiliary tasks into one model to further improve performance.

The key ideas are: 1) independent training with each task using suitable modes to avoid interference; 2) ensemble distillation to aggregate diverse knowledge. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing methods in leveraging multiple auxiliary tasks.

The paper proposes a two-stage multi-task self-supervised learning approach to address the data scarcity issue in medical image segmentation. It leverages multiple heterogeneous auxiliary tasks in a self-supervised manner to facilitate solving the target segmentation task. The key idea is to independently leverage each auxiliary task via joint training or pre-training in the first stage, and then aggregate the models trained with different auxiliary tasks into one model via ensemble knowledge distillation in the second stage. This allows complementary knowledge transfer from various auxiliary tasks while avoiding the interference among them.
