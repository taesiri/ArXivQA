# [VeRi3D: Generative Vertex-based Radiance Fields for 3D Controllable   Human Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04800)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we build a generative 3D-aware model for photorealistic human image synthesis that provides explicit control over pose, shape, appearance, and parts?

The key hypothesis is that incorporating a parametric human model (SMPL) will allow the generative model to achieve better generalization to novel poses/shapes and enable part-level control, compared to prior work on neural radiance fields for humans. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a vertex-based radiance field representation, VeRi3D, that maps 3D points to color/density based on features of nearest SMPL vertices. This representation aims to achieve the following:

1) Generalization to novel poses by transforming points to vertex-local coordinate systems 

2) Generalization to novel shapes by manipulating vertex locations

3) Part-level control by editing vertex features 

The central research question is whether this vertex-based radiance field parameterized by a human model can achieve superior performance on controllable human image synthesis compared to prior art. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on pose/shape generalization and part editing.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that incorporating an explicit human model will allow for learning a generative radiance field that achieves better generalization and controllability for photorealistic human rendering. The vertex-based representation is proposed as a way to effectively incorporate the human model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing VeRi3D, a generative vertex-based human radiance field for 3D controllable human image synthesis. 

2. Incorporating the parametric human template SMPL into the radiance field representation in three aspects:

- Mapping points from observation space to canonical space using SMPL skinning weights for pose invariance. 

- Representing points using features of neighboring SMPL vertices and offsets for shape invariance.

- Learning vertex features with a 2D CNN on the SMPL UV map for part controllability.

3. Demonstrating that VeRi3D allows generating photorealistic human images with control over camera viewpoint, body pose/shape, and part-level editing.

4. Showing strong qualitative and quantitative results on DeepFashion, Surreal, and AIST++ datasets for unconditional image synthesis. Also showing competitive results on the ZJU-MoCap dataset for reconstruction.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel way of incorporating a parametric human model into a generative radiance field to achieve better generalization and controllability for 3D-aware human image synthesis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a 3D-aware generative adversarial network method called VeRi3D that can generate controllable radiance fields of human bodies, enabling control over pose, shape, appearance, and part-level editing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for generating controllable radiance fields for human bodies, enabling control over pose, shape, and part-level appearance. Here are some key ways this paper compares to related work:

- It builds on recent work on learning neural radiance fields in a generative setting (GRAF, Pi-GAN, EG3D, etc). However, those methods focus on non-articulated objects like faces and cars. This paper adapts the radiance field idea to articulated human bodies.

- Compared to other generative models for humans like SMPLicit and CAPE, this method can generate photo-realistic RGB images rather than just geometry/shape. It also does not require any 3D supervision.

- Relative to recent works on neural human radiance fields (ENARF, GNARF, AvatarGen), a key contribution is incorporating an explicit human model (SMPL) to enable better generalization and control. The vertex-based representation also avoids ghosting artifacts. 

- The level of control offered, especially part-level editing, goes beyond most prior human generative models. The controllability is comparable to SMPL and SMPL-based methods, while also generating realistic appearance.

- The image quality and pose/shape generalization ability is superior to existing neural human radiance fields like ENARF. The results are quite competitive to state-of-the-art on common benchmarks.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in 3D-aware generative modeling of humans by combining the benefits of classical parametric models and recent neural radiance fields. The vertex-based representation and incorporation of SMPL enables control and generalization not seen in prior neural human models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving generalization ability to novel poses: The authors mention their method relies on accurate pose distribution to respect the input pose. With mismatched pose distributions, e.g. bent legs estimated as straight ones, their method needs to generate bent legs from straight leg inputs. They suggest joint refinement of the pose distribution could address this.

- Reducing artifacts in less observed regions: The authors note their method may have artifacts in less observed regions like the back for forward-facing datasets. They suggest adding regularizations for unobservable regions could help resolve this.

- Accelerating high resolution synthesis: The nearest neighbor retrieval makes direct high resolution synthesis slow. Implementing custom CUDA kernels could accelerate this. 

- Modeling facial details: The current method does not capture fine facial details well. Allocating more vertices to the face region could address this limitation.

- Improving robustness to inaccurate data: The authors mention limitations from inaccurate backgrounds in AIST++ and mismatched pose distributions in DeepFashion. Jointly optimizing the inputs could improve robustness.

- Exploring conditional generation: The current method is limited to unconditional generation. Future work could explore conditioning on semantic maps or other inputs.

- Applications to virtual try-on, visual effects, etc.: The controllable generation could be applied to various applications like virtual try-on and visual effects, which the authors suggest exploring.

In summary, the main suggested directions are improving generalization, reducing artifacts, accelerating synthesis, adding facial details, handling inaccurate data better, conditional generation, and exploring applications. The controllable neural radiance field approach seems promising but still has some limitations to address in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a 3D-aware generative adversarial network method called VeRi3D for generating controllable radiance fields of human bodies. The key idea is to parametrize the generative human radiance field using a set of vertices predefined by the SMPL human model, and learn distributions over the vertex features to generate diverse human images. Specifically, they transform a 3D point to the individual local coordinate systems of its nearest SMPL vertices, and map the point to color and density values based on the vertex features and local coordinates. This allows generating photorealistic human images with control over camera pose, human pose, shape, and part-level editing. The vertex features are generated efficiently using a 2D convolutional neural network based on the UV mapping of SMPL vertices. Experiments demonstrate superior performance on unconditional human image synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods like ENARF and GNARF, as well as competitive results on human body reconstruction. The controllability over pose, shape and parts is also demonstrated qualitatively.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new 3D-aware generative adversarial network method for generating controllable radiance fields of human bodies. The key idea is to parametrize the generative human radiance field using a set of vertices predefined by the SMPL human model, and learn distributions over the vertex features to generate diverse human images. Specifically, they transform a 3D point to the local coordinate systems defined by the nearest SMPL vertices. The vertex features and local coordinates are then used to map the point to color and density values. This allows controlling human pose and shape by manipulating vertex locations. It also enables part-level control by editing vertex features of body parts. 

The benefits of this vertex-based representation are: 1) It allows learning a pose-agnostic representation without mapping to a shared global space, avoiding ghosting artifacts; 2) The formulation naturally enables explicit control over pose, shape, and parts; 3) It is efficient since features are generated on a 2D UV map. Experiments demonstrate high quality image synthesis on various datasets. The method enables control over pose, shape, appearance, and part-level editing. The vertex-based representation also achieves competitive reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Limitations include sensitivity to inaccurate pose distributions and background segmentations. Overall, this is a novel generative human radiance field representation that combines controllability of parametric models with image fidelity of 3D-aware GANs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes VeRi3D, a generative vertex-based human radiance field that offers controllable synthesis of human images. The key idea is to parametrize the radiance field using the vertices and feature vectors from the SMPL human body model. Each 3D point is transformed to the local coordinate system of its nearest SMPL vertices. The corresponding vertex features and local coordinates are then mapped to color and density values using a multi-layer perceptron. This formulation allows control over pose, shape, and appearance by editing the vertex locations or features. The vertex features are generated efficiently using a 2D convolutional network based on SMPL's UV mapping. VeRi3D demonstrates high-quality human image synthesis, generalizing to novel poses and shapes as well as enabling part-level editing. The model is trained using adversarial learning on 2D image collections with estimated camera and SMPL parameters.
