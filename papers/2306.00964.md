# [Cocktail: Mixing Multi-Modality Controls for Text-Conditional Image   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00964)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main research focus of this paper seems to be developing a pipeline called "Cocktail" to enable multi-modal and spatially-refined control for text-conditional diffusion models. The key elements they propose are:- A generalized ControlNet (gControlNet) that can accept and align control signals from different modalities and integrate them into a pre-trained diffusion model.- A controllable normalization method (ControlNorm) to fuse the control signals from gControlNet and inject them into the diffusion model backbone.- A spatial guidance sampling method to incorporate the control signals into specific image regions and avoid generating undesired objects.Overall, the central hypothesis appears to be that by mixing various modalities through gControlNet, fusing the signals with ControlNorm, and spatially guiding sampling, they can achieve more flexible and precise multi-modal control over text-conditional image generation compared to prior approaches. The aim is to generate high quality images that faithfully reflect multiple simultaneous control signals input by the user.
