# [Can Large Language Models Reason and Plan?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There has been recent hype about whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can actually reason and plan in addition to their language generation capabilities. 

- LLMs are effectively giant non-veridical memories that excel at a form of "universal approximate retrieval" where they probabilistically reconstruct likely completions for a prompt. But this doesn't guarantee accuracy or reasoning abilities.

- So the paper sets out to evaluate whether claims of reasoning/planning abilities of LLMs actually hold up to scrutiny.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

- The author conducted experiments evaluating GPT-3 and GPT-4 on planning tasks using standard AI planning competition benchmarks.

- The results show modest gains from GPT-3 to GPT-4, but performance still quite low, with GPT-4 only reaching 30% accuracy on Blocks World problems.

- Obfuscating object/action names causes performance to plummet, indicating reliance on approximate retrieval rather than actual planning.

- Fine-tuning and human-in-the-loop prompting can improve performance, but this actually just compiles planning knowledge into the LLM rather than enabling reasoning.

- The paper argues that current evidence does not compel a conclusion that LLMs can autonomously reason/plan. Their strength lies in approximate retrieval.

- However, LLMs can still be useful as idea generators in "LLM-Modulo" frameworks combined with separate reasoning modules and verification.

In summary, the paper provides an empirical evaluation challenging claims that LLMs can reason, proposing they lack such capabilities but can play an assisting role to other reasoning systems.
