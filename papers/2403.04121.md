# [Can Large Language Models Reason and Plan?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There has been recent hype about whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can actually reason and plan in addition to their language generation capabilities. 

- LLMs are effectively giant non-veridical memories that excel at a form of "universal approximate retrieval" where they probabilistically reconstruct likely completions for a prompt. But this doesn't guarantee accuracy or reasoning abilities.

- So the paper sets out to evaluate whether claims of reasoning/planning abilities of LLMs actually hold up to scrutiny.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

- The author conducted experiments evaluating GPT-3 and GPT-4 on planning tasks using standard AI planning competition benchmarks.

- The results show modest gains from GPT-3 to GPT-4, but performance still quite low, with GPT-4 only reaching 30% accuracy on Blocks World problems.

- Obfuscating object/action names causes performance to plummet, indicating reliance on approximate retrieval rather than actual planning.

- Fine-tuning and human-in-the-loop prompting can improve performance, but this actually just compiles planning knowledge into the LLM rather than enabling reasoning.

- The paper argues that current evidence does not compel a conclusion that LLMs can autonomously reason/plan. Their strength lies in approximate retrieval.

- However, LLMs can still be useful as idea generators in "LLM-Modulo" frameworks combined with separate reasoning modules and verification.

In summary, the paper provides an empirical evaluation challenging claims that LLMs can reason, proposing they lack such capabilities but can play an assisting role to other reasoning systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper argues that while large language models can provide useful approximate knowledge for reasoning and planning tasks, they do not actually perform principled reasoning or planning themselves.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is critically evaluating and questioning the claims that large language models (LLMs) are capable of reasoning and planning. 

Specifically, the paper:

1) Explains why the training methodology and approximate retrieval abilities of LLMs do not lend themselves to principled reasoning capabilities. LLMs are good at generating guesses but not at guaranteeing correctness or doing systematic search.

2) Discusses experiments done by the author's group showing that LLMs struggle at planning tasks, especially when approximate retrieval is made harder through obfuscation. This suggests they are relying more on pattern matching than actual planning.

3) Analyzes the methodologies behind papers that claim reasoning abilities for LLMs and argues they either simplify the tasks too much or rely on humans/simulators in the loop to resolve subgoal interactions and verify solutions.

4) Proposes "LLM-Modulo" frameworks that combine the idea generation capacities of LLMs with sound external verifiers to produce solutions with correctness guarantees.

5) Draws parallels between using LLMs as knowledge sources and earlier knowledge-based AI systems, arguing LLMs can provide approximate domain knowledge to otherwise sound planning/reasoning systems.

In summary, the main contribution is a detailed, evidence-based analysis questioning planning/reasoning abilities of LLMs, while proposing constructive ways they can still be utilized. The overall skeptical yet balanced perspective is the paper's distinguishing aspect.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts discussed are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Approximate retrieval
- Planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs
- System 1 and System 2
- LLM-Modulo frameworks
- Fine-tuning LLMs 
- Self-verification by LLMs
- Clever Hans effect
- Knowledge acquisition from LLMs
- Avenging Pólya's revenge

The paper examines whether large language models can actually reason and plan, as claimed in some papers, or whether they just exhibit a form of "approximate retrieval" that gives the appearance of reasoning. Concepts like the LLM-Modulo framework, fine-tuning, and self-verification are different techniques used or proposed to try to get LLMs to demonstrate reasoning abilities. The Clever Hans effect and avenging Pólya's revenge are also important ideas that help explain the limitations of LLMs and connections to previous AI techniques. But in summary, the paper argues LLMs do not truly reason or plan on their own, even if their output sometimes appears reasonable.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "LLM-Modulo" framework that combines the strength of large language models (LLMs) in generating candidate solutions with external verifiers that check correctness. What are some of the key challenges in designing effective verifiers and critique generators for this framework?

2. The paper argues that iterative human prompting of LLMs can lead to the "Clever Hans effect" where the human is unintentionally steering the LLM. What safeguards can be built into human-LLM interaction protocols to reduce this effect? 

3. The paper advocates using LLMs as approximate knowledge sources rather than ascribing reasoning abilities to them. What are some good strategies to extract high quality domain and planning knowledge from LLMs while minimizing hallucinated or incorrect knowledge?

4. The paper suggests LLMs have limitations in terms of guaranteeing complete and consistent plans. How can the plan execution and monitoring stages be designed to detect flaws in LLM-generated plans and handle failures gracefully? 

5. What are some good metrics to evaluate the performance of LLM-Modulo frameworks on planning and reasoning tasks? How can both solution quality and computational efficiency be captured?

6. The paper argues that self-verification of solutions by LLMs can be problematic. What modifications can be made to the training and fine-tuning of LLMs to make them better self-critics? 

7. What are some reasoning and planning tasks that are particularly challenging for current LLMs? What adaptations to network architecture, training methodology etc. can make progress on those fronts?

8. How suitable is the LLM-Modulo approach for real-time planning problems where critiquing and re-generation needs to be fast? What approximations can be made?

9. The paper focuses on planning but also mentions implications for program synthesis. How can LLM-Modulo ideas be extended to that domain? What types of verifiers are most promising there?

10. What lessons and inspirations can LLM-Modulo frameworks draw from past knowledge-based AI systems? What are key differences in knowledge acquisition, representation and reasoning?
