# [Large-scale Language Model Rescoring on Long-form Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08133)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What is the impact of using large-scale language models (LLMs) for rescoring n-best lists in long-form automated speech recognition (ASR)?The key hypothesis appears to be that LLMs trained on vast amounts of text data can significantly improve the performance of long-form ASR when used to rescore n-best lists from a first-pass ASR system. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:- LLMs are complementary to conventional neural LMs and maximum entropy LMs, and combining them can yield additive gains.- LLMs can help reduce word error rate (WER) and salient term error rate (STER) substantially compared to just using a maximum entropy LM. - Fine-tuning multilingual LLMs on in-domain code-switched data is important for improved performance on code-switched test sets.- Carrying over context from previous segments and using non-tree structured lattices can further improve the gains from LLM rescoring in long-form ASR.So in summary, the main research question is examining if LLMs can boost long-form ASR accuracy, and the key hypotheses are around the complementary benefits of LLMs, their ability to improve WER and STER, the importance of in-domain fine-tuning, and the benefits of context and lattice structure. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.
