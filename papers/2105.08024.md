# [Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Is Feasible for Linearly   Realizable MDPs with Limited Revisiting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08024)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation when the optimal Q-function is assumed to be linearly representable. Prior works have shown that exponentially many samples are required to solve such problems in the standard online RL setting, even with a constant sub-optimality gap between optimal and suboptimal actions. To overcome this barrier, the authors propose a more flexible sampling protocol that allows controlled revisiting of previously visited states, resembling realistic scenarios like save files in video games. They develop an algorithm called LinQ-LSVI-UCB adapted from prior work, which implements optimism and harness the sub-optimality gap to selectively revisit states. A key analysis reveals that by revisiting states in a careful manner, the proposed algorithm attains a sample complexity scaling polynomially with the feature dimension, time horizon, and inverse gap, but independently of the huge state/action space. These results demonstrate how the interplay between sampling flexibility and linear function representation plays a pivotal role in enabling sample-efficient RL. Overall, this paper makes progress towards reconciling theory and practice for linear reinforcement learning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies reinforcement learning with linear function approximation for the optimal Q-function. Prior work showed exponential sample complexity lower bounds even with a constant sub-optimality gap. This paper proposes a more flexible sampling protocol that allows controlled state revisiting. A new algorithm called LinQ-LSVI-UCB is developed, which implements optimism and exploits the gap condition to determine when to revisit states. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves polynomial sample complexity that scales with feature dimension, horizon, and inverse gap, but not state/action space size. The results underscore how the sampling protocol and function representation interact closely in facilitating efficient reinforcement learning. Overall, this paper makes progress in understanding reinforcement learning with linear $Q^*$ approximation by considering a practical sampling protocol beyond standard online setting.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:

Whether there exist practically relevant sampling mechanisms that are more flexible than standard online RL yet more practical than the generative model, which can enable sample-efficient reinforcement learning when the optimal Q-function is linearly realizable. 

Specifically, the paper proposes and analyzes a new sampling protocol called "sampling with state revisiting", which allows the agent to revisit and redraw samples from previously visited states within an episode. This protocol is more flexible than standard online RL where the agent cannot revisit states, but more restrictive than having a generative model where the agent can sample arbitrary state-action pairs. 

The paper develops an algorithm called LinQ-LSVI-UCB tailored for this sampling protocol and shows that it can achieve a sample complexity polynomial in the feature dimension, horizon and inverse sub-optimality gap, but independent of the state/action space size. This demonstrates the feasibility of sample-efficient RL under this intermediate sampling setting.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by permitting a certain degree of state revisiting, sample-efficient RL becomes possible under linear $Q^*$ realizability, overcoming barriers faced under standard online RL sampling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an algorithm called LinQ-LSVI-UCB that achieves sample-efficient reinforcement learning for MDPs with linearly realizable optimal Q-functions under a new sampling protocol. Specifically:

- The paper studies a flexible sampling protocol that allows for controlled and infrequent revisiting of previously visited states within an episode (in addition to the standard online/exploratory sampling). This is more practical than assuming a generative model.

- The paper develops the LinQ-LSVI-UCB algorithm tailored for this sampling protocol. The algorithm exploits the knowledge of the sub-optimality gap to determine when to backtrack and revisit states. 

- Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm enjoys a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the feature dimension, horizon, and inverse sub-optimality gap, but is independent of the size of the state/action space. This demonstrates significant sample efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a practical sampling protocol and an accompanying sample-efficient algorithm for MDPs with linear $Q^{\star}$, highlighting the pivotal interplay between sampling protocols and linear function approximation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 According to the discussion section, the authors suggest several potential directions for future research:

1. Identify other flexible yet practically relevant online RL sampling mechanisms that also allow for sample size reduction, beyond the state revisiting protocol studied in this paper. 

2. Derive information-theoretic sampling limits for various linear function approximation classes used in RL, and characterize the interplay between low-dimensional representation and sampling constraints. 

3. Go beyond linear realizability assumptions, such as the recent work that assumed $Q^{\pi}$ is linearly realizable for any policy $\pi$. Understand the sample complexity limits for this class of function approximations, particularly when state revisiting is not allowed.

4. More broadly, the authors suggest that linear function approximation for online RL remains a rich territory for further theoretical investigation in order to obtain a more complete picture. There are still open questions regarding the feasibility, limitations, and interplay of different algorithm families, function classes, and sampling mechanisms.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: (i) study other relevant sampling settings, (ii) information-theoretic limits under linear representation, (iii) extensions to broader function classes beyond linear realizability, and (iv) a more complete theoretical picture of linear function approximation in online RL.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Sample efficiency
- Linearly realizable optimal Q-function
- Sub-optimality gap 
- State revisiting
- Online RL sampling protocol
- Regret bounds
- Markov decision process (MDP)
- Value function approximation
- Linear function approximation

The paper develops a new sampling protocol for reinforcement learning that allows controlled state revisiting, in order to achieve improved sample efficiency guarantees. Under an assumption of linearly realizable optimal Q-functions and the presence of a sub-optimality gap, the proposed algorithm achieves a polynomial sample complexity that does not scale with the state/action space size. The analysis involves regret bounds and properties of Markov decision processes. Overall, it provides an interesting case study on how sampling protocols interact with function approximation classes in RL.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new sampling protocol that allows state revisiting. How is this sampling protocol more flexible than standard online RL settings while still being practical? What are some real-world scenarios where this type of sampling would be relevant?

2. Explain in detail the key differences between the proposed LinQ-LSVI-UCB algorithm and the LSVI-UCB algorithm for linear MDPs. In particular, discuss the differences in how the Q-function estimates are updated. 

3. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a regret bound that scales polynomially with the feature dimension $d$, horizon $H$, and $\frac{1}{\Delta_{gap}}$. Walk through the key steps of the proof and explain how each of these terms arises. 

4. Discuss the differences between analyzing regret over episodes versus regret over paths for this setting with state revisiting. What additional challenges arise when analyzing regret over paths?

5. The paper shows both a worst-case $\sqrt{K}$ regret bound over paths as well as a logarithmic regret bound in expectation. Contrast these two bounds. When would each bound be most relevant or informative?

6. How does the analysis leverage properties of self-normalized processes and martingales? Explain how these concepts assist in controlling error propagation.

7. Compare and contrast the proposed approach to prior algorithms developed for the generative model setting. What modifications were necessary to adapt the approach to handle the more limited sampling flexibility? 

8. The strength of the regret bounds relies heavily on the gap assumption Δ. Discuss whether and how the performance guarantees degrade when Δ approaches 0.

9. From a computational perspective, what are the main bottlenecks in implementing this algorithm? How do the runtime and memory complexity scale?

10. The paper focuses specifically on linear realizability of the optimal Q-function. How might the analysis differ if instead linear realizability of the transition model or reward function were assumed? Identify any key analysis steps that would need to change.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work on sample-efficient reinforcement learning with linear function approximation:

- This paper focuses specifically on the setting where only the optimal Q-function is linearly representable, which is a weaker assumption than linear MDPs or policy completeness. Prior work has studied cases like deterministic systems, low inherent Bellman error, etc. This paper provides novel results for the linear $Q^{\star}$ setting.

- The paper introduces a new sampling protocol that allows controlled state revisiting, which is more flexible than standard online RL but more practical than assuming a generative model. Prior work has studied state revisiting in limited contexts, but the analysis here is more general. 

- The proposed LinQ-LSVI-UCB algorithm achieves a polynomial sample complexity in key parameters like feature dimension and 1/gap, but not the ambient state/action space size. This demonstrates efficient RL is feasible in this setting. Prior work showed exponential lower bounds in the same setting without state revisiting.  

- The paper provides both worst-case and expected regret bounds. The expected regret bound is logarithmic in the number of paths, which significantly improves over the worst-case bound and matches related work on logarithmic regret.

- Compared to prior work on the linear $Q^{\star}$ case with a generative model or restricted state revisiting, this paper provides more practical algorithms and analysis for the broader setting. The interplay between sampling protocols and function classes is explored more deeply here.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions towards understanding sample-efficient RL with linear function approximation, especially for the challenging but practical linear $Q^{\star}$ case, under a flexible sampling model. The results significantly expand our knowledge of when efficient RL is possible.
