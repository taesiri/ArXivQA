# [Do Models Explain Themselves? Counterfactual Simulatability of Natural   Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08678)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are trained to provide human-like explanations, but it is unclear if their explanations actually help humans understand the model's reasoning process and generalize it to new inputs. Specifically, can humans use an LLM's explanation to accurately predict how the LLM will behave on counterfactual inputs?

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose evaluating "counterfactual simulatability" of LLM explanations - whether an explanation allows humans to precisely guess the LLM's outputs on diverse counterfactual variants of the input question.

- They introduce two metrics - simulation precision (fraction of counterfactuals where human's guess matches model's actual output) and simulation generality (diversity of relevant counterfactuals, measured by similarity).

- To obtain counterfactual questions, the authors prompt LLMs to generate variants of input questions that are relevant to the explanation. 

- They collect human judgments on whether the explanation logically entails certain model outputs on counterfactuals.

Experiments and Results:
- Benchmarked explanations from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on multi-hop reasoning (SQA) and preference modeling (SHP) tasks.

- Found LLMs' explanations have low precision (80% on binary classification). Chain-of-thought does not substantially outperform post-hoc explanation.

- Precision does not correlate with plausibility scores. So optimizing human approvals may not improve counterfactual simulatability.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized the notion of counterfactual simulatability of free-form explanations
- Implemented quantitative metrics - precision and generality
- Showed state-of-the-art LLM explanations can be imprecise and mislead humans on counterfactuals


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes evaluating natural language explanations by whether they enable humans to precisely infer a model's outputs on diverse counterfactual inputs, and finds that current state-of-the-art language model explanations have low precision and do not correlate with plausibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new evaluation framework and metrics to measure the "counterfactual simulatability" of natural language explanations from AI systems. Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Evaluating whether an explanation can help humans build accurate mental models that allow them to infer how the AI system will behave on diverse counterfactual inputs. This tests if the explanation generalizes beyond just the specific input it was provided for.

2) Proposing two metrics - simulation generality and simulation precision - to quantify counterfactual simulatability. Generality measures the diversity of counterfactuals an explanation supports. Precision measures if humans' inferences match the model's actual outputs on those counterfactuals.

3) Implementing this evaluation pipeline and benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The results reveal issues with the precision of LLM explanations, suggesting room for improvement.

4) Studying the relationship between counterfactual simulatability and existing metrics like plausibility. The lack of correlation suggests optimizing for human preferences alone may not improve mental model accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel framework and metrics for evaluating if explanations help build generalizable yet precise mental models of AI system behavior. The results provide insights into issues with current LLM explanations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Counterfactual simulatability - Evaluating whether an explanation can help humans infer how a model will process different counterfactual inputs.

- Mental models - Humans' internal conceptual representations of how a system works. Explanations should help humans build accurate mental models.  

- Generality - Measures the diversity of counterfactuals that an explanation helps a human simulator predict outputs for.

- Precision - Measures the fraction of counterfactuals where the human simulator's predicted output matches the model's actual output.

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) - An explanation method where the model first generates a reasoning and then makes a prediction conditioned on that reasoning. 

- Post-hoc explanation - An explanation generated after a model already made a prediction, conditioned on the input and output.

- Multi-hop reasoning - Answering questions that require implicit, step-by-step logical reasoning. Evaluated on the StrategyQA dataset.

- Reward modeling - Predicting human preferences over AI system behaviors. Evaluated on the Stanford Human Preferences dataset.

The key goal is evaluating whether explanations help humans build generalizable yet precise mental models of AI systems using the proposed counterfactual simulation setup.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes evaluating "counterfactual simulatability" of explanations. Can you elaborate on why this concept of simulating model behavior on counterfactual inputs is important for explanations? How is it different from existing explanation evaluation methods?

2. Two metrics are introduced - simulation precision and simulation generality. Can you walk through an example scenario illustrating how these metrics would be calculated in practice? What are some limitations or challenges in actually computing these metrics? 

3. The paper uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate counterfactual inputs for evaluating explanations. What are the tradeoffs in using LLMs versus human-authored counterfactuals? Could the quality of the counterfactuals impact the final evaluation results?

4. Human simulation is used to determine whether explanations enable guessing model outputs on counterfactuals. However, the paper notes human simulation can be subjective. Can you expand more on the techniques used to make this determination more objective? What are limitations?

5. The explanations are evaluated on two tasks - multi-hop reasoning and reward modeling. Do you think the evaluation framework and findings would generalize to other tasks like open-ended generation? What modifications might be needed?

6. Results show counterfactual simulatability does not correlate with plausibility. Why do you think that is the case? What implications does this have for methods that optimize exclusively for human-preferred explanations?

7. The paper focuses solely on evaluating English explanations. Do you foresee any challenges in applying this evaluation approach to explanations generated in other languages?

8. One limitation noted is that the evaluation depends heavily on the counterfactuals generated by the LLMs. How sensitive do you think the overall evaluation is to the counterfactual distribution? 

9. Beyond improved model debugging and transparency, what are some potential real-world benefits if models could generate explanations with high counterfactual simulatability?

10. The conclusion proposes using LLMs to optimize explanations directly for counterfactual simulatability via self-training. Do you think this is a promising direction? What difficulties might arise in that approach?
