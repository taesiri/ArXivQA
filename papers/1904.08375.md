# [Document Expansion by Query Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that expanding documents with predicted queries (using a neural sequence-to-sequence model) can improve retrieval effectiveness compared to just using the original document text. Specifically, the authors propose a method called "Doc2query" where they train a model to generate queries that are relevant to a given document, and then append those predicted queries to the document before indexing. They hypothesize that this document expansion approach will enrich the document representation and help match relevant documents to queries even when there is vocabulary mismatch between the original query and document texts. The experiments then test whether this Doc2query document expansion approach improves retrieval metrics like MRR and MAP compared to a baseline without expansion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple method for document expansion using neural networks. The key ideas are:- Train a sequence-to-sequence model to predict queries that a given document can potentially answer. - Use the model to expand documents by appending predicted queries to the original text.- Index the expanded documents and retrieve with standard methods like BM25.- Show that document expansion improves retrieval effectiveness on MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive results. - Demonstrate document expansion is more effective than query expansion on these datasets.- The approach shifts computational costs from retrieval to indexing, allowing fast retrieval without neural re-ranking.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting the first successful application of document expansion with neural networks, which gives better results than query expansion, is simple to implement, and improves efficiency.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in document expansion and neural information retrieval:- This is the first successful application of document expansion using neural networks, to the authors' knowledge. Previous work on neural document expansion has been limited. Most prior work focused on query expansion techniques.- The method is relatively simple - it uses a standard seq2seq model to generate queries for a document, and appends those to the document before indexing. But it is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art results on the TREC CAR dataset.- In contrast to most neural IR techniques which are used for re-ranking, this document expansion approach allows the computational costs of the neural model to be shifted to indexing time. Retrieval can then be done efficiently using standard inverted indexes and term matching.- The authors show that document expansion is more effective than query expansion techniques like RM3 on the datasets tested. They hypothesize this is because documents provide richer expansion signals than short queries.- Without re-ranking, the document expanded results are much faster but not far off in accuracy compared to computationally expensive neural rerankers like Duet. This makes the method suitable for low-latency retrieval scenarios.- The simplicity of the approach and use of existing open-source toolkits makes it easy to replicate the results and build further improvements.In summary, this paper presents a novel application of neural document expansion that is simple yet effective. It demonstrates advantages over both classic query expansion methods as well as other neural techniques. The results are state-of-the-art while also being easy to replicate.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other neural sequence-to-sequence architectures for document expansion. The authors used a standard transformer model, but mention there may be room for improvement with more sophisticated architectures.- Applying document expansion to other tasks beyond passage retrieval, such as ad-hoc document retrieval. The authors suggest their method could also be beneficial in those settings.- Combining document expansion with other retrieval techniques like query expansion. The authors found combining with pseudo-relevance feedback hurt effectiveness, but other query expansion methods may still be complementary. - Evaluating the tradeoffs between effectiveness gains and efficiency losses with document expansion in a real-world search engine setting. The authors note their method adds minimal latency, but more analysis is needed.- Exploring different decoding methods for generating the expanded queries. The authors experimented with beam search vs. random sampling, but other approaches like nucleus sampling could be tried.- Analysis of what words are generated during document expansion and how they improve retrieval. The authors did some initial analysis, but more work could further unpack the benefits.So in summary, the main suggestions are around exploring architectural variants, applying the method to new tasks, combining with other techniques like query expansion, and doing more in-depth analysis into why and how document expansion is effective.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a simple method to improve retrieval effectiveness by expanding documents with predicted queries before indexing. A sequence-to-sequence transformer model is trained to generate queries that are relevant to a given document. During indexing, the predicted queries are appended to each document to enrich its representation. Experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets show that retrieving with the expanded indexes yields better results than using the original indexes. The method achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness on TREC CAR when combined with neural re-ranking. A key advantage is that most of the computational cost is shifted to the indexing phase, while retrieval is much faster compared to neural ranking models. Overall, the paper presents a novel and effective application of document expansion using neural sequence-to-sequence models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a simple method for document expansion using neural networks. The key idea is to train a sequence-to-sequence model to predict queries that are relevant for a given document. These predicted queries are then appended to the original document to expand its representation. Specifically, the authors train a transformer model on query-document pairs to generate queries from documents. During indexing, they use this model to predict 10 queries for each document which are concatenated to the document text. Retrieval is done using BM25 on the expanded corpus. Without re-ranking, this document expansion approach improves effectiveness by 15% on the MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets over a BM25 baseline. The method is further enhanced by re-ranking retrieved documents with BERT, achieving state-of-the-art results on TREC CAR. A key advantage of document expansion is the ability to leverage neural networks to improve retrieval without expensive inference at query time. The authors argue document expansion is more effective than query expansion since documents provide richer signals. Overall, this work presents a simple but effective application of neural document expansion.
