# [A Survey on Verification and Validation, Testing and Evaluations of   Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models are opaque "black boxes", making testing, evaluation, verification and validation (TEVV) challenging. This is concerning for safety-critical applications.  
- Neurosymbolic AI combines the reasoning abilities of symbolic AI with the adaptability of deep learning. This has potential to improve TEVV.
- However, there is little research on TEVV methods for neurosymbolic systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Present and compare two taxonomies that categorize neurosymbolic systems based on architecture.
- Map concepts of TEVV from software engineering to symbolic and sub-symbolic AI. 
- Survey current TEVV approaches for symbolic (e.g. logic, knowledge graphs) and sub-symbolic (e.g. deep learning) AI.
- Analyze if current TEVV methods can be applied to isolated components of neurosymbolic systems.
- Investigate how different neurosymbolic architectures use symbolic part to enable TEVV of sub-symbolic part.

Main Contributions:
- Taxonomies help categorize diverse neurosymbolic approaches based on architecture.
- Identified limitations of logic verification methods regarding efficiency and noise tolerance.
- Testing methods applicable for common symbolic approaches like knowledge graphs and logic.
- Testing methods applicable for common sub-symbolic approaches like CNNs and RNNs.  
- Showed opportunities to use symbolic part for verifying, validating and explaining sub-symbolic predictions.
- Discussed open challenges regarding efficiency, testing emerging architectures, benchmarking efficiency against pure deep learning.

Overall, the paper demonstrates neurosymbolic AI's potential to improve TEVV over pure deep learning through symbolic verification, but more research is needed on tailored TEVV methods.
