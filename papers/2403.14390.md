# [From Large to Tiny: Distilling and Refining Mathematical Expertise for   Math Word Problems with Weakly Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Solving math word problems (MWPs) typically requires full supervision with annotated problem-equation pairs, which is expensive. Weakly supervised methods only require the problem and answer, but struggle to ensure semantic consistency between inferred equations and problem descriptions.
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can effectively solve MWPs via natural language, but have high computational demands.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage framework called "From Large to Tiny" (FLTT) that transfers mathematical expertise from LLMs to small models under weak supervision.
- Stage 1 - Knowledge Distilling: Use ChatGPT's natural language understanding to extract high-quality problem-equation pairs from weak supervision data via a process of auto-generation and error-correction. However, some data may be unsuccessfully searched due to uncertainty in LLM outputs.  
- Stage 2 - Knowledge Refining: Finetune a "middle" model on successfully searched data, then use it to re-search the unsuccessfully searched data to further leverage the weak supervision data.

Main Contributions:
1) Leverages LLM semantic capabilities to address false matching between problems and equations in existing weak supervision methods.
2) Proposes a two-stage distillation method combining knowledge distillation and refinement to automatically extract high-quality training data.
3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance for small models on Math23K and Weak12K datasets under weak supervision, approaching ChatGPT performance with much lower computational costs.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative framework to transfer mathematical expertise from large to small models for MWPs under weak supervision,demonstrating the potential of multi-stage knowledge distillation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework called From Large to Tiny (FLTT) that first distills mathematical knowledge from large language models like ChatGPT into high-quality problem-equation pairs using extraction and correction techniques, then further refines this data using a smaller model to train an efficient math word problem solver.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel weakly supervised method called FLTT that leverages ChatGPT to assist in searching for 'problem-equation' pairs. This effectively addresses the issue of erroneous matches present in current weakly supervised methods for math word problems.

2. Introducing a two-stage distillation method based on knowledge distillation and knowledge refinement to automatically search high-quality 'problem-equation' pairs to train a small model. 

3. Experimental results showing that the small model trained using the distilled data from the proposed method outperforms existing weakly supervised methods on the Math23K and Weak12K datasets. It achieves comparable performance to ChatGPT but with much lower computational costs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an innovative framework to transfer knowledge from large language models like ChatGPT to small models to solve math word problems under a weakly supervised setting, while overcoming limitations of existing methods. The two-stage distillation process enables training high-performance small models with minimal supervision and computational resources.
