# [Instruction-following Evaluation through Verbalizer Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10558)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we systematically and automatically evaluate instruction-tuned language models in terms of their instruction-following capability? 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new evaluation protocol called "verbalizer manipulation" to construct instructions that align with model priors to different extents.

- This allows examining models' reliance on priors and ability to override them to follow instructions accurately. 

- The paper tests this protocol on major model families across multiple datasets using natural, neutral, and unnatural verbalizers.

- The goal is to assess models' instruction-following abilities with minimal human effort by manipulating the alignment of instructions with prior knowledge.

So in summary, the central research question is focused on developing an automated way to evaluate how well instruction-tuned language models can follow human instructions, especially when those instructions go against the models' learned priors. The verbalizer manipulation protocol is proposed as a solution to enable systematic assessment of this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel evaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation for systematically assessing instruction-following capabilities of language models. 

The key ideas are:

- Verbalizer manipulation constructs instructions with verbalizers that align with model priors to different degrees - from natural (highly aligned), to neutral, to unnatural (contradicting priors).

- By controlling the alignment with priors through verbalizers, it can examine models' reliance on priors and ability to override them to accurately follow instructions.

- It can be seamlessly integrated with any classification benchmark with minimal human effort to synthesize varied instruction sets.

- Experiments on major model families demonstrate that performance on less natural verbalizers significantly distinguishes instruction-following abilities, even for powerful models like GPT-4.

In summary, the paper introduces verbalizer manipulation as an automatic framework to evaluate how well language models can follow human instructions, especially ones that do not align with their learned priors. This provides a useful methodology to assess and improve instruction-following capabilities of language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a new evaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation to systematically examine instruction-tuned language models' ability to follow instructions, finding even the strongest models struggle to override their priors and accurately follow instructions that contradict prior knowledge.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of instruction-following evaluation of large language models:

- The idea of using verbalizer manipulation to construct evaluation sets that align differently with model priors is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on human-curated instructions or prompts that are natural and align with the capabilities of existing models. Intentionally creating less natural prompts that go against model priors provides a new way to probe instruction-following abilities.

- Evaluating multiple major model families (Flan-T5, GPT, Vicuna, OPT-IML) across varying sizes provides useful insights into how instruction-following performance differs across models and scales. Many previous studies evaluate just one or two models. 

- The analysis of results on natural vs neutral vs unnatural prompts offers evidence that while scaling improves performance on natural and neutral prompts, there are still limitations in overriding strong priors when prompts are highly unnatural. This emphasizes that continued progress is needed to improve robust instruction-following.

- The per-dataset and per-verbalizer analysis provides more fine-grained insights into when and why models fail on the unnatural prompts. The fact that even GPT-4 struggles highlights fundamental limitations.

- Exploring zero-shot chain of thought prompting extends the analysis into a promping technique designed to improve reasoning. The limitations persist even when models can show intermediate reasoning.

Overall, I think the systematic manipulation of verbalizers and prompts is a significant contribution over prior work, providing a new methodology for evaluating instruction-following. The comprehensive analysis across models, sizes, and datasets strengthens the conclusions that while scaling helps, there are still major limitations in instruction-following abilities even for the largest models like GPT-4. This emphasizes the need for continued progress on robust instruction-following capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop new methods to systematically and automatically evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of language models, beyond just accuracy on common benchmarks. The authors propose verbalizer manipulation as one such method, but suggest more work is needed in this area.

- Improve language models' ability to follow instructions that contradict their prior knowledge or training data. The authors show even large models like GPT-4 struggle on instructions with flipped label names. New methods are needed to make models more flexible. 

- Explore whether scaling up model size alone is sufficient to improve instruction-following, or if other changes like prompting techniques are needed. The authors find mixed results on whether larger models consistently perform better.

- Examine instruction-following abilities on a wider range of tasks beyond the classification benchmarks studied. The authors provide a breakdown of results by task type, indicating abilities may vary.

- Develop better techniques for models to verbalize their reasoning when following unnatural instructions, beyond just outputting a label. The zero-shot chain of thought prompting only partially helped models.

- Study what factors affect language models' prior knowledge and how it interacts with instruction-following. The authors suggest model family, scale, and pretraining data all may play a role.

In summary, the main suggestions are to develop new evaluation methods and model training techniques to improve instruction-following, especially on instructions that contradict priors. The authors emphasize this as an important direction for enabling real-world generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new evaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation to systematically assess the instruction-following capabilities of large language models. The key idea is to construct instructions that align with model priors to different extents by manipulating the verbalizer, which maps the true label to the target label name mentioned in the instruction. Verbalizers can be made natural (aligning with priors), neutral (unrelated to the task), or unnatural (contradicting priors). The authors evaluate four major model families - Flan-T5, GPT, Vicuna, OPT-IML - across varying sizes on 9 datasets with 12 verbalizer sets each. They find that while larger models generally perform better on natural and neutral instructions, performance on unnatural instructions varies significantly across models with no clear trend, indicating limitations in overriding priors. Even large models struggle on the most challenging unnatural verbalizers, performing at chance levels. The work highlights the need for advances in instruction-following capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel evaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation to systematically assess the instruction-following capabilities of large language models. The key idea is to evaluate models on instructions with different levels of alignment to their prior knowledge. Instructions are manipulated by changing the verbalizer, which maps the golden label to the word the model should output. Natural verbalizers align with priors, neutral verbalizers are unrelated, and unnatural verbalizers contradict priors. For example, on a sentiment classification task, "positive" and "negative" are natural, "foo" and "bar" are neutral, and flipping the labels produces unnatural verbalizers. By controlling the verbalizer, the authors can evaluate how well models follow instructions even when they conflict with priors. 

The authors evaluate major model families including Flan-T5, GPT, Vicuna, and OPT-IML on nine datasets with 12 verbalizer settings each. They find larger models generally perform better on natural and neutral instructions but diverge significantly on unnatural ones. Even GPT-4 struggles and performs near randomly on the most challenging unnatural verbalizer, emphasizing the need for continued progress. The framework provides an automatic way to assess instruction-following capabilities with minimal human effort. Evaluating models as verbalizers grow more unnatural illuminates differences in their abilities to override priors and follow instructions accurately.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel instruction-following evaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation to systematically examine the ability of instruction-tuned models to follow instructions that may not align with their learned priors. The key idea is to construct instructions with different verbalizers that align with model priors to varying extents. For a given classification dataset, verbalizers can be chosen to be highly aligned (e.g. "positive" for positive sentiment), minimally aligned (e.g. random words like "foo"), or contradictory (e.g. "negative" for positive sentiment) to model priors. By controlling the verbalizers, the authors can systematically construct instruction sets with different levels of naturalness - from natural, to neutral, to unnatural. They apply this verbalizer manipulation method to generate instruction variants for nine text classification datasets. Using these instruction sets, they comprehensively evaluate and compare four major families of instruction-tuned models across different scales. The results reveal interesting differences in how well different model families can follow instructions with decreasing levels of prior alignment, shedding light on their intrinsic instruction-following capabilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper seems to be addressing the challenge of accurately evaluating the instruction-following abilities of large language models that have been tuned on instructions. 

The key points are:

- Existing benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned models primarily use common instructions that align well with what the models learned during training. However, doing well on these instructions does not necessarily mean the models have strong instruction-following abilities.

- The authors propose a new evaluation protocol called "verbalizer manipulation" to construct instructions that align with model priors to different degrees - from highly aligned (natural), to minimally aligned (neutral), to contradicting priors (unnatural).

- This allows them to systematically examine how well models can follow instructions even when they do not align with the models' priors, in order to better evaluate their true instruction-following capabilities.

- The authors conduct experiments across different model families and scales to analyze their performance on instructions with varying degrees of alignment. 

- The results show even the strongest models struggle on the most challenging unnatural instructions, indicating there is significant room for improvement in instruction-following abilities.

In summary, the key problem is that existing benchmarks are limited in their ability to evaluate instruction-following, and the authors propose verbalizer manipulation as a way to create more diagnostic instructions for systematic evaluation. The goal is to better analyze and improve the instruction-following capabilities of large language models.
