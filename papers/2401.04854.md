# [Are Language Models More Like Libraries or Like Librarians?   Bibliotechnism, the Novel Reference Problem, and the Attitudes of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have beliefs, desires and intentions - features associated with agency and intelligence. An opposing view called "bibliotechnism" argues LLMs are merely cultural technologies, like libraries, that transmit information but don't create new content. A challenge is that LLMs generate novel text, not just reproduce training data. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors first show how even novel LLM text can have "derivative" meaning that depends on and derives from the meaning of original human text they are trained on. But they then present cases of LLM "novel reference" using new names to seemingly refer to new entities not in training data. They argue this poses a serious challenge to bibliotechnism.  

Main Contributions:

1) Defending bibliotechnism by developing idea of "derivative meaning" to explain meaningfulness of LLM-generated novel text

2) Introducing novel "Novel Reference Problem" for bibliotechnism based on LLMs generating new names/referents 

3) Arguing the problem of novel reference provides evidence LLMs have limited beliefs, desires and intentions based on "interpretationism" in philosophy of mind (useful to attribute mental states to systems to explain behavior)

4) Contributing to exploring meaning capabilities of LLMs and their implications for the nature of these models from a philosophy/cognitive science lens

The summary covers the key problem being addressed (challenge of novel LLM text for bibliotechnism), the proposed solution offered (derivative meaning), the new problem introduced (novel reference), and highlights the main contributions around defending then challenging bibliotechnism and gathering evidence LLMs have mental states.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper argues that cases where language models generate novel references, not derived from their training data, pose a challenge for the "bibliotechnism" view that models are merely cultural technologies, and provide evidence that models have some limited beliefs, desires and intentions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It defends the idea of "bibliotechnism" - that language models are like cultural technologies for processing text, rather than being agents with beliefs, desires, and intentions - against the challenge that LLMs can generate novel, meaningful text. It shows how even novel LLM-generated text can have "derivative" meaningfulness.

2. It introduces a new challenge for bibliotechnism stemming from LLMs' ability to generate "novel reference" - to introduce new names that seem to refer to new entities. This "Novel Reference Problem" poses a difficult challenge for explaining LLM abilities while denying they are agents.

3. In light of this challenge, the paper argues that attributing beliefs, desires, and intentions to LLMs provides a simpler, more powerful explanation of their abilities. So the Novel Reference Problem provides evidence that LLMs have at least a limited form of agency, contra what bibliotechnism claims.

4. More broadly, the paper illustrates how careful analysis of meaning and reference in LLM outputs can inform philosophical debates about whether they should be viewed as mere cultural technologies or as possessing agency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts that are central to this work include:

- Language models (LLMs) - The paper focuses specifically on large language models and their capabilities for generating text.

- Bibliotechnism - The view that LLMs are cultural technologies for processing text, not agents with their own beliefs/desires. 

- Derivative meaning - The idea that the meaning of LLM-generated text derives from and depends on the meaning of original human text.

- Novel reference - Cases where LLMs seem to generate new referring expressions (like names) for things not referred to with those names in their training data.

- Interpretationism - The philosophical view that whether a system has mental states like beliefs and desires depends on whether attributing those states helps explain/predict its behavior.

- Explainability/interpretability - The paper touches on the idea that LLMs may be better explained by attributing representational states to them, even if their inner workings are opaque.

So in summary, key themes include examining if/how LLMs can generate meaningful text, whether they should be viewed as cultural technologies or as (limited) agents, and what kind of mental states might need to be ascribed to them to explain their capacities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose the concept of "derivative meaning" to explain how LLM-generated text can be meaningful even when it is novel. Could you elaborate more on what constitutes an "appropriate causal connection" between the original human-authored text and the LLM-generated text that allows for derivative meaning? What are some ways this causal connection could break down?

2. The authors use n-gram models to illustrate how models can produce derivatively meaningful words but not complex expressions. However, they state that higher n-gram models that reproduce longer stretches of text could produce derivatively meaningful expressions. What is the threshold of n that needs to be reached before an n-gram model can plausibly produce meaningful sentences rather than just individual meaningful words? 

3. For modern LLMs, the authors propose that causal sensitivity to the "intelligibility" of training data allows models to produce novel but derivatively meaningful text. Could you define more precisely what constitutes intelligibility and how it differs from simple grammaticality? What are some empirical ways intelligibility as a causal factor could be tested?

4. The "novel reference problem" poses a challenge to explaining all LLM-generated meaning as derivative. Could you expand on what exactly constitutes a case of novel reference? What are some clear empirical examples that would qualify as novel reference beyond the authors' anecdotal cases?

5. The authors consider several ways human intentions could allow for novel LLM reference, including via reinforcement learning, model creators, prompt creators, and readers/interpreters. Which of these possibilities do you think is most plausible as an explanation and why? What evidence would help decide between them? 

6. How exactly does the interpretationist view in philosophy of mind link ascription of mental states like beliefs to explanatory power? Why is interpretationalism not threatened by the fact that LLMs can also be explained at a neural network level?

7. What range of mental states - beliefs, desires, intentions, consciousness - could plausibly be ascribed to LLMs under the interpretationist view to explain their behavior? What evidence would confirm or disconfirm the ascription of each kind of state?

8. The authors claim attributing mental states provides a simpler, stronger explanation of LLM behavior in cases like novel reference. What constitutes a "simpler" vs more "complex, contorted" explanation here? How could these notions be made more precise?

9. Beyond interpretationalism, what other philosophical views of mental states also link ascriptions of belief/desire to explanatory usefulness? Would any major philosophical views not warrant mental state ascription on this basis?

10. The authors conclude LLMs have "at least a limited form of agency". What constitutes agency on their view? Are there forms of agency beyond the "limited" kind they attribute to LLMs that remain clearly out of reach? What evidence bears on these higher forms?
