# [API Pack: A Massive Multilingual Dataset for API Call Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09615)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Developers often struggle to find appropriate API call code examples while coding, spending significant time sifting through lengthy documentation. Existing solutions are limited in scale and language diversity. 

Proposed Solution: The authors create API Pack, a massive multilingual dataset with over 1 million instruction-API call pairs across 10 languages. They leverage this to enhance large language models' API call generation capabilities.

Key Contributions:
- API Pack has unprecedented scale and programming language diversity compared to predecessors. It facilitates rigorously assessing generalization with controlled data volumes.
- Experiments demonstrate API Pack's efficacy - fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on just 20,000 Python examples yields over 10% and 5% higher accuracy for unseen API calls than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively. 
- Increasing data to 100k Python instances improves generalization to new APIs, confirming larger datasets have advantages.
- Cross-lingual skill transfer for API calls is feasible without requiring huge data per language. Fine-tuning with ample data from one language plus little data from others works decently.
- Combining API Pack and existing instruction datasets boosts API call generation over 35% while maintaining overall coding proficiency.

The key goal is transforming developers' ability to leverage natural language to find API call examples, maximizing productivity. The results validate API Pack's ability to enhance large language models in this specialized domain without hindering their general coding abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of this paper's contributions:

This paper introduces API Pack, a large-scale multi-lingual dataset for API call generation, and shows it can enhance large language models' capabilities to produce API call code from natural language instructions, while maintaining their general proficiency at coding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of API Pack, a massive multilingual dataset with over 1 million instruction-API call pairs aimed at advancing large language models' capabilities in API call generation. The paper demonstrates API Pack's efficacy in enhancing models like CodeLlama-13B for this specialized task while maintaining overall proficiency at general coding. Key results include:

- Fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on just 20,000 Python instances yields over 10% and 5% higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively for generating unseen API calls. 

- Scaling the instruction data to 100,000 Python instances improves generalization to new APIs not seen during training, confirming the benefits of a larger dataset.

- Cross-lingual API call generation can be achieved by fine-tuning models on a large amount of data in one language plus small amounts of data from other languages. An excessive amount of data per target programming language is not crucial.

The paper also evaluates combining API Pack with other instruction datasets, showing improved API call generation without affecting code generation performance on benchmarks. Overall, API Pack is presented as a way to enhance models' API call capabilities while maintaining broad proficiency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions generating instruction candidates using an LLM prompt. What considerations went into designing an effective prompt to produce high-quality instructions? How was the prompt iterated upon and refined?

2. Data validation involved removing instructions with errors like incorrect API names. What techniques were used to automatically detect these errors? Were rules hand-engineered or learned from data? 

3. For the scaling experiment, what motivated choosing the specific dataset sizes of 20k, 40k, 80k and 100k? Was there an optimization strategy to identify the best sizes?

4. In the cross-lingual experiment, what informed the choice of using 1000 instances for the additional 9 languages? Was there any experimentation done with more or less data per language? 

5. The integration experiment combined API Pack with existing instruction datasets. What considerations went into determining the subset amount and content from API Pack? Were certain types of instances prioritized?

6. How was the sequence matcher threshold of 0.9 determined for evaluating API call generation accuracy? Was there an ablation study done to validate this number?

7. For the retrieval augmentation experiments, how were the retrieval and reranking models selected? Was there any comparison with alternate retrieval pipelines?

8. The paper focuses on instruction-following for API call generation. Are there plans to extend this capability to broader tasks like debugging or program synthesis? If so, what modifications would be needed?

9. The limitations mention challenges with unsupported or incomplete user queries. Are there plans to build capabilities to handle these cases by inferring missing details? What methods could help address this?

10. To scale up multi-API call scenarios, what algorithmic innovations or dataset augmentations would likely be needed? Could the current approach be combined with modular programming techniques?
