# [AIGIQA-20K: A Large Database for AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- With the rapid advancements in AI-generated content (AIGC), there is a need for robust quality assessment models that match human perception of AI-generated images (AIGIs).  
- Existing image quality assessment (IQA) models focus on natural images and don't apply well to AIGIs which have different distortion attributes related to model architecture and training.
- Previous AIGI quality databases are limited in scale and coverage of generative models, hyperparameter configurations, and subjective ratings.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a large-scale, fine-grained AIGI quality database called AIGIQA-20K with 20K images from 15 text-to-image models.
- Dynamically adjust classifier-free guidance, iteration epochs and image resolution during generation to cover diverse quality ranges.  
- Collect 420K subjective quality ratings from 21 subjects considering both perceptual quality and text-to-image alignment.
- Benchmark performance of 16 IQA and text-to-image alignment metrics on predicting subjective scores.

Main Contributions:
- AIGIQA-20K - the largest fine-grained subjective quality database of AI-generated images to date with coverage of more models and configurations.
- Comprehensive analysis of factors impacting subjective quality of AIGIs based on ratings, including model architecture, text prompt length and training configurations.  
- Extensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art quality and alignment metrics, showing need for more accurate zero-shot estimators aligned with human perception.
- The database and analysis provide a valuable resource for future research into robust AIGI quality assessment aligned with subjective human preferences.

In summary, the paper introduces a large-scale subjective quality database for AI-generated images to facilitate research into robust quality assessment models closely matching human perception in this rapidly evolving space.
