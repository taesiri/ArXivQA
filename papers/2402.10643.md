# [`Keep it Together': Enforcing Cohesion in Extractive Summaries by   Simulating Human Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10643)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extractive summaries usually lack cohesion as they are just concatenations of sentences. Previous work has focused more on controlling for informativeness and redundancy.
- Cohesion relies on explicit textual connections called "cohesive ties" between concepts, which makes a text read as a unified whole.

Proposed Solution:
- A summarization pipeline that has two control mechanisms - one to control redundancy during input text understanding, and another to control the tradeoff between informativeness and cohesion during summary extraction.
- The input text is split into blocks which are selected iteratively based on relevance and redundancy with already selected blocks. This reduces redundancy for the later modules.
- Sentences are then selected incrementally to build the summary by balancing informativeness score from an encoder model and cohesion score from a separate model based on the Kintsch and van Dijk (KvD) theory of human text comprehension. 
- The KvD model tracks "lexical chains" of related noun phrases to enforce cohesive ties between sentences during extraction. It simulates working memory to focus only on recent chains.

Main Contributions:
- A cascaded pipeline with explicit control mechanisms to balance redundancy, informativeness and cohesion
- KvD-Select sentence extraction module that simulates human memory and builds lexical chains to improve summary cohesion  
- Experiments across domains like scientific articles, patents etc. showing the pipeline is effective at controlling properties and allowing configurable tradeoffs
- Human evaluation revealing improved cohesion results in higher perceived informativeness, with chains connecting adjacent sentences for smooth topic flow
