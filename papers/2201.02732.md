# C2-CRS: Coarse-to-Fine Contrastive Learning for Conversational   Recommender System

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively leverage multi-type external data to improve conversational recommender systems (CRS). Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:1) There is a semantic gap between conversation data and external data due to their different forms (e.g. utterances vs knowledge graphs) and content (e.g. utterances vs reviews). 2) It is difficult to capture multi-grained user preferences across different data types, as user preferences may be reflected differently in various semantic units like words, entities, sentences, etc.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel coarse-to-fine contrastive learning approach to gradually fuse the representations of multi-type external data to enhance the limited conversation context. The key hypothesis is that by extracting and aligning multi-grained semantic units from different data signals in a coarse-to-fine manner, the model can learn more coherent fused representations to improve CRS performance.In summary, the central research question is how to effectively incorporate multi-type external data to improve CRS by bridging the semantic gap and learning multi-grained representations. The proposal is a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning approach for multi-grained semantic fusion across data types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel coarse-to-fine contrastive learning framework to leverage multi-type external data (conversation history, knowledge graphs, reviews) to improve conversational recommender systems (CRS). 2. It introduces both coarse-grained and fine-grained contrastive learning procedures to gradually fuse different semantic spaces in a multi-grained manner. The coarse-grained learning focuses on general user preferences while the fine-grained learning focuses on specific user preferences.3. It develops optimization objectives for coarse- and fine-grained fusion in a unified form of contrastive learning, which pulls semantically associated units together and pushes apart irrelevant ones. 4. It designs suitable recommendation and conversation modules based on the pre-trained representations for accomplishing CRS tasks.5. Experiments on two public CRS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both recommendation and conversation tasks.In summary, the key novelty lies in the coarse-to-fine contrastive learning framework to effectively fuse multi-type external data in a multi-grained manner, which helps improve the performance of conversational recommender systems.
