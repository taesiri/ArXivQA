# [Autonomous Docking Method via Non-linear Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16629)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of autonomous docking for personal mobility vehicles (PMVs) such as electric wheelchairs. Achieving autonomous docking is an important capability for autonomous vehicles to allow self-charging.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach with visual servoing feedback for autonomous docking. 
- An onboard camera detects ArUco markers to provide real-time pose feedback to the NMPC controller. The controller generates optimal trajectories to drive the vehicle from its current pose to achieve the desired docking position and orientation.

Contributions:
- Derivation of kinematic model for the PMV as the predictive model in the NMPC formulation.
- Design of a NMPC controller with cost functions to achieve position accuracy and heading angle accuracy for docking.
- Use of ArUco marker detection and position-based visual servoing to provide real-time feedback on vehicle and target dock pose.
- Implementation in simulation and experiments to evaluate controller performance for various docking scenarios with position and angle deviations.
- Demonstrated average position error of 0.0021 m and heading error of 0.00038 degrees, meeting accuracy requirements.

In summary, the key contribution is an NMPC with visual servoing control approach for autonomous docking of personal mobility vehicles. Experiments demonstrate its ability to achieve precise docking control meeting requirements on positioning and orientation accuracy.
