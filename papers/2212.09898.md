# [MetaCLUE: Towards Comprehensive Visual Metaphors Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09898)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a set of tasks (called MetaCLUE) for comprehensive research on visual metaphors, including classification, localization, understanding, and generation. 

2. Creating a dataset of metaphor annotations (objects, concepts, relationships, boxes) to facilitate evaluation on these tasks, as no such dataset previously existed.

3. Performing a detailed experimental analysis to evaluate state-of-the-art computer vision and language models on the proposed tasks using the collected annotations.

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that current models still struggle with deeper understanding and generation of metaphorical images, despite advances in literal image tasks. The authors introduce MetaCLUE and accompanying annotations to systematically probe and advance research in this direction. The comprehensive experiments highlight limitations of existing techniques, laying groundwork for future research.

The key novelty seems to be proposing this set of tasks tailored to metaphors and constructing corresponding annotations to enable measurable progress, as opposed to just metaphor detection/classification alone. The annotations also capture richer aspects like relationships and bounding boxes that are critical for metaphor comprehension.
