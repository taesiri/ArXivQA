# [BERT-Enhanced Retrieval Tool for Homework Plagiarism Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Detecting plagiarism for homework assignments is important but challenging, especially for more complex forms like paraphrasing the original ideas.  
- Lack of high-quality datasets for training plagiarism detection models.

Proposed Solution:
- Used GPT-3.5 to generate a dataset of 32,927 text pairs covering diverse plagiarism strategies like synonym replacement, rewriting structure etc. This helps address the dataset limitation.

- Proposed a two-stage plagiarism identification framework:
   1) Use FAISS with SBERT embeddings for fast candidate retrieval 
   2) Feed retrieved pairs to a fine-tuned BERT classifier to identify no/imitation/shuffle plagiarism

Main Contributions:

- Novel GPT-3.5 based method to generate a large and diverse new dataset for plagiarism detection

- Accuracy plagiarism identification framework combining efficient FAISS based retrieval and accurate BERT based classifier

- Performance exceeds prior benchmarks - accuracy of 98.86%, precision 98.90%, recall 98.86% and F1 score of 0.9888

- User friendly demo for text library upload and visual plagiarism analysis

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative data augmentation approach using LLMs to create a new plagiarism dataset. It also proposes a fast yet accurate two-stage framework for plagiarism detection that outperforms previous methods. The results and demo showcase the promise of this solution.
