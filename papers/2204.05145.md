# [Focal Length and Object Pose Estimation via Render and Compare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the problem of jointly estimating the 6D pose (3D rotation and translation) of a known 3D object model and the unknown focal length of the camera given a single RGB image depicting that object. Solving this is challenging because changes in focal length and object depth can have similar effects on the image, so they are coupled and hard to disentangle. Prior render-and-compare methods for 6D pose estimation assume the camera parameters are fixed and known, which is often not the case for consumer photos.

Proposed Solution
The paper proposes FocalPose, a novel render-and-compare approach to jointly estimate the focal length and 6D pose. It extends an existing state-of-the-art 6D pose estimator (CosyPose) by deriving differentiable update rules to iteratively refine the focal length and pose parameters. Two main contributions are:

1. Focal length update rule: Uses an exponential update to ensure the focal length remains positive, while allowing efficient gradient-based learning.

2. Disentangled loss function: Combines a direct focal length regression loss with a novel disentangled reprojection loss that separates the effects of errors in translation, rotation and focal length for faster convergence.

The refined estimates are produced by a refinement network that compares the current rendered view to the input image and predicts parameter updates to align them better. The network is trained end-to-end using rendered RGB images with ground truth poses and focal lengths.

Experiments show the approach outperforms prior methods on 3 datasets with perspective effects and focal length variation. Particularly large improvements are achieved on estimating the focal length and 3D translation, demonstrating it successfully handles the coupling between them.

Main Contributions
- First render-and-compare method to jointly estimate object 6D pose and unknown camera focal length 
- Novel differentiable update rules for focal length in this setting
- Disentangled loss function that improves training convergence and handling of focal length/depth ambiguity
- State-of-the-art results on datasets with focal length variation 

The main limitation is the method can get stuck in local minima for symmetric objects or fail for incorrect 3D models. Overall, it enables rendering graphics aligned to objects in images with unknown intrinsic parameters.
