# [ACT-SQL: In-Context Learning for Text-to-SQL with   Automatically-Generated Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17342)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for the text-to-SQL task through in-context learning. The authors study different prompting strategies to activate the reasoning abilities of LLMs when generating SQL queries. They introduce a novel approach called ACT-SQL that automatically generates chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to guide the LLM's reasoning process. ACT-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Spider dataset among in-context learning methods, while only requiring a single API call to generate each SQL query. The authors find that factors like database schema representation, exemplar selection, and CoT prompt design impact LLM performance. Beyond single-turn text-to-SQL, they extend ACT-SQL to multi-turn datasets like SParC and CoSQL by using the LLM to rewrite context-dependent questions. Overall, this work demonstrates that carefully-designed prompts can unlock strong text-to-SQL abilities in LLMs without extensive finetuning. The ACT-SQL approach provides an efficient and high-performing method for leveraging LLMs' reasoning capacity for this complex task.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores in-context learning methods for the text-to-SQL task using large language models (LLMs). The authors study the influence of different database schema prompt styles and few-shot exemplar selection strategies on the LLMs' performance. They propose an approach called ACT-SQL to automatically generate a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt that guides the LLM's reasoning when generating SQL queries. The ACT-SQL approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among in-context learning methods on the Spider dataset while only requiring a single API call to the LLM per query. The authors also extend ACT-SQL to multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets like SParC and CoSQL, where it achieves comparable performance to fine-tuned models. Overall, the work demonstrates the capabilities of in-context learning for text-to-SQL and provides methods to effectively prompt LLMs to reason through the generation process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes ACT-SQL, an in-context learning method that automatically generates chain-of-thought prompts to improve text-to-SQL performance of large language models like GPT-3.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can large language models like GPT-3 be effectively leveraged for the text-to-SQL task using prompt engineering techniques like chain-of-thought prompting?

The authors aim to show that with well-designed prompting strategies like their proposed ACT-SQL approach, large language models can achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Their experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the Spider text-to-SQL dataset among in-context learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors explore the influence on LLMs' performance under the text-to-SQL task with different prompting styles and few-shot exemplar selection strategies.

2. The authors propose an approach called ACT-SQL to automatically generate chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. Experiments show ACT-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing in-context learning methods on the Spider dataset while being more time and cost efficient. 

3. The authors extend their in-context learning method to multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets including SParC and CoSQL and achieve comparable accuracy scores to finetuned models.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed ACT-SQL approach for automatically generating CoT prompts to improve LLM performance on text-to-SQL tasks in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The method is evaluated on single-turn and multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in text-to-SQL with large language models:

- This paper proposes an approach called ACT-SQL that uses automatically generated chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 for the text-to-SQL task. Other recent works like Rajkumar et al. use more simplistic prompting without CoT, while Pourreza et al.'s DIN-SQL has a more complex workflow but requires multiple API calls. 

- The ACT-SQL approach only requires a single API call to the LLM to generate each SQL query, making it faster and cheaper than methods requiring multiple calls like DIN-SQL.

- Experiments show ACT-SQL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among in-context learning methods on the Spider dataset, outperforming past approaches from Rajkumar et al. and others. The performance is comparable to fine-tuned models.

- This work also extends the in-context learning approach to multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets like SParC and CoSQL, where most prior work has focused on single-turn Spider. The accuracy is comparable to fine-tuned models on multi-turn datasets as well.

- Overall, this paper demonstrates improved prompting strategies for LLMs on text-to-SQL using automatic CoT generation. The single-call design is more efficient than prior work, and the accuracy reaches new SOTA for in-context learning on Spider and extends effectively to multi-turn datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Improving the quality of the rewritten questions when applying their approach to multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets. The authors note that errors in the rewritten questions can negatively impact performance.

- Further exploration of using their approach on multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets like SParC and CoSQL. The authors were only able to achieve comparable but not superior performance compared to fine-tuned models on these datasets. There is room for improvement.

- Investigating other strategies for exemplar selection beyond their hybrid static and dynamic exemplar approach. The number and selection method for exemplars are hyperparameters in their model.

- Applying their auto-CoT method to other complex reasoning tasks beyond text-to-SQL. The authors suggest the CoT method is well-suited for tasks that require complex logical reasoning.

In summary, the main future work is improving performance on multi-turn text-to-SQL datasets, researching exemplar selection strategies, and extending the approach to other logical reasoning tasks.
