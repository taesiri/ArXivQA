# [Classist Tools: Social Class Correlates with Performance in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important factor affecting language use and identity, as shown in sociolinguistics research. However, SES is rarely considered in NLP systems.
- The paper investigates whether NLP systems exhibit biases related to SES, potentially disadvantaging speakers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. 

Methodology:
- The authors create a new dataset of 95K utterances from movie/TV show scripts, labeled with metadata including socioeconomic class, race, and geographical variety.
- They evaluate NLP system performance across tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and grammar error correction, analyzing differences by speaker SES.

Key Findings:
- Speech recognition systems like Wav2Vec2 have higher word error rates for lower SES and non-white speakers.
- Language models like Mistral-7B assign higher perplexity (lower expectability) to sentences from lower class speakers.
- Grammar error correction models like Flan-T5 propose more corrections for lower SES speakers, sometimes "correcting" non-standard language varieties. 

Main Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates NLP performance disparities correlated with socioeconomic status, beyond just race and geography.
- Argues for actively incorporating SES as a variable into NLP systems to make them more equitable.
- Releases a new multi-modal dataset labeled for socioeconomic class to enable further research.

The paper makes a case that overlooking socioeconomic diversity in language risks further marginalizing less privileged populations. The authors advocate addressing this gap by improving NLP systems to work equally well across different socioeconomic language varieties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper shows empirically that the performance of NLP systems on language modeling, speech recognition, and grammar correction tasks correlates with and disadvantages speakers from lower socioeconomic status, as well as certain ethnicities and regional dialects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors construct a corpus of 95K utterances from English-language television shows and movies, annotated with information about the socioeconomic status, race, and geographic variety (UK vs US) of the speakers.

2) Using this corpus, the authors empirically show that socioeconomic status has a measurable impact on the performance of several NLP systems, including models for language modeling, automatic speech recognition, and grammar error correction. Specifically, they find that models tend to perform worse on language from lower socioeconomic status speakers.

3) The authors argue that socioeconomic status is an important variable that has been overlooked in considering fairness and bias in NLP systems. They suggest that researchers should incorporate information about socioeconomic status into their models and datasets in order to make NLP systems more equitable.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating empirically, using a newly constructed corpus, that NLP system performance correlates with socioeconomic status. This highlights issues of fairness and the need to better account for socioeconomic diversity in NLP systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Social class
- Socioeconomic status (SES) 
- Sociolinguistics
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Bias
- Performance disparities
- Language varieties
- Marginalized groups
- Sociolects
- Automated speech recognition (ASR)
- Language modeling 
- Perplexity
- Grammar error correction
- Identity formation

The paper examines how NLP systems display biases related to social class and socioeconomic status. It draws on concepts from sociolinguistics to study differences in language use across groups with different SES. The key goal is to empirically demonstrate that NLP performance varies depending on the language variety used by different socioeconomic groups. Concepts like perplexity, ASR, and grammar error correction are used to quantify performance disparities that disadvantage marginalized socioeconomic groups. Overall, the paper argues for greater awareness of how social class impacts NLP system behavior and performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The authors manually annotated a dataset of movie and TV show transcripts for social class, ethnicity, and geographical language variety. What are some limitations or potential issues with using fictional media content for analyzing real-world sociolinguistic phenomena? How could the validity of this approach be further evaluated?

2. The authors measured several lexical and syntactic features to capture differences between social classes, but these did not work well. However, TF-IDF representations did achieve higher performance in predicting social class. Why might surface-level lexical features not capture socioeconomic differences effectively in this conversational dataset?  

3. The study found lower ASR error rates for higher SES groups and white speakers. Could this finding partly reflect real linguistic differences in enunciation/clarity between groups? Or is it more likely to simply indicate biases in the models? How could this be further analyzed?  

4. For the language modeling experiments, why did the authors exclude turns shorter than 5 words? Could important socioeconomic differences manifest in very short turns as well? How could short turns be effectively analyzed?

5. In analyzing language model perplexity, why did clearer SES-based differences only emerge once race was also accounted for? What does this suggest about the interplay between race and class in language?

6. For the grammar error correction experiments, what are some possible reasons that lower SES speech was more likely to be “corrected”? Does this definitely indicate a bias, or could lower SES speech legitimately contain more grammatical errors?

7. The grammar error correction examples show changes that eliminate regional slang terms. Should these be considered errors by an NLP system? What philosophy of language should guide developing grammar correction systems?  

8. The paper argues we should incorporate social class as a variable in NLP systems for fairness. However, predicting social class also enables profiling speakers. How can we balance fairness and privacy concerns here?

9. The fictional media dataset enabled analyzing social class differences without privacy issues. However, artificially constructed language may not fully reflect authentic sociolects. How else could an analysis like this be conducted with natural language? What would be the tradeoffs?

10. The study was limited to English and group-based analysis. How could analyzing individual-level differences in other languages help strengthen and expand on these findings? What additional socioeconomic indicators might be relevant for other languages/cultures?
