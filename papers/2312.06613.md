# [Neural Text to Articulate Talk: Deep Text to Audiovisual Speech   Synthesis achieving both Auditory and Photo-realism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06613)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents NEUTART, a novel method for photorealistic, text-driven audiovisual speech synthesis. The model uses a joint audiovisual feature space and transformer architecture to translate text into synchronized speech audio and video of a realistic virtual talking head. Unlike prior cascaded approaches, NEUTART avoids redundant speech representations and directly models the complex interplay of vocal and visual elements inherent in natural speech. For visual generation, 3D morphable face models and a conditional GAN renderer enable photorealistic rendering of detailed facial motions matched to the text. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with both objective metrics and human evaluation confirming enhanced realism and plausibility compared to previous methods. The work represents an important advance in multimodal AI, with potential applications in digital avatars, accessibility tools, and human-computer interaction. Ethical concerns are discussed regarding the synthesis of realistic virtual videos without consent.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-driven talking face generation is important for applications like digital avatars and virtual assistants, but is underrepresented in research compared to audio-driven lip syncing models.  
- Existing text-driven models have limitations:
     - Cascaded 2-stage models of TTS + audio-driven talking face generator are redundant and ignore audiovisual correlations.
     - Models focusing only on visual speech lack audio consistency and synchronization.  
     - State-of-the-art text-driven audiovisual models have slow autoregressive architectures or oversimplify facial motions.
     - No existing text-driven method has achieved photorealism for free-form videos.

Proposed Solution:
- Present NEUTART - the first text-driven, photorealistic audiovisual speech synthesizer with a joint audiovisual architecture.
- Key ideas:
     - Avoid cascaded approach by having joint intermediate features from text conditioned on both audio and visual losses 
     - Capture complex audiovisual correlations in speech  
     - Detailed 3D face modeling with FLAME parameters 
     - Photorealistic video synthesis with neural renderer and GANs
- Two modules trained separately:
     1) Audiovisual module: 
          - Encoder-decoder transformer architecture 
          - Maps text to mel spectrogram, FLAME parameters
          - Audio loss, multiple specialized visual losses
     2) Photo-realistic module
          - Neural renderer conditioned on FLAME shape and texture
          - Generates video frames that match input text

Main Contributions:
- First text-driven photo-realistic audiovisual speech synthesizer with joint architecture
- Novel joint modeling of audio and 3D facial elements coupled through losses
- State-of-the-art photo-realistic video synthesis integrated through FLAME and neural renderer
- Qualitative and quantitative experiments showing improved realism over previous state-of-the-art
- Significant preferences over other methods in user study
- Makes models and code publicly available

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed NEUTART method and its important capabilities, the two-module architecture with specialized losses, and the main contributions of the work in advancing text-driven photorealistic talking face generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel text-driven audiovisual speech synthesis method called NEUTART that uses Transformers and joint audiovisual modeling to generate photorealistic talking face videos with natural head movements and lip synchronization from text, without needing a cascaded text-to-speech and audio-to-video pipeline.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, text-driven, photo-realistic audiovisual speech synthesizer that is genuinely bimodal and avoids the cascaded 2-stage approaches adopted by previous methods. 

2) It proposes a novel joint modeling of acoustic and 3D visual elements in a learned feature space, which captures the complex interplay between audio and visual streams. This increases the perceived realism and plausibility of the final synthetic result.

3) It adopts a detailed 3D representation for the synthesis of visual speech and combines it with state-of-the-art photo-realistic video synthesis based on conditional GANs. This allows blending the synthesized facial motions with complex, challenging scenes in a completely photo-realistic manner.

4) It conducts qualitative and quantitative experiments, user and ablation studies to evaluate the method and compare it with recent state-of-the-art methods. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, which achieves particularly promising results in challenging scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of the first text-driven, photo-realistic, and genuinely bimodal audiovisual speech synthesizer, along with experiments showing its effectiveness over previous approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Text-driven audiovisual speech synthesis: The paper focuses on synthesizing talking faces and speech audio directly from text input, without needing an audio signal.

- Transformers: The proposed model, NEUTART, makes use of transformer architectures for both the text encoding and audio/visual decoding.

- FastSpeech 2: The audiovisual module builds upon the FastSpeech 2 text-to-speech model.

- 3D Morphable Face Model: The visual speech is modeled using the FLAME 3D face model, which represents faces in terms of pose, shape, and expression parameters.  

- Conditional GANs: A conditional generative adversarial network is used in the photo-realistic module to render realistic facial imagery.

- Joint audiovisual representation: A key aspect is the use of a shared representation between the audio and visual modalities, avoiding a cascaded or two-stage approach.

- Lipreading loss: A perceptual loss from a lipreading model is used to improve visual speech quality.

- Photorealistic talking faces: The overall aim is to synthesize photo-realistic videos of talking heads from text.
