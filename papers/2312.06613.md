# [Neural Text to Articulate Talk: Deep Text to Audiovisual Speech   Synthesis achieving both Auditory and Photo-realism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06613)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents NEUTART, a novel method for photorealistic, text-driven audiovisual speech synthesis. The model uses a joint audiovisual feature space and transformer architecture to translate text into synchronized speech audio and video of a realistic virtual talking head. Unlike prior cascaded approaches, NEUTART avoids redundant speech representations and directly models the complex interplay of vocal and visual elements inherent in natural speech. For visual generation, 3D morphable face models and a conditional GAN renderer enable photorealistic rendering of detailed facial motions matched to the text. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with both objective metrics and human evaluation confirming enhanced realism and plausibility compared to previous methods. The work represents an important advance in multimodal AI, with potential applications in digital avatars, accessibility tools, and human-computer interaction. Ethical concerns are discussed regarding the synthesis of realistic virtual videos without consent.
