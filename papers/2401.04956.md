# [EmMixformer: Mix transformer for eye movement recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing eye movement recognition approaches either use handcrafted features with machine learning models or CNN-based models. Handcrafted features rely on assumptions that do not effectively model complex real-world distributions of eye movement data. CNNs fail to capture long-range temporal dependencies in sequential eye movement data. Recently, transformers have shown impressive performance in capturing long-range dependencies but have not been explored for eye movement recognition.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel mixed transformer model called EmMixformer for eye movement recognition. It consists of three main modules - Transformer, Attention LSTM, and Fourier Transformer.

- Transformer module applies self-attention on the eye movement sequence to capture long-term temporal dependencies. 

- Attention LSTM incorporates an attention mechanism into LSTM to learn short-term temporal dependencies within the sequence.

- Fourier Transformer module transforms the sequence into the frequency domain and performs self-attention to learn global feature dependencies.

The combination of these three modules allows EmMixformer to learn comprehensive time-series feature representations of eye movements by capturing both long and short-range temporal dependencies as well as global feature dependencies.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first Transformer model for eye movement recognition task to capture long temporal dependencies using self-attention.

- Introduces Attention LSTM module that incorporates attention into LSTM to improve learning of short-term dependencies.

- Develops Fourier Transformer module applying self-attention in frequency domain to learn global features. 

- Combined model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three eye movement datasets, achieving lowest equal error rates.

- Releases a new challenging eye movement dataset using low-cost portable tracker without head stabilization to promote benchmarking.

In summary, the key novelty is in proposing a mixed Transformer to jointly learn local temporal, global temporal, and global feature dependencies within eye movement sequences for improved biometric recognition performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning model called EmMixformer that combines transformer, attention LSTM, and Fourier transformer modules to extract complementary time-domain and frequency-domain features from eye movement data for biometric authentication.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel mix transformer named EmMixformer for eye movement recognition, which includes three modules - transformer, attention LSTM, and Fourier transformer. This is the first attempt to use transformer for eye movement recognition.

2. Designing an attention LSTM module to learn robust temporal dependencies by incorporating attention mechanism into LSTM. 

3. Proposing a Fourier transformer module to learn global dependencies by performing self attention in the frequency domain. This is the first transformer performing frequency domain learning.

4. Building a new challenging eye tracking dataset using a portable eye tracker under more realistic conditions without chin rest.

5. Conducting extensive experiments on the new dataset and two public datasets, showing that EmMixformer outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves the lowest verification errors.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the EmMixformer model for eye movement recognition, which leverages transformer's capacity to capture long-range dependencies and global dependencies in both time and frequency domains for robust feature representation. This allows EmMixformer to achieve new state-of-the-art results on eye movement recognition.
