# [Task-Agnostic Graph Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08335)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop tools to explain graph neural network (GNN) models in cases where:

1) The GNN model performs multi-task prediction, i.e. makes predictions for multiple downstream tasks. 

2) The GNN model is trained in a self-supervised manner without any downstream tasks defined, and the resulting representations are later used for downstream tasks.

Existing learning-based GNN explanation methods are task-specific, meaning they need to be trained separately for each prediction task. This makes them inefficient for explaining multi-task models, where a separate explainer would be needed for each task. They also cannot be applied in case 2 above, where no downstream tasks are defined during training. 

To address these limitations, the paper proposes a task-agnostic explanation framework called TAGE that:

- Decomposes the prediction model into an embedding model and separate downstream models.

- Learns a single embedding explainer in a self-supervised manner without knowledge of downstream tasks. 

- Allows the embedding explainer to cooperate with lightweight downstream explainers to provide explanations.

The key hypothesis is that this task-agnostic approach will enable explaining multi-task models efficiently with a single embedding explainer, as well as explaining self-supervised GNN models where downstream tasks are initially unknown.

In summary, the paper focuses on developing a task-agnostic explanation framework that can handle multi-task prediction and self-supervised GNN models, overcoming the limitations of prior task-specific explanation methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a task-agnostic graph neural network explanation framework called TAGE that can efficiently provide high quality explanations for graph neural networks in cases where multiple downstream tasks need to be explained or the downstream tasks are unknown during model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is an overview of how it compares to other research in the field of graph neural network explainability:

- Main Contribution: The paper proposes a novel task-agnostic explanation framework called TAGE. Unlike prior explainers like GNNExplainer or PGExplainer which require training separate models for each prediction task, TAGE can provide explanations for multiple downstream tasks using a single pretrained explainer. 

- Key Differences from Prior Work:

1) TAGE is trained in a self-supervised manner without needing labeled data or knowledge of downstream tasks. This enables explaining models trained with unlabeled data or future unseen tasks.

2) TAGE decomposes the explanation into an embedding explainer and lightweight downstream explainers. The embedding explainer is task-agnostic while the downstream explainer adapts to the task.

3) The embedding explainer is trained with a novel conditioned contrastive learning objective that maximizes mutual information between original and subgraph embeddings.

- Evaluation: Experiments on real-world molecular, protein, and e-commerce graphs demonstrate TAGE matches or outperforms task-specific explainers in fidelity while achieving significantly better efficiency and universality.

- Limitations: TAGE relies on access to node embeddings. Explaining black-box models where only outputs are observable remains an open challenge. The inductive training may suffer from dataset bias.

In summary, TAGE introduces a new task-agnostic explanation paradigm with solid empirical results. The idea of disentangling embedding and task-specific explainers enables explaining unseen tasks. The approach contrasts with prior work focused on developing task-specific explainers or optimization methods. However, black-box explanation and inductive bias issues remain open challenges.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing explainers for black-box models where only the output is available. The current explainer relies on node embeddings as input, so it cannot easily explain models where the internal representations are not accessible. The authors suggest exploring methods like surrogate models or other ways to represent nodes to enable explaining black-box models.

- Improving the expressiveness and flexibility of the explainer architecture. For very complex models/tasks/datasets, the current embedding explainer may need more parameters and modifications to provide sufficiently good task-specific explanations. The authors suggest ideas like fine-tuning or using more expressive task-specific explainers where needed.

- Addressing potential dataset bias issues with inductive learning. Since the explainer is trained on a dataset and applied to new data, there could be mismatches that affect the quality of explanations. Further research could investigate this issue and develop techniques to reduce the effects of dataset bias.

- Extending the approach to additional graph explanation scenarios like node classification or link prediction. The current work focuses on graph and node classification tasks. Expanding the framework to other common graph ML tasks could be an interesting direction.

- Considering alternative learning objectives and training frameworks. The self-supervised conditioned contrastive learning approach is key to enabling task-agnostic training, but other objectives could be explored as well.

- Evaluating the approach on more diverse and complex real-world datasets. Testing on additional challenging molecular, biological, social network, etc. datasets would further demonstrate the capabilities.

- Comparing to a wider range of graph explanation methods, especially more recent work. More extensive comparisons on explanation quality and efficiency would better situate the performance.

So in summary, the authors point to a number of promising ways to extend the task-agnostic graph explanation framework to broader models, tasks, datasets, and training objectives. Addressing limitations and expanding evaluation are also noted as important future directions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the task-agnostic explanation problem and proposes a two-stage explanation pipeline involving an embedding explainer and a downstream explainer. This enables explaining multiple downstream tasks with a single embedding explainer. 

2. It proposes a self-supervised training framework called TAGE (Task-Agnostic Graph Explainer) to train the embedding explainer without knowledge of downstream tasks. The training uses conditioned contrastive learning objectives.

3. It demonstrates through experiments that TAGE can achieve higher explanation quality compared to learning-based baselines like GNNExplainer and PGExplainer. It also shows significant speedups in explanation efficiency by using a single explainer for multiple tasks.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing the task-agnostic explanation setting and a method to train an embedding explainer in a self-supervised manner that can cooperate with any downstream explainer/task. This provides benefits like enabling explanations when downstream tasks are unavailable and allowing efficient explanation of multitask models with a single explainer.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Task-Agnostic Graph Explanations (TAGE), a new method for explaining graph neural network (GNN) models in a task-agnostic manner. The key idea is to decompose the prediction model into an embedding model and downstream model, and train separate explainers for each. The embedding explainer is trained under self-supervision with no knowledge of downstream tasks, enabling it to explain the embeddings regardless of the specific prediction task. The downstream explainer cooperates with the embedding explainer to provide task-specific explanations. This allows a single embedding explainer to explain multiple downstream tasks efficiently. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TAGE achieves higher explanation quality and efficiency compared to existing task-specific explanation methods like GNNExplainer and PGExplainer. A key advantage is the ability to explain multitask models with a single embedding explainer. The proposed TAGE framework advances the field of explainable AI by enabling task-agnostic explanations for GNNs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a task-agnostic graph neural network explanation framework called TAGE. TAGE aims to address limitations of current explainers which require training individual explainers for each prediction task. The key ideas are: 1) Decomposing the prediction model into an embedding model and downstream models. 2) Training a universal embedding explainer using self-supervision on node/graph embeddings, without requiring any downstream tasks. 3) Using lightweight downstream explainers to provide task-specific importance scores that serve as conditions to the embedding explainer. 

The authors evaluate TAGE on molecular graph, protein-protein interaction, and e-commerce product networks with multiple prediction tasks. Results show that the single embedding explainer in TAGE can efficiently provide high quality explanations for various downstream tasks. Compared to training multiple task-specific explainers, TAGE requires significantly less training and inference time while achieving better or comparable explanation performance. The proposed self-supervised training objective is key to enabling training without downstream tasks while still generalizing well. Overall, TAGE provides an effective and efficient approach for explaining GNN models, especially those involving multiple prediction tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a task-agnostic graph neural network explanation framework called TAGE. The key ideas are:

1. They decompose the prediction model into a GNN-based embedding model and downstream lightweight models. The explanation is also separated into an embedding explainer and downstream explainers. 

2. The embedding explainer is trained in a self-supervised manner to maximize mutual information between original graph embeddings and embeddings of the subgraph induced by the predicted important edges. The training uses a conditioned contrastive loss and does not require any downstream task knowledge.

3. The downstream explainers are simple gradient-based methods that provide importance scores for embedding dimensions to the embedding explainer as condition vectors. 

4. With one embedding explainer, multiple lightweight downstream explainers can be used to explain different tasks that share the GNN embedding model. This avoids repeatedly training task-specific explainers.

5. Experiments show TAGE achieves higher fidelity and sparsity compared to learning-based baselines. It also significantly improves efficiency in terms of training and inference time for explaining multiple tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a task-agnostic explanation framework that only requires training one universal embedding explainer to enable explaining unseen tasks as well as multi-task models efficiently. The self-supervised training objective avoids the need for any downstream task details.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the authors are addressing the following key problems/questions:

1. Current GNN explanation methods are task-specific, which makes them inefficient for explaining multitask models or models trained in a self-supervised manner. The authors aim to develop a task-agnostic explanation approach to address these limitations. 

2. How can we train an explainer model without access to downstream tasks or labels? The authors propose a self-supervised training framework based on conditioned contrastive learning to enable training the explainer without downstream task knowledge.

3. How to decompose a typical end-to-end explainer into components that allow explaining GNN embedding models independently of downstream models? The authors propose a two-stage explanation pipeline with separate embedding and downstream explainers.

4. Whether the proposed task-agnostic framework can achieve comparable or better explanation quality while improving efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art task-specific explainers? The authors conduct experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets to demonstrate the advantages of their method.

In summary, the key focus seems to be on developing a task-agnostic and self-supervised training framework for graph neural network explainers to address limitations of existing task-specific approaches. The core problems are how to train and architect the explainers to enable task-agnostic and efficient explanation of GNN models.
