# [CPM: A Large-scale Generative Chinese Pre-trained Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00413)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research focus is on pre-training a large-scale Chinese language model called CPM (Chinese Pre-trained Language Model) and evaluating its performance on various downstream Chinese NLP tasks. 

The main hypothesis seems to be that pre-training a very large autoregressive language model on a diverse corpus of Chinese text will result in a model that has strong few-shot and zero-shot abilities on a variety of Chinese NLP tasks like text classification, dialogue, question answering, etc.

Specifically, some of the key research questions/goals addressed in the paper include:

- How to construct an effective subword vocabulary and optimize training strategies like batch size to adapt a language model architecture like GPT to Chinese text.

- Evaluating the impact of model size - they pre-train small, medium and large versions of CPM and test how performance on downstream tasks correlates with number of parameters.

- Testing CPM's few-shot and zero-shot abilities on tasks like text classification, QA, dialogue, etc compared to prior Chinese PLMs.

- Analyzing the sample outputs qualitatively to get a sense of CPM's language generation capabilities.

So in summary, the central focus is on pushing the boundaries of Chinese PLMs by pre-training a very large model on diverse Chinese corpora and evaluating its generalized few-shot/zero-shot abilities. The key hypothesis is that scale (model size + data size) leads to strong language modeling and downstream task performance.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing and releasing CPM, a large-scale Chinese pre-trained language model. Specifically, the key aspects explored in the paper are:

- Constructing CPM, a new Chinese autoregressive language model with generative pre-training on large-scale Chinese corpora. The goal is to create a powerful generative model for Chinese similar to GPT-3.

- Pre-training CPM models of various sizes up to 2.6 billion parameters, which the authors state is the largest Chinese pre-trained language model to date.

- Developing methods to enable pre-training this large model, including constructing a new Chinese subword vocabulary and using a large batch size.

- Evaluating CPM models on a range of Chinese NLP tasks such as text classification, dialogue, QA, and text generation in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

- Analyzing the impact of model size on downstream task performance and finding larger CPM models achieve better performance, indicating the benefits of scale for language generation and understanding.

So in summary, the central research focus is on pre-training and releasing CPM as a large-scale Chinese language model, and evaluating its capabilities for few-shot learning across diverse language tasks. The key hypothesis seems to be that larger Chinese PLMs will lead to better performance in generative and discriminative language tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in natural language processing:

- The main contribution of this paper is introducing CPM, a large-scale Chinese pre-trained language model. There are other Chinese PLMs like BERT-wwm and ERNIE, but CPM is significantly larger at 2.6B parameters trained on 100GB of Chinese data. The scale of CPM seems unprecedented for a Chinese PLM.

- The model architecture of CPM follows GPT, using a Transformer decoder. This is different from BERT-style models which use an encoder-only architecture. The autoregressive nature of CPM makes it more suitable for natural language generation tasks.

- The authors perform extensive experiments demonstrating CPM's effectiveness on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks including text classification, dialogue, QA, cloze test etc. The strong performance in low-shot and zero-shot settings highlights CPM's ability to generalize.

- One limitation is that most tasks are formulated as text generation, which fits the autoregressive nature of CPM, but may not be ideal for tasks like QA where concise answers are preferred. The authors acknowledge this issue.

- Overall, CPM seems to push the boundaries on scale for Chinese PLMs and shows impressive generalization ability. The model size and training techniques like using word segmentation and larger batches are novel engineering contributions. The comprehensive evaluation benchmarks CPM on a diverse set of NLP tasks. This seems like an impactful paper in the field of Chinese PLMs.

In summary, the scale and broad evaluation of CPM distinguishes this paper from prior work on Chinese PLMs. The results demonstrate the benefits of large-scale pre-training for transfer learning, similar to strides made by models like GPT-3. This seems like a valuable contribution to the Chinese NLP community.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of Chinese pre-trained language models:

- The key contribution of this paper is releasing CPM, a very large Chinese pre-trained language model with 2.6 billion parameters trained on 100GB of Chinese data. This makes CPM one of the largest Chinese PLMs to date. Previous Chinese PLMs tend to be much smaller in scale (e.g. BERT-wwm-chinese has 0.18B parameters).

- The model architecture of CPM is similar to GPT/GPT-2, using a Transformer decoder. This is a common architecture choice for autoregressive PLMs. Many other Chinese PLMs like BERT and ERNIE use encoder-only architectures. 

- The authors create a new subword vocabulary instead of using the BERT wordpiece vocabulary. They argue this is better suited for Chinese since it preserves more semantic meanings of words. This is a valid consideration for adapting PLMs to Chinese.

- The training data comprises different sources including encyclopedia, webpages, novels etc. A strength is the inclusion of 100GB of data which is much larger than previous Chinese PLMs. The diversity of data should help the model learn a rich language representation.

- They evaluate CPM on a wide range of downstream tasks including text classification, dialogue, QA, text generation etc. The strong performance, especially in low-shot transfer, demonstrates the pre-training learns useful linguistic knowledge that transfers across tasks. This is comparable to evaluations done for models like GPT-3.

- One limitation is that most tasks are evaluated only with CPM models without comparison to other Chinese PLMs. Comparisons would better highlight advantages of the larger scale and vocabulary.

In summary, CPM pushes forward the state-of-the-art for Chinese PLMs in terms of scale and demonstrates strong transfer performance. Some direct comparisons to other models would further highlight its improvements. But the release of models and code is an important contribution for advancing Chinese NLP.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Train larger models with more training data and parameters to further explore the power of large-scale pre-trained language models for Chinese. They suggest optimizing the training framework for efficiency, and also reducing model size via compression techniques.

- Include more diverse training data, such as multi-lingual text corpora and structured knowledge graphs, to enhance model capabilities. They propose exploring new algorithms to train joint models over both texts and knowledge graphs. 

- Improve performance on downstream tasks through further fine-tuning and optimization, for example on question answering where their models did not yet achieve very high scores.

- Build demos and applications to showcase the capabilities of the models on practical language generation and knowledge retrieval tasks.

- Conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and usefulness of the model's generated text. 

- Explore model parallelization and distributed training techniques to enable training even larger models.

In summary, the main future directions are around scaling up in terms of model size, training data, and downstream applications, as well as improving training efficiency and integrating structured knowledge. The authors aim to push the boundaries of large Chinese pre-trained language models.
