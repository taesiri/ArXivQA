# [Video-Driven Animation of Neural Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- High-quality generative models for animating realistic 3D head avatars are often trained on data from a single person. This results in person-specific latent representations that limit multi-person facial animation from video input.  
- Existing methods for multi-person video-driven facial animation using 3D morphable face models lack detail and realism. They also cannot be easily integrated into immersive real-time experiences like VR.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents an approach to enable high-quality, multi-person video-driven animation of personalized 3D neural head avatars.
- A hybrid head model is used combining geometry, dynamic textures and neural rendering for photo-realism.
- Person-independent facial expression features are extracted from input video using an existing technique. 
- These feed into an LSTM-based animation network that translates features into personalized animation parameters for the head model. 
- Training augmentations with learned residual features help disambiguate mappings between source and target.

Main Contributions:
- Bridges the gap between realism of personalized avatars and multi-person animation convenience.
- Uses a recurrent architecture to better model ambiguity in mapping across expression spaces.
- Enhances fidelity and realism compared to previous video-driven approaches.
- Allows easy integration of high-quality heads into immersive real-time experiences.

In summary, the paper enables realistic neural head avatar animation from multi-person video by using a hybrid model and learned mapping approach. It enhances state-of-the-art with more details, fewer artifacts and natural motions.
