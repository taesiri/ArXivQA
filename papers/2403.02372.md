# [OTClean: Data Cleaning for Conditional Independence Violations using   Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02372)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the important problem of cleaning databases to enforce conditional independence (CI) constraints. CI plays a pivotal role in areas like causal reasoning, feature selection, algorithmic fairness, transfer learning, etc. However, real-world databases often violate expected CI constraints due to biases or data quality issues. The paper focuses on repairing databases to restore CI constraints while minimizing changes to preserve data utility. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called OTClean that leverages optimal transport (OT) theory to learn an optimal probabilistic data cleaner. Specifically, the paper formulates the CI data cleaning problem as computing an optimal transport plan between the empirical data distribution and a repaired target distribution that satisfies the CI constraint. A key benefit of using OT is the ability to incorporate user-defined cost functions to quantify the distortion induced by data repairs.

The paper presents two formulations of the OT data cleaning problem:
1) As a Quadratically Constrained Linear Program (QCLP) that can be solved using optimization methods
2) As a regularized optimization problem enabling the design of a scalable iterative algorithm called FastOTClean inspired by Sinkhorn's matrix scaling  

FastOTClean alternates between computing an optimal transport plan using Sinkhorn iterations and reconstructing an improved target distribution based on principles of non-negative matrix factorization.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework OTClean that leverages OT for cleaning data to satisfy CI constraints
- Formulation as a QCLP and a regularized optimization problem 
- Efficient iterative algorithm FastOTClean that is scalable to high dimensions
- Demonstrated superiority over database repair baselines in experiments on algorithmic fairness and data cleaning
- Showcased ability to effectively eliminate spurious correlations while preserving utility

The paper makes important connections between CI in databases and OT theory while proposing an effective solution to an important data cleaning problem. The use of OT allows balancing utility and repairs through cost functions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces OTClean, a framework that leverages optimal transport theory to repair datasets in order to enforce conditional independence constraints while preserving data utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing a new framework called OTClean that leverages optimal transport theory for data cleaning to enforce conditional independence (CI) constraints. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Formulating the problem of data cleaning under CI constraints as an optimal transport problem. This allows utilizing suitable cost functions to quantify the quality of repaired data while preserving data utility.

2) Proposing both an exact formulation using a Quadratically Constrained Linear Program (QCLP) and an approximate formulation using regularized optimal transport. The approximate method enables developing a scalable algorithm based on Sinkhorn iterations.

3) Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate OTClean's effectiveness in two key applications - algorithmic fairness and data cleaning. The results show superior performance over existing database repair techniques and improvements in fairness metrics and model accuracy.

4) Providing optimization techniques such as parallelization, warm starting Sinkhorn iterations, and handling unsaturated CI constraints that significantly improve the computational and memory efficiency.

In summary, the main novelty is in combining CI constraints with optimal transport theory for principled data cleaning, with strong experimental validation, optimizations for efficiency, and applications in algorithmic fairness and data cleaning.

The paper introduces a framework called OTClean that leverages optimal transport theory for data cleaning/repairing to enforce conditional independence (CI) constraints. It formulates the CI data cleaning problem as an optimization problem using Wasserstein distance/optimal transport divergences. The paper proposes both an exact method by formulating a Quadratically Constrained Linear Program (QCLP) and an approximate, more scalable method using Sinkhorn algorithm and entropic regularization. The approximate method is based on relaxed optimal transport. 

The techniques are applied to two applications - enforcing algorithmic/interventional fairness by repairing training data to satisfy CI constraints, and general data cleaning tasks to remove spurious correlations. Performance is evaluated using metrics like AUC, F1, ROD, and compared to baselines.

So in summary, the key focus is on using optimal transport for data cleaning and repair to enforce CI constraints, and concepts like Wasserstein distance, Sinkhorn algorithm, relaxed optimal transport etc. are central to the proposed methods. The applications are in algorithmic fairness and general data cleaning.
