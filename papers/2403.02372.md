# [OTClean: Data Cleaning for Conditional Independence Violations using   Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02372)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the important problem of cleaning databases to enforce conditional independence (CI) constraints. CI plays a pivotal role in areas like causal reasoning, feature selection, algorithmic fairness, transfer learning, etc. However, real-world databases often violate expected CI constraints due to biases or data quality issues. The paper focuses on repairing databases to restore CI constraints while minimizing changes to preserve data utility. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called OTClean that leverages optimal transport (OT) theory to learn an optimal probabilistic data cleaner. Specifically, the paper formulates the CI data cleaning problem as computing an optimal transport plan between the empirical data distribution and a repaired target distribution that satisfies the CI constraint. A key benefit of using OT is the ability to incorporate user-defined cost functions to quantify the distortion induced by data repairs.

The paper presents two formulations of the OT data cleaning problem:
1) As a Quadratically Constrained Linear Program (QCLP) that can be solved using optimization methods
2) As a regularized optimization problem enabling the design of a scalable iterative algorithm called FastOTClean inspired by Sinkhorn's matrix scaling  

FastOTClean alternates between computing an optimal transport plan using Sinkhorn iterations and reconstructing an improved target distribution based on principles of non-negative matrix factorization.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework OTClean that leverages OT for cleaning data to satisfy CI constraints
- Formulation as a QCLP and a regularized optimization problem 
- Efficient iterative algorithm FastOTClean that is scalable to high dimensions
- Demonstrated superiority over database repair baselines in experiments on algorithmic fairness and data cleaning
- Showcased ability to effectively eliminate spurious correlations while preserving utility

The paper makes important connections between CI in databases and OT theory while proposing an effective solution to an important data cleaning problem. The use of OT allows balancing utility and repairs through cost functions.
