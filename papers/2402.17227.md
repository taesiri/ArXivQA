# [Efficient Backpropagation with Variance-Controlled Adaptive Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Efficient Backpropagation with Variance-Controlled Adaptive Sampling":

Problem:
Training neural networks is computationally expensive as it requires processing every data point in the batch and every connection in the network through repeated forward and backpropagation. This results in high time and computational complexity that scales with batch size and model size. There is a need for methods to accelerate neural network training.

Solution:
The paper proposes a variance-controlled adaptive sampling (VCAS) method to accelerate backpropagation. The key ideas are:

1) Construct an unbiased approximated stochastic gradient (ASG) by partially conducting backpropagation using fine-grained importance sampling. This is done by:
- Adaptive sampling on the data dimension when computing activation gradients. Samples data points proportionally to their gradient norm.
- Further sampling on the token dimension when computing weight gradients for linear layers. Samples tokens according to the leverage score.

2) Control the additional variance incurred by the ASG to be a small fraction of the original stochastic gradient variance. This is achieved by an adaptation algorithm that learns the sample ratios jointly during training.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes VCAS method that computes ASG using fine-grained adaptive sampling and controls its variance. VCAS reduces computational cost of backpropagation while maintaining accuracy.

- Achieves up to 73.87% FLOPs reduction in backpropagation and 49.58% overall speedup. VCAS mirrors the original loss trajectory and validation accuracy on various vision and language tasks.

- Adaptively determines sample ratios based on gradient sparsity patterns across layers and time. Eliminates need to manually tune this hyperparameter.

- Establishes robustness of VCAS across tasks compared to prior arts through extensive experiments on model finetuning and pretraining.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing an efficient and robust sampling-based method to accelerate neural network training by approximating backpropagation in an adaptive way with theoretical guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a variance-controlled adaptive sampling method to accelerate neural network training by selectively computing activations and weight gradients while preserving convergence and accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a variance-controlled adaptive sampling (VCAS) method to accelerate backpropagation during neural network training. Specifically:

1) VCAS computes an unbiased stochastic gradient with fine-grained layerwise importance sampling in data dimension for activation gradient calculation and leverage score sampling in token dimension for weight gradient calculation. This allows it to achieve lower variance and higher computational savings compared to coarse-grained sampling methods.

2) VCAS adaptively controls the additional variance incurred by the sampling during training by learning the sample ratios jointly with the model parameters. This helps ensure training convergence and accuracy are preserved.

3) Extensive experiments on multiple tasks show VCAS can reduce FLOPs of backpropagation by up to 73.87% and overall training FLOPs by up to 49.58%, while mirroring the original training loss and accuracy. The adaptive nature of VCAS also allows these savings to be automatically tuned based on task difficulty.

In summary, the key innovation is a robust and adaptive sampling scheme for accelerated backpropagation that provably controls variance and preserves accuracy across diverse tasks. The fine-grained nested sampling and joint learning of sample ratios are critical to achieving these properties.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Variance-controlled adaptive sampling (VCAS): The proposed method for accelerating backpropagation training by adaptively sampling activations and weights.

- Backpropagation (BP): The standard method for training neural networks by propagating gradients backwards through the network. VCAS aims to accelerate BP.

- Importance sampling: A technique VCAS uses to focus computations on more "important" samples and tokens to reduce overall computation.

- Unbiased stochastic gradient: VCAS computes an approximate stochastic gradient that is unbiased, ensuring convergence is unaffected. 

- Variance control: A key aspect of VCAS is controlling the variance of the approximated stochastic gradient to match that of the original gradient, preserving accuracy.

- Fine-grained sampling: VCAS samples activations and weights in a fine-grained manner, removing more samples and tokens in deeper layers to maximize efficiency.

- Self-adaptation: VCAS automatically adapts the sample ratios during training to determine the optimal ratios for efficiency without impacting accuracy.

In summary, the key focus is on an efficient, robust sampling method for backpropagation that adaptively controls variance and computational effort to accelerate training without sacrificing accuracy or convergence.
