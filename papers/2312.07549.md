# [Make-A-Storyboard: A General Framework for Storyboard with Disentangled   and Merged Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current story visualization methods focus only on character consistency while neglecting scene consistency. This leads to a series of unrelated images that lack inter-image coherence. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes representing stories using "Storyboards" - a format that unfolds a story scene-by-scene with consistent characters and scenes in each scene.

- To generate storyboards, the paper proposes a framework called "Make-A-Storyboard" that disentangles character and scene generation through two separate fine-tuning processes. It then merges them using a balance-aware strategy to create harmonized images with both character and scene consistency.

Main Contributions:

1) Presents the idea of generating visual storytelling using Storyboards rather than just individual images, significantly improving narrative flow and coherence.

2) Proposes the Make-A-Storyboard framework that applies disentangled control over character and scene concepts and merges them to ensure consistency of both.

3) Shows both qualitatively and quantitatively that the approach leads to superior alignment with textual prompts and reference images compared to state-of-the-art image customization methods.

4) Demonstrates that Make-A-Storyboard can be seamlessly integrated into several mainstream image customization methods like DreamBooth and Custom Diffusion to enhance their consistency and story visualization ability.

In summary, the key innovation is representing stories as visual storyboards rather than independent images, alongside a flexible framework to generate them with consistency in both characters and scenes. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on consistency metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a new story visualization representation called Storyboard that unfolds a story scene by scene, and introduces a framework Make-A-Storyboard with disentangled control over characters and scenes and merging strategy to achieve coherent Storyboard generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper presents a new representation form for Story Visualization called Storyboard, which unfolds a story scene by scene. This significantly enhances the coherence and expressiveness of Story Visualization. 

2) The paper proposes a general framework called Make-A-Storyboard for generating Storyboards. This framework employs disentangled control over the visual consistency of contextual correlated characters and scenes, and merges them to form harmonized images.

3) The paper demonstrates through extensive experiments that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Image Customization methods. It achieves both character consistency and scene correlation for effective Story Visualization.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the Storyboard concept and an effective general framework for generating coherent Storyboards with consistent characters and correlated scenes across frames. The method is shown to enhance existing Image Customization techniques for improved Story Visualization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Storyboard - A visual representation of how a story will play out, scene by scene. The paper proposes using storyboards for story visualization.

- Story Visualization - Generating a series of images that align with and illustrate a story prompt. The goal is to reflect the coherence of the story through visual consistency of characters and scenes.  

- Disentangled Control - Separately controlling and learning the visual concepts of characters and scenes in order to preserve semantics. The paper uses this to avoid entanglement of features.

- Balance-Aware Merge - A strategy proposed in the paper to merge the features of characters and scenes at an intermediate step in the diffusion process. This balances visual consistency and semantic alignment.  

- Make-A-Storyboard - The general framework proposed in the paper to achieve storyboard generation. It employs disentangled control and balance-aware merge.

- Scene Consistency - Maintaining consistency in the visual representation of scenes that are contextually correlated in the story prompt. 

- Character Consistency - Maintaining consistency in the visual representation of characters that appear in multiple parts of the story.

- Image Customization - Fine-tuning an image generation model on a few images to adapt it to a new visual concept. The paper shows the framework can integrate with these methods.

4. Explain the Balance-Aware Merge strategy in detail. How does it balance visual consistency and semantic alignment? What is the role of the segmentation model here?

5. What is Alternative Control and why is it needed after merging the features? How does it maintain visual information of characters and scenes?

6. How does Contextual Prompt Processing using LLMs help in dividing the story into scenes and identifying characters? What modifications are made to prompts?

7. What quantitative metrics were used to evaluate the method? How did it perform compared to state-of-the-art image customization methods?

8. What was the approach taken to evaluate generalization capability? Which mainstream image customization methods was the framework integrated with and how did they benefit?  

9. How suitable is the proposed method for multi-character story visualization? What changes need to be made to the pipeline to accommodate it?

10. What are some limitations of the proposed framework? How can it be extended to incorporate size and positional control during image merge?
