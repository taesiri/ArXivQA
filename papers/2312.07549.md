# [Make-A-Storyboard: A General Framework for Storyboard with Disentangled   and Merged Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current story visualization methods focus only on character consistency while neglecting scene consistency. This leads to a series of unrelated images that lack inter-image coherence. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes representing stories using "Storyboards" - a format that unfolds a story scene-by-scene with consistent characters and scenes in each scene.

- To generate storyboards, the paper proposes a framework called "Make-A-Storyboard" that disentangles character and scene generation through two separate fine-tuning processes. It then merges them using a balance-aware strategy to create harmonized images with both character and scene consistency.

Main Contributions:

1) Presents the idea of generating visual storytelling using Storyboards rather than just individual images, significantly improving narrative flow and coherence.

2) Proposes the Make-A-Storyboard framework that applies disentangled control over character and scene concepts and merges them to ensure consistency of both.

3) Shows both qualitatively and quantitatively that the approach leads to superior alignment with textual prompts and reference images compared to state-of-the-art image customization methods.

4) Demonstrates that Make-A-Storyboard can be seamlessly integrated into several mainstream image customization methods like DreamBooth and Custom Diffusion to enhance their consistency and story visualization ability.

In summary, the key innovation is representing stories as visual storyboards rather than independent images, alongside a flexible framework to generate them with consistency in both characters and scenes. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on consistency metrics.
