# [Comparison of No-Reference Image Quality Models via MAP Estimation in   Diffusion Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06406)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models have made great progress in recent years. However, little work has been done to compare these models from a perceptual optimization perspective. While existing NR-IQA models can effectively quantify image quality on fixed test sets, they appear ineffective in unconstrained image enhancement when directly optimized. Thus, the authors pose the question - can we compare NR-IQA models based on their ability to guide perceptual image enhancement?

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to incorporate NR-IQA models into a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for image enhancement, by supplementing them with a differentiable and bijective diffusion model (EDICT). This allows the NR-IQA models to act as natural image priors and generate enhanced images via optimization in the diffusion latent space. Differences in enhancement results by various NR-IQA models then allow perceptual comparison.

Specifically:
1) Formulate image enhancement as MAP estimation with NR-IQA model as prior
2) Convert diffusion model into a differentiable bijection using EDICT
3) Optimize in the diffusion latent space rather than raw pixels 
4) Use the varying enhanced images from different NR-IQA models for subjective testing

Main Contributions:
1) Propose MAP estimation in diffusion latents to enable NR-IQA models to guide meaningful image enhancement
2) Demonstrate a way to compare NR-IQA models based on optimization performance via analysis-by-synthesis
3) Evaluate 8 state-of-the-art NR-IQA models; identify relative strengths and weaknesses - interesting observations
4) Show optimized images can further improve NR-IQA models via finetuning

The main novelty is in using the optimization results for model comparison rather than just correlation metrics on fixed sets. This provides complementary insights into NR-IQA models.
