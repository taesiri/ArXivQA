# [Learning How to Strategically Disclose Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Considers a strategic information disclosure game between a sender who has private information about a state, and a receiver who takes actions that affect the utilities of both players. 
- Traditional models assume the sender knows the receiver's utility, but this may not hold in practice.
- Prior work for unknown receiver utilities is limited to finite state/action spaces, but intractable for continuous spaces.

Proposed Solution:
- Models the problem as an online Bayesian persuasion game with a sequence of unknown receiver types.
- Assumes Gaussian prior on state and quadratic utilities for tractability.
- Shows how to reformulate the static game as an SDP using posterior covariance matrices.
- Proposes an online gradient descent algorithm for the full information feedback setting and achieves O(sqrt(T)) regret with entropy signaling costs.
- For bandit feedback, utilizes an explore-then-commit approach and obtains O(T^(3/4)) regret.  
- Also considers sender costs beyond quadratic by restricting to linear signaling policies and parametrizing using error covariance matrices. Achieves sublinear regret using a perturbed leader algorithm.

Main Contributions:
- Provides first formulation and efficient algorithms for online Bayesian persuasion with continuous state/action spaces and unknown receiver utilities. 
- Establishes sublinear regret bounds for both full and bandit feedback settings.
- Introduces novel parametrization technique to enable handling of non-quadratic sender utility functions.
- Results help address practical limitations of traditional information design models with complete information.

In summary, the paper develops the online Bayesian persuasion problem with continuous spaces and unknown receivers, provides computationally efficient algorithms, and proves sublinear regret guarantees. The results expand the applicability of information design theory.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper studies an online version of Bayesian persuasion with continuous states and actions where the sender repeatedly interacts with adversarially chosen receivers and learns to efficiently disclose information over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It formulates an online version of Bayesian persuasion, where the sender repeatedly interacts with a stream of receivers with unknown types. This is in contrast to traditional Bayesian persuasion which assumes the sender knows the receiver's utility.

2) For the case of quadratic utilities and Gaussian priors, it shows a sublinear regret of O(sqrt(T)) is achievable when the sender has full feedback. It also gives an algorithm that achieves this regret bound.

3) It considers a "costly" Bayesian persuasion setting where more informative signals incur higher costs. With an entropy-based signaling cost, it shows linear plus noise policies are optimal and O(log(T)) regret is achievable.

4) It provides a novel parametrization to handle Bayesian persuasion with general convex sender utility functions. Using this, it gives an algorithm that attains sublinear regret for online information design even with non-quadratic sender utility.

5) It establishes achievable regret bounds for both the full feedback and bandit feedback settings. It also provides supporting simulations.

In summary, the main contribution is formulating an online learning framework for Bayesian persuasion to remove the assumption that the sender knows the receiver's utility, and providing computationally efficient algorithms with sublinear regret guarantees in this online setting.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Bayesian persuasion - The problem of a sender strategically designing and disclosing information to influence the actions of a receiver to maximize its own utility.

- Information design - The broader area of designing mechanisms, policies, or information structures to influence outcomes in a system with self-interested agents. 

- Stackelberg game - A sequential game with a leader (sender) who can commit to a strategy first, followed by rational followers (receivers).  

- Signaling schemes - Strategies used by the sender to reveal information to the receiver. This includes signaling policies, disclosure mechanisms.

- Regret minimization - Online learning framework where the performance of an algorithm is measured by how close it is to the optimal strategy in hindsight. Sublinear regret implies efficient learning.

- Quadratic costs - Assumption on the utility functions of players to have a quadratic dependence on states and actions. Enables a tractable reformulation.  

- Convex optimization - Many variants of Bayesian persuasion reduce to efficiently solvable convex programs. Allows use of online convex optimization algorithms.

- Computational complexity - analyzing the per-round running time and regret scaling with problem parameters like state dimension.

So in summary, key terms revolve around Bayesian persuasion, online learning, convex optimization, signaling schemes, regret minimization, computational efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper assumes the receiver's utility is quadratic. How would the online learning framework change if we allowed for more general convex receiver utilities? Would we still be able to achieve sublinear regret bounds?

2. Could we further improve the regret bounds by using adaptive step sizes or second order methods instead of online gradient descent? What challenges might arise in analyzing such extensions?

3. How does the entropy regularization term specifically induce strong convexity? Could other regularization techniques like Tikhonov regularization also induce strong convexity and improve convergence rates? 

4. The paper assumes Gaussian priors on the state of the world. How sensitive are the results to this modeling choice? Could the techniques be extended to other distributions with bounded support?

5. In the bandit feedback setting, only the scalar sender utility is revealed in each round. Could partial state feedback help improve rates beyond O(T^{3/4})? What feedback assumptions are critical?

6. For general convex sender utility functions, linear signaling policies are used. What signaling policies would be optimal here? Is it possible to characterize optimal policies for broad classes of convex utilities?

7. The perturbation based online learning method achieves O(dsqrt(T)) regret for general convex utilities. Can we improve dependence on dimension d? Are there other algorithms with better theoretical guarantees?

8. How does the choice of perturbation distribution N impact regret bounds and algorithm performance for the general convex utility setting? Can we optimize this choice?

9. The paper focuses on learning to disclose information strategically. How would the framework need to be modified to model strategic information acquisition before disclosure?

10. A key limitation is knowing receiver's utility. If that is also unknown, how can sender learn to persuade without explicit feedback from receiver? Are there techniques from preference learning that could be applicable?
