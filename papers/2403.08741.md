# [Learning How to Strategically Disclose Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Considers a strategic information disclosure game between a sender who has private information about a state, and a receiver who takes actions that affect the utilities of both players. 
- Traditional models assume the sender knows the receiver's utility, but this may not hold in practice.
- Prior work for unknown receiver utilities is limited to finite state/action spaces, but intractable for continuous spaces.

Proposed Solution:
- Models the problem as an online Bayesian persuasion game with a sequence of unknown receiver types.
- Assumes Gaussian prior on state and quadratic utilities for tractability.
- Shows how to reformulate the static game as an SDP using posterior covariance matrices.
- Proposes an online gradient descent algorithm for the full information feedback setting and achieves O(sqrt(T)) regret with entropy signaling costs.
- For bandit feedback, utilizes an explore-then-commit approach and obtains O(T^(3/4)) regret.  
- Also considers sender costs beyond quadratic by restricting to linear signaling policies and parametrizing using error covariance matrices. Achieves sublinear regret using a perturbed leader algorithm.

Main Contributions:
- Provides first formulation and efficient algorithms for online Bayesian persuasion with continuous state/action spaces and unknown receiver utilities. 
- Establishes sublinear regret bounds for both full and bandit feedback settings.
- Introduces novel parametrization technique to enable handling of non-quadratic sender utility functions.
- Results help address practical limitations of traditional information design models with complete information.

In summary, the paper develops the online Bayesian persuasion problem with continuous spaces and unknown receivers, provides computationally efficient algorithms, and proves sublinear regret guarantees. The results expand the applicability of information design theory.
