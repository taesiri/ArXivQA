# [Online GNN Evaluation Under Test-time Graph Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09953)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of evaluating well-trained graph neural network (GNN) models on real-world test graphs that lack node labels and may have unknown distribution shifts from the training graphs. Specifically, it aims to estimate the test error/generalization performance of a GNN model on such unlabeled test graphs, without access to the original training graph used to develop the model. This is an important problem to enable reliable deployment of GNNs in practical applications.

Proposed Solution - Learning Behavior Discrepancy (LeBeD) Score:

The paper proposes a method to estimate a Learning Behavior Discrepancy (LeBeD) score between the training and test graphs from a GNN training perspective. The key ideas are:

1) Run inference on the test graph using the well-trained GNN to obtain node representations and pseudo-labels. 

2) Retrain a GNN with the same architecture from scratch on the test graph, using the pseudo-labels as supervision. This models the training behavior on the test graph distribution.

3) Use a parameter-free optimality criterion based on reconstructing the test graph structure to determine when to stop the retraining. This indicates optimality.

4) Compute the LeBeD score as the L2 distance between the optimal parameters of the retrained GNN vs. the original well-trained GNN.

The LeBeD score indicates how well the training graph GNN can adapt to the test graph distribution in terms of capturing semantics and structural representations, providing an estimate of the generalization error.

Main Contributions:

1) Identify and formulate the novel problem of online GNN evaluation under test-time distribution shifts.

2) Propose the learning behavior discrepancy (LeBeD) score to estimate test error by comparing GNN training on training vs. test graphs.

3) Develop a GNN retraining strategy with parameter-free optimality criterion based on graph structure reconstruction.

4) Extensive experiments show LeBeD has strong correlation to ground truth test errors over various models and test graph distributions.

In summary, the paper makes both problem identification and solution contributions for the important practical issue of evaluating GNN model deployment in real-world applications. The LeBeD score is shown to be an effective estimate of generalization performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an effective learning behavior discrepancy score, dubbed LeBed, to estimate the test-time generalization error of well-trained graph neural networks on real-world unlabeled graphs under distribution shifts, without needing access to the original training graph.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new research problem called "online GNN evaluation", which aims to evaluate the performance of well-trained graph neural network (GNN) models on real-world, unlabeled test graphs under potential test-time distribution shifts. 

To address this problem, the paper develops an effective learning behavior discrepancy score called "LeBeD", which estimates the test-time generalization error of a well-trained GNN model without needing access to the original training graph data. LeBeD works by re-training the GNN on the test graph with a novel parameter-free optimality criterion, and computes the discrepancy between this re-trained model and the original well-trained model to reflect the expected test error.

The paper shows through extensive experiments that LeBeD exhibits strong correlations with the ground-truth test errors of various well-trained GNN models over diverse real-world graph datasets with distribution shifts. This demonstrates its efficacy as a practical metric for online GNN model evaluation under shifted test distributions in deployment scenarios.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Online GNN evaluation - Evaluating well-trained graph neural network (GNN) models on real-world, unlabeled test graphs under distribution shifts without access to original training graphs.

- Test-time graph distribution shifts - Changes in graph distributions between training and test graphs, including node feature shifts, domain shifts, and temporal shifts. 

- Learning behavior discrepancy (\method) score - A proposed score to estimate test-time generalization error of a well-trained GNN by measuring discrepancies in learning behavior between training and test graphs.

- GNN re-training strategy - A strategy to re-train a GNN on the test graph with supervision from pseudo-labels to model training-test discrepancy.  

- Parameter-free optimality criterion - A proposed criterion using graph structure reconstruction discrepancy to determine optimality of the re-trained GNN without introducing new parameters.

- Node prediction discrepancy - Discrepancy in pseudo-labels predicted by the well-trained GNN versus the GNN re-trained on the test graph.

- Structure reconstruction discrepancy - Discrepancy in ability of node representations to reconstruct graph structure between the well-trained GNN and re-trained GNN.

So in summary, the key concepts relate to performing GNN evaluation at test-time on unlabeled, real-world graphs, measuring training-test learning discrepancy through re-training, and modeling graph structure reconstruction ability to determine an optimal re-trained model.
