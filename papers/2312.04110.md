# [Small Area Estimation of Case Growths for Timely COVID-19 Outbreak   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04110)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a machine learning algorithm called Transfer Learning Generalized Random Forest (TLGRF) to estimate county-level COVID-19 growth rates in a timely and accurate manner. TLGRF addresses the challenge of balancing the speed-accuracy tradeoff in growth rate estimation by adaptively determining the fitting window size based on relevant features. It also utilizes transfer learning to pool data across space and time to improve estimates, especially for counties with limited data. The paper demonstrates TLGRF's superior performance against established methods through extensive experiments. For example, TLGRF reduces median error metrics by over 27\% compared to the next best method. The paper also shows via a case study that TLGRF could have helped public health authorities like Colorado's CDPHE improve outbreak investigation decisions by over 200\%. Overall, TLGRF provides more reliable real-time estimates of local COVID-19 spread to assist public health decision making. An online interactive tool is developed and used by authorities in several states.
