# [Mirror: A Multiple-perspective Self-Reflection Method for Knowledge-rich   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with knowledge-rich reasoning problems without access to external resources, due to limitations in self-assessment and generating high-quality feedback for self-improvement. 
- LLMs fail to consistently improve their outputs when relying solely on their own judgments, indicating inability in self-assessment.
- Even when ground truth labels are provided, LLMs often fail to update their incorrect predictions when prompted to revise them, suggesting difficulty in adhering to instructions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose \texttt{Mirror}, a multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection stage.
- It features a Navigator module to generate multiple question-specific directions to prompt the Reasoner module to adjust its responses accordingly.  
- An intrinsically motivated planning algorithm (based on Monte-Carlo tree search) is used to search for an optimal reasoning trajectory, using a novel reward mechanism considering:
   - Diversity of directions generated by the Navigator
   - Agreement among responses from the Reasoner under different directed perturbations
- Consistency among multiple perspectives is used as stop criteria for self-assessment at each reasoning step.

Main Contributions:  
- A multiple-perspective reflection framework to avoid reasoning traps and facilitate self-improvement for knowledge-rich problems, without relying on ground truth labels or external resources.
- A diversity-based reward and consistency-based answer assessment strategy that serve as reliable internal supervision signals.
- Empirical demonstration of \texttt{Mirror}'s superiority over recent popular self-reflection methods on multiple reasoning datasets, with over 15% average improvement. 

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of a Navigator module and an intrinsic motivation mechanism to enable more effective self-reflection from diverse perspectives tailored to the specific reasoning problem.
