# [Mirror: A Multiple-perspective Self-Reflection Method for Knowledge-rich   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with knowledge-rich reasoning problems without access to external resources, due to limitations in self-assessment and generating high-quality feedback for self-improvement. 
- LLMs fail to consistently improve their outputs when relying solely on their own judgments, indicating inability in self-assessment.
- Even when ground truth labels are provided, LLMs often fail to update their incorrect predictions when prompted to revise them, suggesting difficulty in adhering to instructions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose \texttt{Mirror}, a multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection stage.
- It features a Navigator module to generate multiple question-specific directions to prompt the Reasoner module to adjust its responses accordingly.  
- An intrinsically motivated planning algorithm (based on Monte-Carlo tree search) is used to search for an optimal reasoning trajectory, using a novel reward mechanism considering:
   - Diversity of directions generated by the Navigator
   - Agreement among responses from the Reasoner under different directed perturbations
- Consistency among multiple perspectives is used as stop criteria for self-assessment at each reasoning step.

Main Contributions:  
- A multiple-perspective reflection framework to avoid reasoning traps and facilitate self-improvement for knowledge-rich problems, without relying on ground truth labels or external resources.
- A diversity-based reward and consistency-based answer assessment strategy that serve as reliable internal supervision signals.
- Empirical demonstration of \texttt{Mirror}'s superiority over recent popular self-reflection methods on multiple reasoning datasets, with over 15% average improvement. 

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of a Navigator module and an intrinsic motivation mechanism to enable more effective self-reflection from diverse perspectives tailored to the specific reasoning problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Mirror, a novel self-reflection framework for knowledge-rich reasoning that enables language models to iteratively improve their responses by reflecting from diverse, question-specific directions generated by a Navigator module and leveraging consistency among strategic perturbations as a reliability measure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework called "Mirror" for enhancing large language models' (LLMs) capability of self-reflection and iterative improvement on knowledge-rich reasoning tasks. Specifically:

1) Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple perspectives by having a Navigator module generate diverse, question-specific directions to guide a Reasoner module, avoiding getting stuck in one reasoning loop. 

2) Mirror relies on consistency among strategically induced perturbations in Reasoner's responses as a measure of reliability for answer assessment and stopping criteria, without needing access to ground truth labels. 

3) Experiments on reasoning datasets demonstrate Mirror's superiority over several contemporary self-reflection methods in driving iterative improvements, thanks to its strategies of encouraging diversity and leveraging multiple-perspective consistency.

So in summary, Mirror contributes a new unsupervised framework for steering LLMs through more effective self-reflection on complex reasoning problems, via its novel mechanisms for eliciting and assessing diverse responses tailored to the specific questions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on enhancing LLMs through self-reflection and iterative correction. 

- Knowledge-rich reasoning: A main challenge explored is improving LLMs' performance on knowledge-rich reasoning tasks without access to external resources.

- Self-reflection: The paper proposes methods for LLMs to assess and improve their own outputs through internal self-reflection.

- Self-assessment: Discusses limitations in LLMs' abilities to accurately evaluate the factual correctness of their outputs.

- Feedback generation: Explores generating high-quality feedback to guide LLMs to revise incorrect predictions, without relying on human intervention. 

- Multiple perspectives: The proposed Mirror method enables LLMs to reflect on problems from multiple perspectives to avoid getting stuck.

- Intrinsically motivated planning: Leverages techniques like Monte Carlo tree search to reward diversity and consistency for more effective self-reflection.

- Consistency: Uses consistency across multiple internal perspectives as a measure of confidence in assessments and solutions.

So in summary, key terms cover self-reflection, planning algorithms, consistency, knowledge reasoning, and improving LLMs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called "Mirror" for knowledge-rich reasoning. Can you explain in detail the key components of this framework and how they work together? 

2. One main contribution of Mirror is using a Navigator module to generate multiple question-specific directions to guide the Reasoner. Why is this important and how does it help avoid getting stuck in reasoning loops?

3. The paper mentions using both intra-consistency and inter-consistency for answer assessment. Can you elaborate on what these two types of consistency measure and why considering both is beneficial?

4. What is the motivation behind using a Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm in Mirror instead of other search methods? How does the tree get expanded and nodes get selected during search?

5. Explain the two key strategies used in Mirror to address the limitations of language models - generating question-oriented directions and diversity-based rewards. How do they improve reasoning performance?

6. The consistency reward in Mirror influences both direction generation and answer assessment. Can you analyze how optimizing for consistency helps in these two components?  

7. One difference between Mirror and prior work is using multiple-perspective consistency instead of majority voting for answer assessment. What problem does this strategy solve and why is it more effective?

8. How does Mirror balance exploitation and exploration during tree search? What techniques are used to ensure search diversity?

9. The paper demonstrates Mirror's effectiveness on MMLU and FEVER datasets. What are some other potential applications that this approach could be beneficial for?

10. What limitations does Mirror currently have? Can you suggest any augmentations to the framework to address those limitations?
