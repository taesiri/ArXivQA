# [Continual Semantic Segmentation with Automatic Memory Sample Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05015)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method for continual semantic segmentation, which aims to tackle the problem of catastrophic forgetting when incrementally training a model on new classes over time. 

The key research question is: How can we effectively select a small set of exemplar images to replay for previous classes, in order to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in continual semantic segmentation?

The central hypothesis is that carefully selecting the replay samples by considering multiple factors like sample diversity and class performance, and enhancing the samples via a reinforcement learning agent, will lead to better regularization against catastrophic forgetting compared to prior heuristic selection methods.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel automatic memory sample selection mechanism for continual semantic segmentation, which uses reinforcement learning to learn an optimal selection policy based on comprehensive state representations. The goal is to enable more effective exemplar replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel automatic memory sample selection mechanism for continual semantic segmentation (CSS). Specifically:

- It formulates the memory sample selection as a Markov Decision Process and solves it with reinforcement learning. An agent network is introduced to automatically learn the optimal selection policy in a reward-driven manner.

- It designs effective components tailored for CSS, including: 

1) A novel state representation that contains both sample diversity and class performance features to guide the selection. 

2) A multi-structure graph space to measure inter-sample similarity and construct an informative state.

3) A dual-stage action space where the agent not only selects samples but also enhances them using gradients to boost effectiveness.

- Extensive experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, outperforming previous replay strategies by a large margin.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel automatic sample selection paradigm for CSS that learns an optimal policy in an end-to-end reinforced manner. This facilitates more effective memory replay and alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CSS.
