# [Continual Semantic Segmentation with Automatic Memory Sample Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05015)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method for continual semantic segmentation, which aims to tackle the problem of catastrophic forgetting when incrementally training a model on new classes over time. 

The key research question is: How can we effectively select a small set of exemplar images to replay for previous classes, in order to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in continual semantic segmentation?

The central hypothesis is that carefully selecting the replay samples by considering multiple factors like sample diversity and class performance, and enhancing the samples via a reinforcement learning agent, will lead to better regularization against catastrophic forgetting compared to prior heuristic selection methods.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel automatic memory sample selection mechanism for continual semantic segmentation, which uses reinforcement learning to learn an optimal selection policy based on comprehensive state representations. The goal is to enable more effective exemplar replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
