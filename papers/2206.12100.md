# [zPROBE: Zero Peek Robustness Checks for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus seems to be developing a framework for privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust federated learning. Specifically, the key ideas/contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel privacy-preserving robustness check based on rank-based statistics (median of cluster means) to identify malicious updates in federated learning without compromising clients' data privacy.

- Enabling private and robust aggregation even with malicious clients by incorporating carefully designed zero-knowledge proofs. Their framework, called zPROBE, is the first to provide Byzantine-robust secure aggregation with complexity that scales sub-linearly in the number of clients. 

- Optimizing the overhead of the zero-knowledge proofs using probabilistic bounds, to reduce client computation/communication costs without sacrificing security.

- Evaluating zPROBE on computer vision benchmarks like MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Results show it can defend against common Byzantine attacks with higher accuracy compared to prior art, while maintaining efficiency.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that their proposed techniques for establishing robustness thresholds privately using medians of clustered means, and verifying updates via zero-knowledge proofs, can enable practical and secure federated learning even with Byzantine participants. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework zPROBE in achieving this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Developing a novel privacy-preserving robustness check for federated learning based on rank-based statistics. They propose using the median of cluster means to derive a threshold for acceptable model updates in a privacy-preserving way. 

- Enabling private and robust aggregation in the presence of malicious clients by incorporating zero-knowledge proofs. Their proposed Byzantine-robust secure aggregation protocol scales sub-linearly with the number of clients.

- Leveraging probabilistic optimizations to reduce the overhead of the zero-knowledge proofs without compromising security. This results in lower runtimes and improved scalability.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing a new framework called zPROBE that provides robustness against Byzantine attacks in federated learning while preserving the privacy of the client updates. The novel components include the median-based robustness check, integration of zero-knowledge proofs for security against malicious clients, and optimizations for efficiency and scalability.
