# [Replacing softmax with ReLU in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08586)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can replacing the softmax operation in attention with a pointwise activation function like ReLU achieve comparable performance to softmax attention in vision transformers?

The key hypothesis seems to be that dividing the pointwise activation by the sequence length is important for achieving good performance with alternatives to softmax attention. The experiments test this hypothesis by evaluating different activation functions combined with varying degrees of sequence length scaling.

The main result is that ReLU attention scaled by 1/sequence length can match the performance and scaling trends of standard softmax attention in vision transformers on ImageNet image classification. This suggests that the softmax operation may not be essential for good performance in attention, opening up possibilities for more parallelizable implementations.

Overall, the paper investigates alternatives to softmax attention, with a focus on understanding the importance of sequence length scaling when using pointwise activations like ReLU. The main finding is that proper scaling enables ReLU attention to achieve accuracies on par with softmax attention for vision transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that replacing the softmax in attention with ReLU divided by sequence length can match the scaling performance of traditional softmax attention for vision transformers. 

Specifically, the paper shows that using ReLU attention instead of softmax attention does not degrade accuracy as model size increases when training vision transformers on ImageNet-21k. This is in contrast to some prior work that observed degraded performance when replacing softmax with activations like ReLU. The key difference is dividing the ReLU attention weights by the sequence length.

The paper demonstrates this through experiments training small to large vision transformers with ReLU attention and comparing their scaling behavior and accuracy to equivalent models trained with standard softmax attention. 

The results show that ReLU attention can approach or match softmax attention in terms of scaling behavior as model size increases. This is significant because ReLU attention can be more parallelizable than softmax attention, presenting opportunities to improve transformer efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is empirical evidence that ReLU attention divided by sequence length can effectively replace softmax attention in vision transformers without degrading scaling performance. This enables more parallelizable attention without sacrificing accuracy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows that replacing the softmax in transformer attention with ReLU divided by sequence length can match the performance of softmax attention for vision transformers on ImageNet, enabling improved parallelization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to related work:

- The main contribution is showing that replacing softmax attention with ReLU/sequence length can match the performance of softmax attention for vision transformers. Prior work had found accuracy degradation with this substitution.

- It differs from work on linearly transforming queries and keys, like linear attention, because it still uses a nonlinearity before normalizing by sequence length. The paper finds removing the nonlinearity hurts accuracy.

- It is similar to other work replacing softmax with pointwise nonlinearities like ReLU or squared ReLU, but unique in stressing the importance of the 1/sequence length normalization, which is absent from related papers.

- It compares to attention with gating units, showing sequence length normalization is still beneficial in that setting. Overall, the results highlight sequence length normalization is an important component for good performance when removing softmax.

- The paper focuses on empirical results rather than providing a theoretical justification. The experiments systematically test different nonlinearities and normalization schemes.

- It is one of the first papers to show promising results replacing softmax in vision transformers at scale, rather than NLP models. The comparisons are enabled by training on ImageNet-21k.

In summary, this paper provides useful experimental results highlighting the importance of sequence length normalization when replacing softmax attention. It expands on prior work by demonstrating strong performance for vision transformers at scale. The results motivate future research into parallelizable alternatives to softmax attention.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring why the factor L^{-1} improves performance with ReLU attention and whether this term could be learned instead of fixed. The authors note this is an open question.

- Finding better activation functions than ReLU to use in scaled pointwise attention. The paper tested some options but there may be better ones. 

- Testing ReLU attention at larger model scales and dataset sizes to see if the benefits hold. The experiments were on smaller vision transformer models on ImageNet, but larger models may reveal new challenges.

- Exploring how ReLU attention performs on other modalities like text, or on other tasks like language modeling. The current experiments were only on computer vision tasks.

- Studying whether the gains of ReLU attention in parallelizability and speed translate in practice and how much they improve efficiency. The experiments measured accuracy but not runtime gains.

- Investigating modifications to other hyperparameters when using ReLU attention to see if further tuning can improve performance. The paper used default vision transformer settings.

- Analyzing the theoretical properties of ReLU attention compared to softmax attention. The paper gave a brief motivation but more analysis could be done.

In summary, the main future directions are studying why ReLU attention works, finding better activation functions, testing on larger scales, evaluating on new tasks and modalities, quantifying computational gains, hyperparameter tuning, and theoretical analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper explores replacing the softmax attention mechanism in vision transformers with a pointwise nonlinearity such as ReLU divided by the sequence length. Experiments on ImageNet show that this ReLU-based attention can match the accuracy and scaling behavior of softmax attention. The advantage of ReLU-based attention is that it enables parallelization over the sequence length, unlike softmax which requires a sequential operation. The authors find that dividing by the sequence length is important for achieving good performance with nonlinearity replacements to softmax. Overall, the work presents ReLU-based attention as a promising alternative to softmax attention in vision transformers, with computational benefits from increased parallelizability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores replacing the softmax operation in transformer attention with pointwise activations like ReLU. Prior work has found that simply replacing softmax with ReLU degrades performance. However, the authors find that dividing the ReLU activations by the sequence length L allows ReLU attention to perform comparably to softmax attention. 

The authors train vision transformers of varying sizes on ImageNet-21k and find that ReLU attention divided by L matches the scaling behavior and accuracy of softmax attention. They also experiment with different activation functions and show the importance of the L^{-1} normalization factor. Overall, the results indicate ReLU attention can approach traditional softmax attention, while also enabling improved parallelism since ReLU avoids an expensive softmax. This presents opportunities to accelerate transformer architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes replacing the softmax attention in vision transformers with a pointwise activation function like ReLU or squared ReLU, scaled by the inverse of the sequence length. Through experiments on ImageNet-21k, they find that this "ReLU attention" can match the performance of traditional softmax attention in vision transformers when using the 1/L scaling. Specifically, training small to large vision transformers with ReLU attention scaled by 1/L results in comparable accuracy and scaling behavior to softmax attention as a function of compute. The main benefit of this approach is it allows for easier parallelization over the sequence length, since ReLU avoids the exponentiation and normalization required in softmax. Overall, the paper shows softmax can potentially be replaced by a simpler, more parallelizable activation like ReLU in attention for vision transformers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is the computational cost and parallelization challenges of the softmax operation in the attention mechanism of transformers. Specifically, the exponent calculation and summation over the sequence length make softmax attention difficult to parallelize efficiently. 

The paper explores replacing softmax with a point-wise activation like ReLU to mitigate these issues. The main question it investigates is whether ReLU can match the performance of softmax attention in transformers, especially for vision tasks.

In summary, the key problems and questions are:

- The computational expense and parallelization challenges of the softmax in transformer attention.

- Whether ReLU attention can match the accuracy and scaling performance of softmax attention for vision transformers. 

- Exploring different point-wise activations and sequence length scaling factors to determine an optimal replacement for softmax.

- Evaluating ReLU attention across various model sizes on ImageNet to analyze its scaling behavior compared to softmax.

- Analyzing whether components like qk-layernorm and gating are needed for ReLU attention to work well.

The paper aims to demonstrate that ReLU attention can approach or match softmax attention for vision transformers, providing a more efficient alternative. The key questions center around replacing softmax while retaining accuracy and scaling behavior.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that dividing the ReLU activation by the sequence length L allows it to perform comparably to softmax attention. What is the intuition behind why this normalization is important for good performance? Does it relate to maintaining a similar expected value to softmax attention? 

2. The paper hypothesizes that the L^(-1) normalization ensures the expected value of the attention weights is O(L^(-1)) like with softmax attention. Does this similarity in expected value explain why it works well? Could you test this theory more rigorously?

3. The paper tests α values from 0 to 1 when normalizing by L^(-α). What happens for α > 1? Could normalizing by more than L^(-1) improve performance? 

4. For the different activations tested (ReLU, ReLU^2, GeLU, etc.), there wasn't a clear best choice when using L^(-1) normalization. But are there other activations not tested that could work even better? 

5. The method still seems to benefit from qk-layernorm. Does this indicate the normalization is not fully replicating the effect of softmax? Could you design an experiment to further probe this?

6. Adding a gated unit did not remove the need for L normalization. Why do you think the gating alone is not enough? Is there a different gating design that could remove the need for normalization?

7. The method enables parallelization over the sequence length. What are the practical speedups and scaling benefits of this in a production setting? How does it compare to other parallelization schemes?

8. How does this method's performance compare when using much longer sequence lengths than tested in the paper? Does the normalization still work as well?

9. For very large models, how does the performance compare to methods like linear attention? Could the ReLU approach complement linear attention?

10. The method is analyzed for vision transformers on image tasks. How well does it transfer to other modalities like text or general machine learning settings? Are there cases where it would not be as effective?
