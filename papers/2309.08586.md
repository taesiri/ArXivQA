# [Replacing softmax with ReLU in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08586)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can replacing the softmax operation in attention with a pointwise activation function like ReLU achieve comparable performance to softmax attention in vision transformers?The key hypothesis seems to be that dividing the pointwise activation by the sequence length is important for achieving good performance with alternatives to softmax attention. The experiments test this hypothesis by evaluating different activation functions combined with varying degrees of sequence length scaling.The main result is that ReLU attention scaled by 1/sequence length can match the performance and scaling trends of standard softmax attention in vision transformers on ImageNet image classification. This suggests that the softmax operation may not be essential for good performance in attention, opening up possibilities for more parallelizable implementations.Overall, the paper investigates alternatives to softmax attention, with a focus on understanding the importance of sequence length scaling when using pointwise activations like ReLU. The main finding is that proper scaling enables ReLU attention to achieve accuracies on par with softmax attention for vision transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is showing that replacing the softmax in attention with ReLU divided by sequence length can match the scaling performance of traditional softmax attention for vision transformers. Specifically, the paper shows that using ReLU attention instead of softmax attention does not degrade accuracy as model size increases when training vision transformers on ImageNet-21k. This is in contrast to some prior work that observed degraded performance when replacing softmax with activations like ReLU. The key difference is dividing the ReLU attention weights by the sequence length.The paper demonstrates this through experiments training small to large vision transformers with ReLU attention and comparing their scaling behavior and accuracy to equivalent models trained with standard softmax attention. The results show that ReLU attention can approach or match softmax attention in terms of scaling behavior as model size increases. This is significant because ReLU attention can be more parallelizable than softmax attention, presenting opportunities to improve transformer efficiency.In summary, the main contribution is empirical evidence that ReLU attention divided by sequence length can effectively replace softmax attention in vision transformers without degrading scaling performance. This enables more parallelizable attention without sacrificing accuracy.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to related work:- The main contribution is showing that replacing softmax attention with ReLU/sequence length can match the performance of softmax attention for vision transformers. Prior work had found accuracy degradation with this substitution.- It differs from work on linearly transforming queries and keys, like linear attention, because it still uses a nonlinearity before normalizing by sequence length. The paper finds removing the nonlinearity hurts accuracy.- It is similar to other work replacing softmax with pointwise nonlinearities like ReLU or squared ReLU, but unique in stressing the importance of the 1/sequence length normalization, which is absent from related papers.- It compares to attention with gating units, showing sequence length normalization is still beneficial in that setting. Overall, the results highlight sequence length normalization is an important component for good performance when removing softmax.- The paper focuses on empirical results rather than providing a theoretical justification. The experiments systematically test different nonlinearities and normalization schemes.- It is one of the first papers to show promising results replacing softmax in vision transformers at scale, rather than NLP models. The comparisons are enabled by training on ImageNet-21k.In summary, this paper provides useful experimental results highlighting the importance of sequence length normalization when replacing softmax attention. It expands on prior work by demonstrating strong performance for vision transformers at scale. The results motivate future research into parallelizable alternatives to softmax attention.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring why the factor L^{-1} improves performance with ReLU attention and whether this term could be learned instead of fixed.

The paper tested some options but there may be better ones. - Testing ReLU attention at larger model scales and dataset sizes to see if the benefits hold. The experiments were on smaller vision transformer models on ImageNet, but larger models may reveal new challenges.- Exploring how ReLU attention performs on other modalities like text, or on other tasks like language modeling. The current experiments were only on computer vision tasks.- Studying whether the gains of ReLU attention in parallelizability and speed translate in practice and how much they improve efficiency. The experiments measured accuracy but not runtime gains.- Investigating modifications to other hyperparameters when using ReLU attention to see if further tuning can improve performance. The paper used default vision transformer settings.- Analyzing the theoretical properties of ReLU attention compared to softmax attention. The paper gave a brief motivation but more analysis could be done.In summary, the main future directions are studying why ReLU attention works, finding better activation functions, testing on larger scales, evaluating on new tasks and modalities, quantifying computational gains, hyperparameter tuning, and theoretical analysis.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper explores replacing the softmax operation in transformer attention with pointwise activations like ReLU. Prior work has found that simply replacing softmax with ReLU degrades performance. However, the authors find that dividing the ReLU activations by the sequence length L allows ReLU attention to perform comparably to softmax attention. The authors train vision transformers of varying sizes on ImageNet-21k and find that ReLU attention divided by L matches the scaling behavior and accuracy of softmax attention. They also experiment with different activation functions and show the importance of the L^{-1} normalization factor. Overall, the results indicate ReLU attention can approach traditional softmax attention, while also enabling improved parallelism since ReLU avoids an expensive softmax. This presents opportunities to accelerate transformer architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes replacing the softmax attention in vision transformers with a pointwise activation function like ReLU or squared ReLU, scaled by the inverse of the sequence length. Through experiments on ImageNet-21k, they find that this "ReLU attention" can match the performance of traditional softmax attention in vision transformers when using the 1/L scaling. Specifically, training small to large vision transformers with ReLU attention scaled by 1/L results in comparable accuracy and scaling behavior to softmax attention as a function of compute. The main benefit of this approach is it allows for easier parallelization over the sequence length, since ReLU avoids the exponentiation and normalization required in softmax. Overall, the paper shows softmax can potentially be replaced by a simpler, more parallelizable activation like ReLU in attention for vision transformers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is the computational cost and parallelization challenges of the softmax operation in the attention mechanism of transformers.
