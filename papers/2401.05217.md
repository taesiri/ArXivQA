# [Exploring Vulnerabilities of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment   Models: A Query-Based Black-Box Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models aim to predict image quality scores consistent with human perception without access to pristine reference images. Ensuring the robustness of NR-IQA models is important for reliable performance evaluations of visual tasks.  
- However, there is a lack of studies on black-box attacks against NR-IQA models where the attacker has no knowledge of the model parameters/gradients. Existing black-box attack methods rely on substitute models and have limited attack performance. Attacking the regression-based NR-IQA also presents unique challenges compared to attacking classifiers, including:
(1) Lack of a clear definition of attack "success" due to the continuous output in regression. 
(2) Identifying effective attack directions is difficult without gradient information.  
(3) NR-IQA tasks are more sensitive to quality variations than classifiers, demanding stricter perceptual similarity constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the concept of "score boundary" to quantify attack success for an image based on the predicted quality score crossing a predefined threshold.
- Develop an adaptive iterative approach with multiple score boundaries to systematically intensify attacks.  
- Design initial attack directions leveraging image texture and sparse noise to target regions sensitive to NR-IQA models (edges, saliency) while constraining perturbations using Just Noticeable Difference (JND) for invisibility.
- Optimize attacks using a query-based black-box method adapted from prior work on attacking classifiers.


Main Contributions:
- First query-based black-box attack method against NR-IQA models.
- Concept of score boundary and adaptive iterative score boundaries to adjust attack intensity.
- Carefully designed initial attack directions targeting sensitive image regions while ensuring perturbation invisibility.  
- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art attack performance across multiple NR-IQA models, revealing their vulnerability to black-box attacks.
- The proposed method provides an effective framework for further research into NR-IQA robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a query-based black-box attack method for no-reference image quality assessment models by introducing the concept of score boundaries and leveraging an adaptive iterative approach with attack directions designed based on characteristics of the human visual system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes the first query-based black box attack method against no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models. This is a more practical and challenging attack scenario than white box attacks.

2) It introduces the concept of "score boundary" to quantify attack success for NR-IQA models. It also uses an adaptive iterative approach with multiple score boundaries to systematically intensify attacks. 

3) The attack directions are designed to leverage characteristics of the human visual system, using texture information and sparse noise focused on edge and saliency regions. This makes the attacks more effective while keeping perturbations imperceptible.

4) Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing black box attack methods on 4 NR-IQA models. It reveals vulnerabilities of these models to black box attacks, demonstrating the need to further explore and improve their robustness.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and effective black box attack method tailored to NR-IQA models, revealing their vulnerabilities to such attacks. The concepts and attack strategies introduced pave the way for further work on evaluating and improving robustness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) - The paper focuses on attacking these models which predict image quality without access to reference images.

- Black-box attack - The attack method proposed does not rely on model gradients or parameters and only uses query access to the NR-IQA model's outputs. 

- Score boundary - A concept introduced to quantify attack intensity and success on the continuous outputs of NR-IQA models.

- Adaptive iterative attack - The attack method uses multiple steps with adaptive score boundaries to systematically intensify attacks. 

- Attack direction design - Texture information and sparse noise are used to craft imperceptible but effective attack directions targeting areas sensitive to NR-IQA models.  

- Just Noticeable Difference (JND) - Used as a constraint to enhance invisibility of adversarial perturbations based on models of human perception.

- Correlation metrics - SROCC, PLCC, KROCC used to measure attack impact on consistency of quality scores with human judgments.

So in summary, key terms cover the attack formulation, adaptive iterative approach, attack direction design, invisibility constraints, and evaluation metrics focused on in this query-based black-box attack method for NR-IQA.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "score boundary" to quantify attack success on NR-IQA models. How is this concept defined and how does it help guide the attack strategy?

2. The attack method leverages an adaptive iterative approach with multiple score boundaries. How are the boundaries determined and adapted at each iteration? What is the rationale behind this adaptive strategy? 

3. The paper proposes designing the initial attack direction by leveraging texture information and sparse noise. Why are these properties useful for attacking NR-IQA models? How are the texture and noise signals extracted and integrated into the attack?

4. How is the attack region constrained to edges and salient areas of the image? Why are these regions targeted and how does focusing on them enhance attack efficacy? 

5. Explain the justification behind using the JND model as a constraint on the adversarial perturbation. How is the JND threshold incorporated into the attack optimization?

6. The method adapts the score boundaries during attack iterations using "increase" and "decrease" strategies. Explain these strategies and their role in optimizing attack intensity. 

7. Compare and contrast the proposed score boundary concept with the classification boundary used to determine success for attacks on classification models. What unique challenges arise for quantifying attack success on regression problems?

8. How do the contents and styles of the reference natural images used for extracting attack directions impact performance? Is effectiveness sensitive to this reference set?

9. The method claims improved efficacy over stochastic attack directions like Gaussian noise. Analyze the differences in mechanisms and explain why stochastic directions fall short.

10. The paperreveals vulnerabilities of NR-IQA methods to black-box attacks. Discuss implications of these findings and how the method provides a tool for further research into model robustness.
