# [Self-planning Code Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06689)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How can incorporating planning into code generation with large language models help improve performance on complex code generation tasks?

The key points are:

- Directly generating complex code from intent descriptions is challenging even for large language models. Humans tend to plan and decompose complex problems before implementing solutions.

- The paper proposes incorporating planning into code generation to help models understand complex intents better. 

- Specifically, they propose a self-planning approach where the language model first generates a high-level plan from the intent, and then generates code following the plan.

- This is achieved via few-shot prompting, without needing a specialized planning model or additional training data.

- Evaluations show sizable improvements in accuracy over direct generation, and enhanced code quality. The approach generalizes across languages.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating planning via self-planning prompts can significantly boost the performance of large language models on complex code generation problems, by decomposing the problem and providing structural guidance. The paper presents evidence to support this hypothesis through empirical evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a self-planning code generation approach using large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- It introduces planning into code generation to help LLMs better understand complex intents by decomposing the problem into simpler sub-problems. 

- It enables LLMs to perform self-planning through few-shot prompting, without needing extra training data. In the planning phase, the LLM generates a high-level plan from the intent and examples. In the implementation phase, it generates code guided by the plan.

- It shows empirically that this approach substantially improves the accuracy and quality of code generated by LLMs across various benchmarks and languages. Self-planning achieved up to 25.4% higher Pass@1 than direct generation.

- It provides analysis showing self-planning improves LLMs' ability to generate key tokens like control flow, operators, punctuation. It also enhances correctness, readability, and handling of edge cases.

- It demonstrates self-planning is an emergent ability in large LLMs, but planning helps most LLMs. The approach is also robust across prompt variations.

In summary, the key contribution is using self-planning with few-shot prompting to improve complex code generation capabilities of LLMs, without needing extra training. The planning phase breaks the problem down to make code generation easier and more effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models (LLMs) to handle complex intents. The key idea is to incorporate planning into code generation by having the LLM first generate a high-level plan to decompose the problem before generating the full code following the plan.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of code generation with large language models:

- This paper proposes a novel self-planning approach for code generation that has two key phases - a planning phase where the model generates a high-level plan, and an implementation phase where it generates code following the plan. This approach of incorporating planning is relatively new in code generation with large language models. 

- Most prior work has focused on techniques like reranking, retrieving, and modifying generated code as post-processing steps. In contrast, this paper presents a pre-processing approach that is complementary to post-processing.

- The idea of using prompting/few-shot learning to teach planning abilities to large language models without additional training data is creative. It reduces the annotation effort compared to collecting intent-plan pair training data.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates the self-planning approach against strong baselines like direct generation, chain of thought, and ground truth planning. The consistent and sizable improvements demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.

- The analysis of model confidence on key tokens provides insight into why self-planning helps - by boosting confidence on challenging control flow, operators, etc.

- Most prior work focused only on Python or monolingual settings. This paper tests the self-planning approach on multiple languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, Go showing broader applicability.

- The human evaluation of generated code quality is unique and provides a useful practical perspective beyond automated metrics.

- Overall, the self-planning approach seems to be a promising direction. The planning phase adds a missing structure that can handle more complex intents. This pre-processing view is relatively underexplored compared to post-processing techniques in the literature.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel planning-based technique for code generation using large language models and conducts extensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. The approach appears highly competitive against existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring hierarchical plans to handle more complex problem decomposition and logical structures. The current sequential list plan format has limitations in expressing multi-level nesting and branching logic. A hierarchical plan structure could allow for clearer modularization of subtasks.

- Incorporating techniques like automated prompt engineering and retrieval to optimize the few-shot prompts for self-planning. This could help maximize the performance improvements achieved through prompting.

- Going beyond code generation to explore how self-planning and abstract reasoning could be applied to requirements analysis and specification. The authors suggest extending the techniques to handle the more complex requirements involved in full software system development.

- Evaluating the generalization of self-planning across multiple programming languages in a more robust manner. The authors found the improvements vary across languages, indicating customization of plans for specific languages may help.

- Exploring synergies with other code generation techniques like reranking/post-processing approaches. The self-planning pre-processing approach is orthogonal and could potentially be combined with these other methods.

- Mitigating the threat to validity from prompt engineering through techniques like automated prompt generation. The sensitivity of LLMs to prompts remains an issue to be addressed.

- Expanding human evaluation to better reflect developer experience and include more qualitative feedback. The authors provide initial promising human evaluation but more is needed.

In summary, key directions revolve around enhancing the planning approach, integrating it with other methods, evaluating generalization and developer experience, and mitigating issues around prompt sensitivity. Overall the authors position self-planning as a promising technique worthy of further research and development.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach using large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

- Traditional code generation with LLMs struggles with complex intent. Humans employ planning to decompose complex problems before implementation. So the paper incorporates planning into code generation to help LLMs understand complex intent better.

- The approach has two phases: a planning phase where the LLM generates a high-level plan from the intent, and an implementation phase where it generates code following the plan. Prompting techniques are used so that additional training is not needed.

- Experiments on multiple benchmarks and languages show self-planning improves performance over direct generation. It enhances correctness, readability and robustness of generated code based on human evaluation. The plan improves prediction of key tokens like control and operators.

- Self-planning emerges at large enough model size, but benefits most models. Optimal design choices for it are explored. Overall, incorporating planning thinking makes code generation with LLMs more effective for complex tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to incorporate planning into code generation to help LLMs understand complex human intent and reduce problem difficulty. The approach has two phases - a planning phase where the LLM generates a high-level plan from the intent, and an implementation phase where the LLM generates code following the plan. 

In the planning phase, the LLM is given a few intent-plan example pairs as a prompt to learn to generate plans from intents. The plan outlines solution steps at a high level of abstraction. In the implementation phase, the plan is appended to the intent and fed to the LLM, which then generates code step-by-step based on the plan. Experiments on code generation benchmarks in multiple programming languages show the self-planning approach substantially improves performance over direct generation. Further analysis reveals the approach enhances model confidence in predicting key tokens like control flow, operators, etc. Overall, incorporating planning helps LLMs generate higher quality code that is more correct, readable and robust.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models (LLMs) that consists of two phases: a planning phase and an implementation phase. 

In the planning phase, the LLM generates a high-level plan to decompose the complex intent into easy-to-solve subproblems. It does this by utilizing few-shot prompting, where only a few examples of intent-plan pairs are provided to demonstrate the planning task. 

In the implementation phase, the LLM generates code step-by-step following the plan from the previous phase. By separating the complex intent into a strategic plan, the model can better understand the intent and generate higher quality code.

Experiments show this approach achieves significant improvements in metrics like Pass@1 compared to directly generating code from intent with LLMs. The self-planning approach also enhances correctness, readability, and robustness based on human evaluation. Overall, incorporating planning helps LLMs handle more complex code generation tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem this paper is addressing are:

- Code generation with large language models (LLMs) struggles to handle complex user intent expressed in natural language. Directly generating code from complex specifications is difficult even for powerful LLMs.

- Humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems before implementing solutions. This helps understand the problem better and make it more tractable. 

- The paper proposes incorporating planning into code generation to help LLMs address complex intent more effectively. Planning breaks the problem into easier sub-problems and provides higher-level guidance to generate code.

- The paper introduces a self-planning code generation approach with LLMs that has two phases: a planning phase where the LLM generates a high-level plan from the intent, and an implementation phase where it generates code following the plan.

- This approach aims to reduce the difficulty of code generation from complex intent by leveraging the planning capabilities of LLMs themselves through few-shot prompting, without needing additional training.

In summary, the key problem is handling complex user intent for code generation with LLMs. The paper proposes using the LLMs' own planning abilities to decompose intent and guide code generation in a two-phase self-planning approach. This aims to make complex code generation more tractable for LLMs.
