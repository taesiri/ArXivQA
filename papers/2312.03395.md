## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Diffused Task-Agnostic Milestone Planner (DTAMP) to address long-horizon, sparse-reward decision-making problems by planning a sequence of milestones using a diffusion model. DTAMP first trains an encoder, actor, and critic using goal-conditioned imitation learning on offline data to capture useful state representations and reaching behaviors. It then trains a diffusion model conditioned on start and goal states to predict a series of milestones represented as latent vectors. At test time, DTAMP generates milestones with the diffusion model then has the actor follow them toward the goal. Key benefits are: 1) the encoder learns control-relevant features to enable efficient planning from images/high-dim states 2) the diffusion model flexibly stitches trajectories from offline data to plan milestones for new tasks 3) using the actor as a feedback controller makes the method robust and allows planning milestones just once per episode. Experiments across D4RL goal environments and the challenging visual CALVIN benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with DTAMP substantially outperforming prior offline RL and sequence modeling approaches on long-horizon and multi-task problems. The method also shows strong robustness against environment stochasticity.
