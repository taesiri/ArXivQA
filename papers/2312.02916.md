## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MIND, a new rehearsal-free continual learning method based on parameter isolation and distillation techniques. MIND creates sub-networks tailored for each incremental learning task that share a fraction of parameters, facilitating knowledge transfer. It uses distillation to transfer condensed knowledge from a separately trained model for each new task into the respective sub-network. Two distillation procedures are proposed: using a separate model, and a self-distillation procedure allowing MIND to work under memory constraints. A gating mechanism is introduced to guide backpropagation and gradient flow. MIND is evaluated extensively on CIFAR100/10, TinyImageNet/10, Core50/10 and Synbols/10 in class incremental scenarios, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with accuracy improvements of 6-10% over current methods. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the different components. By effectively retaining knowledge within specialized sub-networks and distilling task-specific information, MIND advances the state-of-the-art in rehearsal-free continual learning.
