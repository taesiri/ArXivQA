# [Exact algorithms and heuristics for capacitated covering salesman   problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06995)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper introduces the Capacitated Covering Salesman Problem (CCSP), which combines concepts from the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Covering Salesman Problem (CSP). The goal in CCSP is to service customer demands through a fleet of capacitated vehicles based at a depot, while minimizing the total distance traveled. Customers can be serviced directly by visiting them, or remotely if they fall within the covering range of a visited customer. The CCSP generalizes the CVRP by allowing covering-based service, and also adds vehicle capacities to the CSP.

The paper also considers the Multi-Depot Covering Tour Vehicle Routing Problem (MDCTVRP), where demands must be covered through routes originating from multiple depots and without exceeding vehicle and depot capacities.

Proposed Solution:

For the CCSP, the paper proposes two Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations and also a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). The BRKGA encodes solutions as random key vectors that are decoded through a two-phase method involving demand assignment and route construction. Local search procedures are used to refine solutions. A matheuristic is also introduced to further intensify the search.

For the MDCTVRP, the paper puts forth a new Mixed ILP formulation that aims to enhance existing approaches. Lazy constraint separation procedures are employed.

Contributions:

- Formal introduction and modeling of the CCSP, combining concepts from CVRP and CSP

- ILP formulations and an effective BRKGA metaheuristic for the CCSP

- A matheuristic using a pool of routes for intensified search

- New mixed ILP formulation for the MDCTVRP that significantly outperforms prior exact methods, proving optimality for several previously unsolved instances

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in modeling, formulating and solving capacitated vehicle routing problems with coverage-based service. Both exact and metaheuristic methods are proposed that advance the state-of-the-art.
