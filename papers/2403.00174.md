# [A citizen science toolkit to collect human perceptions of urban   environments using open street view images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Commercial street view imagery (SVI) platforms like Google restrict usage for research purposes due to licensing terms. Open/volunteered SVI platforms exist but require substantial processing and quality control before usable.
- Capturing human perceptions of urban environments typically relies on resource-intensive methods like interviews and questionnaires. Developing an efficient and reusable way to gather these perceptions would help research aiming to improve quality of life in cities.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an open source pipeline to filter and process volunteered SVI (VSVI) from Mapillary using semantic segmentation and image quality analysis.
- Build a mobile-friendly web app to collect human perception ratings on 5 criteria related to urban environments, using the processed VSVI.
- Use a "citizen science" approach to gather ratings from volunteers via the easy-to-use web app.
- Apply FAIR principles to the data and software developed to enable reproducibility and reuse.

Main Contributions:
- Software to automatically download, process, filter and crop VSVI from Mapillary ready for perception analysis
- Smartphone-friendly web app with intuitive interface to collect human perception ratings on SVI 
- Case study collecting over 20,000 ratings across 100,000+ images of Amsterdam from 300+ people
- Open source and reusable pipeline applying FAIR principles that anyone can replicate for their region of interest

In summary, the authors developed an end-to-end open source toolkit leveraging Mapillary VSVI and citizen science to efficiently collect human perceptions of urban areas at scale, with the goal of enabling research that can guide planning decisions to improve quality of life.
