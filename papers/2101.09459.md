## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the field of conversational recommender systems (CRS). It reviews the key techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and open challenges in building effective CRS. Here are some ways this survey compares to other CRS research:- Scope: This survey covers the full pipeline of CRS research, from user preference elicitation, multi-turn conversational strategies, natural language processing, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, to evaluation. It provides a broad overview of the entire field. Other works tend to focus on a specific aspect like strategies or evaluation.- Technical depth: The paper dives into technical details across the different CRS components. It explains the mechanisms behind various preference elicitation methods, conversational strategies, NLU techniques, etc. Other surveys tend to provide high-level overviews without going deep into the models.- Latest advances: The survey covers the latest advances in CRS research, including key papers from top venues through 2020. The references are quite comprehensive and up-to-date. - Future outlook: The paper provides an insightful discussion of open challenges and future research directions for CRS. It highlights promising opportunities like joint optimization, debiasing, more advanced strategies, multimodal information, and better evaluation.- Structure: The content is well-structured around the key challenges. The sections build a logical progression through the CRS pipeline. Comparatively, other surveys may lack this clear organization.In summary, this paper stands out for its technical depth, coverage of the latest work, and focus on open problems and future directions. It provides both a solid overview of CRS for newcomers, as well as detailed explanations and opportunities for experienced researchers. The comprehensive coverage and pointers to future work make it a valuable reference for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several promising future research directions in conversational recommender systems:1. Jointly optimizing the three main tasks (recommendation, language understanding/generation, conversation strategies): Currently these are often studied separately, but they could benefit from sharing objectives, data, and being guided by an explicit conversation strategy.2. Studying bias and debiasing methods: Certain biases like popularity bias can be reduced via interactions in CRS, but other biases like exposure bias persist. More research is needed on bias in CRS.3. Developing more sophisticated multi-turn conversation strategies: Current strategies are relatively simple, more advanced RL and other techniques could enable better strategies.4. Enriching systems with additional knowledge: Early CRS used only items, later attributes were added, and now knowledge graphs are being incorporated. Additional multimodal knowledge like images could also help.5. Improving evaluation and user simulation: Evaluation remains challenging and expensive with real users. Better metrics, procedures, datasets, and user simulation techniques are needed.In summary, the authors highlight opportunities to better integrate the components of CRS, address bias, improve conversation strategies, incorporate additional knowledge, and develop improved evaluation methods as key future directions for research. Their discussions aim to inspire new ideas to advance conversational recommender systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper reviews the progress and challenges in conversational recommender systems. Conversational recommender systems leverage natural language interactions to elicit users' preferences and interests in order to provide personalized recommendations. The paper proposes a general framework for conversational recommender systems consisting of three components - a user interface, a conversation strategy module, and a recommender engine. It summarizes the key challenges in developing effective conversational recommender systems into five main directions: question-based user preference elicitation, multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies, dialogue understanding and generation, exploitation-exploration trade-offs, and evaluation and user simulation. For each direction, the paper reviews existing efforts and limitations. It also discusses promising future research directions such as jointly optimizing the three components, addressing bias, developing sophisticated conversation strategies, enriching systems with knowledge, and improving evaluation and user simulation. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and open challenges in building conversational recommender systems.
