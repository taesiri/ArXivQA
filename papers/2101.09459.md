It provides both a solid overview of CRS for newcomers, as well as detailed explanations and opportunities for experienced researchers. The comprehensive coverage and pointers to future work make it a valuable reference for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions in conversational recommender systems:

1. Jointly optimizing the three main tasks (recommendation, language understanding/generation, conversation strategies): Currently these are often studied separately, but they could benefit from sharing objectives, data, and being guided by an explicit conversation strategy.

2. Studying bias and debiasing methods: Certain biases like popularity bias can be reduced via interactions in CRS, but other biases like exposure bias persist. More research is needed on bias in CRS.

3. Developing more sophisticated multi-turn conversation strategies: Current strategies are relatively simple, more advanced RL and other techniques could enable better strategies.

4. Enriching systems with additional knowledge: Early CRS used only items, later attributes were added, and now knowledge graphs are being incorporated. Additional multimodal knowledge like images could also help.

5. Improving evaluation and user simulation: Evaluation remains challenging and expensive with real users. Better metrics, procedures, datasets, and user simulation techniques are needed.

In summary, the authors highlight opportunities to better integrate the components of CRS, address bias, improve conversation strategies, incorporate additional knowledge, and develop improved evaluation methods as key future directions for research. Their discussions aim to inspire new ideas to advance conversational recommender systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper reviews the progress and challenges in conversational recommender systems. Conversational recommender systems leverage natural language interactions to elicit users' preferences and interests in order to provide personalized recommendations. The paper proposes a general framework for conversational recommender systems consisting of three components - a user interface, a conversation strategy module, and a recommender engine. It summarizes the key challenges in developing effective conversational recommender systems into five main directions: question-based user preference elicitation, multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies, dialogue understanding and generation, exploitation-exploration trade-offs, and evaluation and user simulation. For each direction, the paper reviews existing efforts and limitations. It also discusses promising future research directions such as jointly optimizing the three components, addressing bias, developing sophisticated conversation strategies, enriching systems with knowledge, and improving evaluation and user simulation. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and open challenges in building conversational recommender systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for conversational recommender systems (CRSs) based on a multi-goal driven conversation generation (MGCG) framework. The key idea is to enable CRSs to naturally lead conversations across multiple goals and topics, not just recommendation. The MGCG framework has two main components - a goal planning module and a goal-guided responding module. The goal planning module controls the dialogue flow by estimating whether to change the goal for the current turn or not based on the dialogue history and previous goal. This allows proactively changing between goals like recommendation, question answering, and chitchat. The goal-guided responding module then generates an appropriate response for the selected goal using neural networks. 

To train and evaluate the MGCG framework, the authors create a new conversational recommendation dataset called DuRecDial which contains dialogues with diverse goals. Experiments on DuRecDial show the MGCG framework can successfully change goals during the conversation while maintaining dialogue consistency. The framework also outperforms baselines in automatic and human evaluations. Overall, the work demonstrates the promise of extending CRSs to handle multiple goals and topics during a conversation, leading to more natural and human-like interactions. A key advantage is enhancing user engagement by proactively guiding interesting dialogue directions, not just focusing on item recommendation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a conversational recommender system based on a multi-goal driven conversation generation (MGCG) framework. The key novelty is the ability to conduct multi-type conversations, i.e. both recommendation dialogs and non-recommendation dialogs like chitchat and question answering. The core of the framework is a goal planning module that can flexibly switch between dialog goals based on the conversation context. Specifically, it estimates the probability of changing the goal in the current turn compared to the previous turn, using the conversation history and previous goal as input. If the probability exceeds a threshold, the goal is changed, otherwise it remains the same. This allows seamless topic transitions and mixing of dialog types. The framework uses neural networks for response generation conditioned on the selected goal. A new dataset called DuRecDial is constructed to support this multi-type dialog setting. The MGCG model is shown to outperform baselines in automatic and human evaluations. Overall, the work enables richer, more natural conversations compared to systems limited to just item recommendation dialogs.
