# [From the Lab to the Theater: An Unconventional Field Robotics Journey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Artistic performances involving robots present unique challenges similar to other robot deployments outside controlled labs, such as communication protocols for coordination and localization methods in dynamic environments.

Solution: 
- The paper explores these technical challenges through the case study of an artistic project called DESSAIM involving three robotic swarms (tabletop, flying, and human-scale) performing artistic behaviors.

Key Contributions:

- Describes the collaborative process of designing swarm behaviors between artists and engineers, using tools like Buzz and ARGoS. An example "firework" behavior is shown.

- Introduces the three robotic swarms deployed: Sushis (small tabletop bots), CrazyCognies (custom flying bots), and Doodies (Clearpath bases with arms). Details hardware and software architecture of each.

- Discusses need for reliable, scalable communication protocols for coordination of behaviors. Uses Zenoh pub/sub for communication with low overhead.

- Explains requirement for global localization to ensure safety near audience. Deploys custom UWB setup for localization rather than vision systems. Compares UWB accuracy to motion capture ground truth. 

- Highlights learnings from iterative performances in front of live audiences and feedback sessions. Demonstrates importance of artistic performances as challenging field deployments of robotic systems.

In summary, the key technical contributions are the Zenoh-based communication architecture and UWB localization system to enable the safe, robust, and repeated artistic performance of swarm behaviors with three different robot platforms across multiple venues. The paper shows the value of creative artistic goals for driving innovations in field robotics.
