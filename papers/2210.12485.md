# DANLI: Deliberative Agent for Following Natural Language Instructions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic deliberative agent (DANLI) for following natural language instructions in 3D environments. The central hypothesis is that incorporating explicit symbolic reasoning and planning will allow the agent to better handle complex, long-horizon tasks compared to reactive approaches. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:1. Predicting subgoals in symbolic form will allow the agent to monitor and complete hierarchical tasks expressed in natural language instructions.2. Constructing an object-centric spatial-symbolic representation of the environment will support grounded reasoning and planning. 3. Applying online symbolic planning using the predicted subgoals and spatial-symbolic representation will lead to more reliable and efficient task completion compared to reactive approaches.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by evaluating DANLI against reactive baselines on the challenging TEACh benchmark. The results show DANLI significantly outperforms the baselines, supporting the claim that incorporating symbolic reasoning and planning mechanisms enables better performance on complex, hierarchical embodied tasks specified through natural language.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a neuro-symbolic deliberative agent, called DANLI, for following natural language instructions in 3D environments. The key ideas are:- It combines neural and symbolic representations for reasoning and planning. Symbolic representations of subgoals, objects, states, and actions enable interpretable planning, while neural models are used for perceiving the environment and extracting high-level goals from language. - It uses online symbolic planning with several innovations tailored for embodied AI, including searching for unobserved objects, pruning the search space, and recovering from action failures. This allows it to create efficient plans dynamically as it acts in the environment.- It achieves strong performance on the challenging TEACh benchmark, significantly outperforming prior reactive approaches. The transparent reasoning process also enables detailed analysis of the agent's capabilities.- It proposes a modular framework that integrates neural perception, language understanding, symbolic representation, and planning components. This demonstrates one effective way of building neuro-symbolic agents for instruction following.In summary, the paper makes contributions in proposing a novel deliberative agent architecture, achieving new state-of-the-art results on a complex benchmark, and providing insights into designing neuro-symbolic systems for embodied AI tasks involving language, perception, and planning. The results show the promise of deliberative neuro-symbolic methods compared to reactive approaches.
