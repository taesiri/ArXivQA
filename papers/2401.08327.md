# [Learn What You Need in Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learn What You Need in Personalized Federated Learning":

Problem: 
- Classical federated learning (FL) methods train a single global model on decentralized data located across different clients, which fails to provide customized solutions for each client due to data heterogeneity. 
- Existing personalized FL methods either fully collaborate all local model parameters or manually select partial parameters to participate, which cannot effectively capture the unique characteristics of each client's local data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Learn2pFed", a novel personalized FL framework based on algorithm unrolling, which can learn to determine the degree each local model parameter participates in the federated collaboration.
- Specifically, Learn2pFed introduces a diagonal matrix Lambda for each client to indicate the regularization strength of each parameter, making the participation degree a learnable variable. 
- By unrolling the iterative federated optimization into a deep network with Lambda as trainable parameters, Learn2pFed can adaptively learn the characteristics of local data and select the appropriate partial parameters to participate.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes personalized federated learning by learning the participation degree of local model parameters, enhancing adaptability to local data.
- Develops a novel algorithm unrolling based framework Learn2pFed to optimize the degree of participation as learnable parameters.
- Achieves superior performance over previous personalized FL methods on various tasks including regression, time-series forecasting and image classification.
- Reduces up to 93.45% communication cost with 20% performance gain compared to vanilla FedAvg in image classification.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative perspective of adaptive collaboration for personalized FL and provides an effective solution Learn2pFed based on algorithm unrolling. Extensive experiments verify its advantages over other baselines.
