## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) typically have high cost and long development times compared to aerial/ground robots due to the complexity of the underwater environment. Off-the-shelf AUVs may not be customizable or robust to environmental variability for specialized applications. Custom-built AUVs are costly and time-consuming to develop. There is a need for a modular, customizable, low-cost AUV testbed to accelerate testing of perception, planning and control algorithms.

Proposed Solution - Modularis AUV:
The authors propose Modularis - a modular AUV built on a BlueROV2 framework to address the limitations above. The key goals are low-cost, rapid bring-up/reconfiguration, and high modularity. 

Key Contributions:

Mechanical Design:
- Battery chassis to relocate battery below frame, making space for larger electronics enclosures
- Electronics enclosure tube holder to accommodate 3 sizes of tubes with same frame
- Stabilizer rings to mount electronics firmly inside tubes

Electrical Design: 
- Modularis Main Board - Base board to connect sensors, computers, thrusters in plug-and-play manner
- Sensor Board - Small hot swappable boards tailored to specific sensors that interface with main board  

Software Design:
- Dual OS system - ROS1-based tethered system for computationally expensive experiments leveraging land computer, and ROS2-based untethered system focused on autonomy with on-board computer
- Modular ROS nodes and messages for easy addition/swapping of new sensors and drivers

The paper discusses mechanical, electrical and software design details to enable low-cost rapid testing of perception, planning and control algorithms through the proposed modular AUV system. Future work includes further validation of the system and improvements to modularity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Modularis, a modular underwater robot built on a BlueROV2 framework to serve as a low-cost, customizable testbed for rapidly developing and validating perception, planning, and control algorithms for autonomous underwater vehicles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of Modularis, a cost-effective and customizable modular autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system built on a BlueROV2 framework. Specifically:

The key contributions include:

1) A mechanical design that upgrades the BlueROV2 to accommodate larger electronics hardware while maintaining modularity to support different configurations. This includes a new battery chassis, reconfigured frame layout, and 3D printed parts for mounting components.

2) An electrical design with modular subsystems for main control, power regulation, and sensors. This enables "plug-and-play" of different sensors and flexible reconfiguration. Key elements include the main PCB, power regulation circuits, and standard interfaces like CAN bus. 

3) A dual software system supporting both tethered high-computation experiments using ROS1 and untethered autonomous operation with more limited onboard computing using ROS2. This flexibility allows testing algorithms across differing computational requirements.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of Modularis as an open, flexible, and cost-effective AUV testbed system to accelerate testing and validation of perception, planning, and control algorithms for underwater robots. The modularity spans the mechanical, electrical, and software elements.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a modular mechanical design that builds upon the BlueROV2 framework. What were the key considerations and modifications made to the base BlueROV2 frame to enable modularity? How does the battery chassis specifically contribute to accommodating larger electronics enclosures?

2. What were the limitations with the default electronics enclosure configuration of the BlueROV2 that prompted designing a new enclosure? What factors were considered in upgrading it to a 6-inch and potentiall an 8-inch diameter enclosure? 

3. The paper discusses designing custom electrical sub-systems for modularis, including main, power and sensor subsystems. Can you elaborate on the key considerations and design choices for the power subsystem including the buck converter and battery management system?

4. What were the motivations behind choosing the specific electronic components such as the BNO085 IMU and CAN bus communication for the sensor subsystem? How do these choices enable modularity?

5. The software utilizes a dual boot system between ROS1 and ROS2. Can you explain the rationale and key differences between using the tethered ROS1 versus untethered ROS2 system? What types of experiments can be enabled with each configuration?

6. The paper mentions using Gazebo simulation during development. What capabilities does Gazebo add towards testing modularis's hardware and software systems? What are some examples of insights gained or limitations identified through the simulation?

7. The paper proposes a modular sensor array and nodes publishing sensor-specific messages. How does this architecture make adding or removing sensors more straightforward? Can you elaborate on the node-message configuration?

8. For applications needing object localization, what are some options discussed to determine an object's position relative to the AUV? What are the tradeoffs between a stereo camera system versus other potential solutions?

9. During field testing, what was discovered about managing buoyancy when changing the electronics enclosure size? How does the design help enable simple weight adjustments across configurations?

10. What types of more extensive validation is planned for future work around the electronics modularity and dual software systems? Can you describe what a potential experiment might look like testing person following capabilities across tethered and untethered modes?
