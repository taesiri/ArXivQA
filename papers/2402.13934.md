# [Do Efficient Transformers Really Save Computation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As transformer models are being scaled up to billions of parameters and trained on massive datasets, improving their efficiency has become crucial. Many efficient transformer architectures have been proposed, such as the Sparse Transformer and Linear Transformer. However, there is little theoretical understanding of whether these models can effectively replace standard transformers, and in what scenarios they offer computational gains. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a theoretical analysis of efficient transformers' reasoning capabilities by modeling reasoning as a dynamic programming (DP) process. They specifically focus on the Sparse Transformer and Linear Transformer.

Main Results:
- Prove that both efficient transformers are expressive enough to solve general DP problems, matching the standard transformer. However, contrary to expectations, the hidden dimension must scale as $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{L})$ with the output sequence length $L$ to guarantee correctness. This results in an overall complexity of $\tilde\Omega(L^2)$, equaling the standard transformer.

- For the task of evaluating arithmetic expressions, the complexity lower bound can be improved to $\tilde\Omega(L\sqrt{L})$ for both efficient architectures. The Sparse Transformer can solve this task with constant hidden size.  

- Identify a class of DP problems called "locality problems" where each step only depends on a small number $m$ of previous steps ($m=o(L)$). For such problems, efficient transformers can have reduced hidden dimension and overall complexity.

- Experiments on arithmetic, longest increasing subsequence, and edit distance confirm the dependence between problem scale, model dimension and performance. As problem size grows, efficient transformers need larger hidden sizes while standard transformers maintain performance at fixed size. 

In summary, the paper proves efficient transformers match the reasoning capability of standard transformers, but may lose their efficiency benefits for general reasoning. It also identifies problem classes where these models can unlock computational gains in practice. The theory is supported through extensive experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper theoretically and empirically analyzes efficient Transformers like the Sparse Transformer and Linear Transformer, finding that while they are expressive enough for general dynamic programming reasoning tasks, their touted efficiency gains over the standard Transformer diminish for such tasks, requiring model sizes that scale with problem size rather than remaining constant.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a theoretical analysis of the capabilities and limitations of efficient Transformers, specifically the Sparse Transformer and Linear Transformer, for solving reasoning tasks modeled as dynamic programming problems. The key findings are:

1) Efficient Transformers are expressive enough to solve general dynamic programming problems, but contrary to expectations, they require a model size (specifically the hidden dimension) that scales with the problem size rather than being constant. This makes their overall complexity comparable to standard Transformers. 

2) For the specific task of evaluating arithmetic expressions, efficient Transformers can be more efficient and achieve lower complexity than standard Transformers. 

3) Under a locality assumption where each reasoning step only depends on a small number of recent steps, efficient Transformers can also attain better efficiency compared to standard Transformers.

4) Extensive experiments on tasks like arithmetic evaluation, longest increasing subsequence, and edit distance validate the theoretical findings, showing efficient Transformers typically need larger model sizes as problem complexity increases while standard Transformers maintain constant size.

In summary, the paper advances our understanding of when efficient Transformers can and cannot achieve efficiency gains over standard Transformers for reasoning tasks, highlighting scenarios where they are suitable replacements as well as revealing limitations to their efficiency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows theoretically that efficient Transformers like Sparse Transformer and Linear Transformer require a model size that scales with problem size for general dynamic programming problems. But the experiments seem to indicate that the Linear Transformer has better empirical performance than this theoretical lower bound. Why is there a gap between theory and practice here?

2. For the arithmetic task, the paper shows the Sparse Transformer can solve it efficiently while the Linear Transformer has a higher complexity lower bound. What properties of the Sparse Transformer architecture allow it to work more efficiently for this localized task compared to the Linear Transformer?  

3. The locality assumption is key for identifying when efficient Transformers can be more efficient. Are there other similar assumptions, properties or task characteristics that would also enable the efficiency benefits of these models?

4. The paper links model size requirements to information bottlenecks in the architectures. Can we use information theory to more precisely characterize what makes a task amenable to efficient Transformers versus requiring the representational power of standard Transformers?  

5. Dynamic programming style reasoning seems particularly suited to analysis using this Chain-of-Thought formulation. What other types of reasoning would fit into this framework and could efficient Transformers solve them efficiently?

6. The analysis makes specific architectural assumptions about the Sparse and Linear Transformer variants. How sensitive are the results to changes in aspects like number of layers, attention patterns, etc?

7. What modifications could be made to the Linear Transformer to improve its efficiency for more general or less localized tasks? Are there other efficient Transformer architectures better suited for this?  

8. For real-world deployment, what are good criteria to determine when efficient Transformers can be substituted in place of a standard Transformer without significant performance loss?

9. The analysis models reasoning through dynamic programming style recurrent steps. Could efficient Transformers also be efficient for more parallelizable forms of reasoning?

10. What implications does this increased understanding of efficient Transformer capabilities have for designing tailored architectures optimized for particular applications?
