# [Mockingjay: Unsupervised Speech Representation Learning with Deep   Bidirectional Transformer Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn powerful speech representations in an unsupervised way that can benefit downstream speech tasks. 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new approach called Mockingjay to learn speech representations through unsupervised pre-training, without needing any labeled data. 

- Mockingjay uses bidirectional Transformer encoders to learn representations by predicting masked frames using context from both past and future frames. This allows considering both past and future context, unlike previous unidirectional models.

- The proposed "Masked Acoustic Modeling" pre-training task randomly masks some input frames and predicts the original frames based on past/future context.

- The learned Mockingjay representations significantly improve performance on downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis compared to other unsupervised speech representations.

- Mockingjay representations can be easily fine-tuned on downstream tasks to further improve performance dramatically compared to other methods that are limited to just representation extraction.

- Mockingjay requires less data and computational resources compared to methods like vq-wav2vec that force speech into a discrete token-like representation.

- Experiments show Mockingjay works much better than log Mel-features and other representations in low-resource settings with limited labeled data.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that bidirectional pre-training on speech with the proposed techniques can learn powerful and robust representations to benefit various downstream speech tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios. The results validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Mockingjay, a novel speech representation learning approach based on bidirectional transformer encoders. The key points are:

- Mockingjay is trained in an unsupervised manner using the proposed Masked Acoustic Modeling (MAM) pre-training task, where the model learns to reconstruct randomly masked speech frames using bidirectional context. 

- The bidirectional architecture allows Mockingjay to jointly condition on both past and future context, unlike previous unidirectional approaches. This enables learning more powerful representations.

- Mockingjay outperforms other representations like APC and raw Mel spectrograms on various downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis.

- Mockingjay can be easily fine-tuned on downstream tasks, achieving further improvements with just 2 epochs of fine-tuning. This shows the representations are robust.

- In low-resource settings with only 0.1% labeled data, Mockingjay still exceeds the performance of Mel-features trained on 100% labeled data. This demonstrates the value of pre-training.

- Overall, Mockingjay provides an effective and robust speech representation that transfers well across tasks and datasets. The bidirectional architecture is the key innovation enabling stronger representation learning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Mockingjay, a novel bidirectional speech representation learning approach, and showing its effectiveness on various tasks over other methods. The unsupervised pre-training is crucial for learning powerful representations that transfer well.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new speech representation learning method called Mockingjay that uses bidirectional Transformer encoders pretrained on unlabeled speech to predict current frames based on past and future context; it shows improved performance on downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis compared to previous unidirectional approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in speech representation learning:

- The key contribution is proposing a bidirectional speech representation model called Mockingjay. Previous prominent work like CPC, wav2vec, and APC use unidirectional models that only consider past context when encoding speech. Mockingjay uses a Transformer encoder that jointly conditions on past and future contexts, allowing it to learn more powerful representations.

- Mockingjay shows strong empirical results on downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art APC representations. Fine-tuning Mockingjay leads to further significant gains.

- Mockingjay is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using a proposed Masked Acoustic Modeling task, similar to BERT's masked language modeling in NLP. But unlike the recent vq-wav2vec which quantizes speech to apply BERT, Mockingjay directly works on continuous speech frames.

- For low-resource settings, Mockingjay with little labeled data still outperforms other features using full supervision. This demonstrates its transferability and ability to improve data efficiency for downstream tasks.

- Overall, Mockingjay pushes the state-of-the-art in speech representation learning through its bidirectional architecture and strong empirical results. The unsupervised pre-training framework is flexible and not restricted to just extracting features. Fine-tuning allows Mockingjay to be easily adapted to various downstream tasks.

In summary, this paper presents significant advances over prior work by overcoming the unidirectional constraint and learning more transferable representations to benefit downstream speech tasks. The proposed methods and empirical results move the field forward considerably.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating and deploying Mockingjay representations on more downstream speech and language processing (SLP) tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), voice conversion, and speech translation. The authors showed strong results on phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis tasks, but suggest the representations could be useful for other tasks as well.

- Experimenting with different model architectures and self-attention mechanisms beyond the Transformer encoder used in this work. The authors propose the bidirectional Transformer encoder as a novel approach for speech representation learning, but other architectures could also be explored.

- Exploring different pre-training objectives and self-supervised tasks beyond the proposed Masked Acoustic Modeling. The pre-training task is key for learning useful representations, so investigating other proxy tasks could lead to further improvements.

- Applying the methods to a wider range of languages beyond English. The authors use the LibriSpeech corpus which is English, but multilingual pre-training could make the representations more universally applicable.

- Testing the approaches in more low-resource settings with limited labeled data. The authors demonstrated strong low-resource results on phoneme classification, but further experiments in low-data regimes could better reveal the power of unsupervised pre-training.

- Investigating the transferability and portability of the learned representations to new domains. The authors showed positive transfer from LibriSpeech to the sentiment analysis dataset, but testing on more diverse datasets could be valuable.

In summary, the main future directions are centered around scaling up the approaches to more tasks, datasets, and languages, as well as exploring model architectures and pre-training objectives to further improve the learned representations. The unsupervised pre-training paradigm shows significant promise based on this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Mockingjay, a new speech representation learning approach that uses bidirectional Transformer encoders pre-trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled speech data. The key idea is to predict the current frame by jointly conditioning on both past and future contexts, unlike previous unidirectional approaches. During pre-training, the model is trained on a proposed Masked Acoustic Modeling task where it tries to reconstruct randomly masked input frames. Once pre-trained, the model representations are extracted and evaluated on downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis, outperforming other methods like APC and raw Mel spectrograms. Mockingjay also shows strong performance in low resource settings with limited labeled data. The representations are shown to be robust and transferrable across different datasets and tasks. An additional benefit is the ability to fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream tasks for further gains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Mockingjay for unsupervised speech representation learning. Mockingjay uses bidirectional Transformer encoders that are pre-trained on unlabeled speech data to predict masked acoustic frames based on past and future context. This allows the model to learn useful representations of speech by reconstructing the original signal. Mockingjay is trained on the proposed Masked Acoustic Modeling task, where 15% of frames are randomly masked and the model must predict the original frames. Representations learned by Mockingjay improve performance on downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis compared to previous unsupervised methods like Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC). Mockingjay also shows strong performance in low-resource settings, outperforming log Mel-features trained on 100% of labeled data when trained on just 0.1% of labels.

In summary, this paper makes two main contributions. First, it proposes Mockingjay, a novel bidirectional Transformer model for speech representation learning. Second, it shows Mockingjay representations improve performance on various downstream tasks, especially under low-resource conditions. The results demonstrate the benefits of pre-training deep bidirectional models on unlabeled speech before fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Mockingjay provides general speech representations that encapsulate various useful linguistic and acoustic information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Mockingjay, a speech representation learning approach that uses bidirectional Transformer encoders pretrained on unlabeled speech data. During pretraining, the model is trained on the proposed Masked Acoustic Modeling (MAM) task, where 15% of the input speech frames are randomly masked and the model must predict the original frames based on context. This allows the model to learn representations by jointly conditioning on past and future contexts, overcoming the limitation of previous unidirectional approaches. The pretrained Mockingjay representations improve performance on downstream tasks like phoneme classification, speaker recognition, and sentiment analysis when incorporated into task-specific models. Notably, the model can be easily fine-tuned on downstream tasks in just 2 epochs to further boost performance. A key advantage demonstrated is that Mockingjay requires much less labeled data to outperform models trained only on labeled data like Mel spectrograms.
