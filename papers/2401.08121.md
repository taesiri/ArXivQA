## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CycLight: learning traffic signal cooperation with a cycle-level strategy":

Problem:
- Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) aims to mitigate urban traffic congestion by dynamically adjusting signals based on real-time conditions. However, existing RL-based methods have limitations in computational efficiency, safety, and practicality due to their step-by-step control logic.  

- Cycle-level control strategy is more preferred for practicality but faces challenges in its intricate action space involving both cycle length (discrete) and phase splits (continuous). No existing method can optimize them simultaneously.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CycLight, a novel cycle-level RL approach using Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (PDQN) algorithm to perform discrete-continuous hybrid actions.  

- CycLight represents cycle length with discrete actions and phase splits with continuous parameters. It jointly evolves them to find the optimal cycle and avoid exhaustive split search.

- A decentralized framework with attention mechanism is designed for scalable multi-agent cooperation by correcting influence weights of surroundings on each intersection.

Main Contributions:
- First adoption of MARL with discrete-continuous action space for cycle-level network traffic signal control.

- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, with significant reductions in average waiting time and improvements in network throughput.

- Robustness against information transmission delays between intersections, shown by advanced control strategy.

- Well-designed PAMDP tailored for cycle-level control, along with decentralized cooperation framework suitable for large-scale networks.

In summary, CycLight advances the frontier of RL-based adaptive signal control through a novel cycle-level strategy and demonstrates strong potential for real-world practice.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CycLight, a novel cycle-level reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for network-level adaptive traffic signal control (NATSC). Specifically:

1) CycLight adopts a cycle-level strategy, optimizing cycle length and splits simultaneously using Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (PDQN). This effectively reduces computational burden while enhancing real-world applicability and safety compared to step-by-step controllers. 

2) A decentralized framework is formulated for multi-agent cooperation. Attention mechanism is integrated to accurately assess the impact of surrounding intersections on the current one. 

3) CycLight is tested in a large synthetic traffic grid simulation using SUMO. It demonstrates superiority over other state-of-the-art NATSC approaches in reducing average waiting times and improving throughput. Its robustness against information transmission delays is also showcased.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel, cycle-level, decentralized RL approach for NATSC that outperforms prior methods and is robust to real-world conditions like transmission delays. The combination of cycle-level strategy, multi-agent cooperation, and attention mechanism makes CycLight a state-of-the-art NATSC technique.
