# [A Generative Approach to Surrogate-based Black-box Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing surrogate-based black-box attacks against DNNs train discriminative surrogates to mimic the target network's outputs. However, with limited training samples, these surrogates fail to accurately learn the target's decision boundaries, resulting in low attack success rates. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel surrogate-based attack using a generative surrogate that learns the distribution of potential adversarial examples - samples residing extremely close to the target network's decision boundaries. This distribution contains adversarial examples nearly indistinguishable from original samples but classified differently.  

The proposed attack has two main steps:
1. Train a generative adversarial network (GAN) based surrogate that models the distribution of potential adversarial examples by optimizing losses related to: realism, inter-class similarity (pushing examples toward decision boundaries), and intra-class diversity (spreading examples across different decision boundaries).

2. Craft adversarial examples by drawing the closest sample from the surrogate's learned distribution that belongs to a different class than the original (untargeted attack) or belongs to a specified target class (targeted attack).


Main Contributions:
- Novel idea of using a generative surrogate to model potential adversarial examples near decision boundaries rather than training a discriminative surrogate to mimic target's outputs.  

- Optimization losses tailored to making the generative surrogate produce realistic looking examples residing close to the target network's decision boundaries.

- Extremely simple and fast attack strategy that queries the learned generative distribution only once.

Experiments show the proposed attack significantly outperforms prior arts in untargeted and targeted attack success rates using over 200x fewer attack iterations on average.
