# [Expert with Clustering: Hierarchical Online Preference Learning   Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the problem of learning and adapting to drivers' preferences for route recommendations in order to guide them towards personalized and sustainable mobility outcomes. Specifically, the authors consider an eco-driving recommendation system that needs to quickly learn driver preferences regarding tradeoffs between travel time and emissions in order to minimize regret and ensure user participation. The problem is challenging due to the complexity and unpredictability of human preferences. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel hierarchical contextual bandit algorithm called Expert with Clustering (EWC) that integrates clustering techniques and prediction with expert advice. The key ideas are:

- Assume driver preferences can be represented by a parameter vector theta_i that exhibits a clustering structure across the population. Use offline data to estimate theta_i for each driver. 

- Cluster the theta_i to identify centroids {c_k}. Treat each centroid as an "expert" that represents common preferences. 

- Use the Hedge algorithm to select the best expert E_i,t for each driver i at each round t. Make recommendations using the selected expert.  

- Update expert weights based on user feedback.

- Introduce a new Loss-guided Distance metric for clustering to ensure centroids properly capture common behaviors.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of the EWC framework that unifies clustering and prediction with expert advice for hierarchical preference learning.

- Introduction of the Loss-guided Distance metric to improve clustering performance.

- Regret analysis showing EWC can outperform baselines like LinUCB theoretically and empirically.

- Demonstration on synthetic mobility data that EWC reduces regret by 27.57% compared to LinUCB, approaching performance of Oracle methods.

The framework is particularly suitable for problems with latent hierarchical preference structures across a population of users. By exploiting commonalities, EWC enables more efficient and adaptive preference learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new hierarchical contextual bandit algorithm called Expert with Clustering (EWC) that integrates clustering techniques and prediction with expert advice to efficiently learn driver preferences for making personalized eco-driving recommendations, achieving substantially lower regret compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces a new hierarchical contextual bandit framework called Expert with Clustering (EWC), which integrates clustering techniques and prediction with expert advice to address the online preference learning problem. EWC effectively utilizes hierarchical user information to enable rapid and accurate learning of user preferences.

2. It proposes a new distance metric called Loss-guided Distance, which is instrumental in generating more representative cluster centroids. This enhances the performance of recommendation systems that use EWC. 

3. It establishes the regret bound for EWC, which consists of two parts - the regret from the Hedge algorithm and the bias introduced by representing users with centroids. This indicates EWC's superior theoretical performance compared to LinUCB, especially when there is a latent hierarchical structure among users.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of the novel EWC algorithm for online preference learning in contexts with hierarchical user structures. EWC outperforms existing methods by exploiting commonalities within user groups.

The paper introduces a novel hierarchical contextual bandit framework called "Expert with Clustering" (EWC) that integrates clustering techniques and prediction with expert advice to address the problem of online preference learning, with a specific application to eco-driving recommendations. Key aspects of the method include using clustering to discern hierarchical information among users, using cluster centroids as "experts" to approximate user preferences, and proposing a new "Loss-guided Distance" metric to generate more representative cluster centroids. Theoretical analysis is provided on the regret bound of the EWC algorithm. Experiments highlight that EWC can substantially reduce regret compared to a standard contextual bandit algorithm.
