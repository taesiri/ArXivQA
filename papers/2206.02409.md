# [Is More Data All You Need? A Causal Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02409)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is:Given an acceptably performing model, would incorporating more data or more targeted data help increase performance on specific samples of interest?In other words, if we have a neural network model with acceptable performance that misclassifies a sample or group of samples that are important for the application, what is the probability of classifying that sample or group correctly if we make interventions on the amount and type of training data?The paper aims to highlight the potential of using causal analysis as a tool to optimize resource allocation when developing machine learning models for medical imaging applications. The authors use causal analysis to estimate how much extra data is needed to achieve improved performance on targeted samples, rather than just increasing the overall dataset size.So in summary, the main research question involves using causal analysis to determine the impact of different dataset interventions on the classification performance for specific samples of interest in medical imaging models. This could help guide decisions about collecting and annotating datasets in a more efficient way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing and demonstrating the potential of using causal analysis to help optimize resource allocation when developing machine learning models for medical imaging applications. Specifically, the paper shows how causal analysis can provide insights into how changes to the dataset size and composition affect the performance of a model on classifying specific samples or groups of interest. This is framed as estimating the probability that a misclassified sample would be correctly classified if the model was retrained on a different dataset.The key ideas are:- Framing interventions on dataset size/composition as causal questions, allowing quantification of the effect on individual samples rather than just overall metrics. This is more fine-grained than active learning approaches.- Using causal analysis to optimize resource allocation when collecting data and training models, rather than blindly adding more data. The paper shows examples where adding more random data does not necessarily improve classification of specific samples.- Demonstrating the potential of this approach on a synthetic dataset and diabetic retinopathy image dataset. The analysis provides probabilities of correctly classifying samples under different data interventions.- Discussing how causal analysis could be integrated into model development and regulatory approval processes, to ensure models maintain accuracy when retrained on new data.Overall, the main contribution is highlighting causal analysis as a promising tool for providing important insights into data needs and resource allocation when developing medical imaging ML applications.
