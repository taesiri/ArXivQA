# [Is More Data All You Need? A Causal Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02409)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is:Given an acceptably performing model, would incorporating more data or more targeted data help increase performance on specific samples of interest?In other words, if we have a neural network model with acceptable performance that misclassifies a sample or group of samples that are important for the application, what is the probability of classifying that sample or group correctly if we make interventions on the amount and type of training data?The paper aims to highlight the potential of using causal analysis as a tool to optimize resource allocation when developing machine learning models for medical imaging applications. The authors use causal analysis to estimate how much extra data is needed to achieve improved performance on targeted samples, rather than just increasing the overall dataset size.So in summary, the main research question involves using causal analysis to determine the impact of different dataset interventions on the classification performance for specific samples of interest in medical imaging models. This could help guide decisions about collecting and annotating datasets in a more efficient way.
