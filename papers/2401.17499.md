# [AdvGPS: Adversarial GPS for Multi-Agent Perception Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multi-agent perception systems fuse visual information from sensors on multiple agents to improve perception range and overcome occlusion issues. This relies on accurate relative pose information between agents, determined by GPS signals. However, GPS signals can be imprecise due to factors like wireless transmission and obstructions. This paper investigates whether adversarial GPS signals can mislead multi-agent perception systems by reducing object detection accuracy.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes \textbf{AdvGPS}, a method to generate adversarial yet stealthy GPS signals that undermine multi-agent perception systems. AdvGPS formulates the attack as an optimization problem to maximize the discrepancy between original and attacked systems while constraining perturbations to be stealthy. Three types of discrepancies are introduced:

1) Appearance discrepancy between original and attacked projected point clouds 

2) Distribution discrepancy between original and attacked intermediate features

3) Task discrepancy in object detection performance with a classic detection model

By optimizing these discrepancies, AdvGPS generates adversarial GPS signals that are stealthy for individual agents but mislead the multi-agent system.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first investigation of adversarial GPS attacks against multi-agent perception systems

- Introduces AdvGPS method to generate stealthy yet adversarial GPS signals to undermine detection accuracy

- Defines three statistically sensitive discrepancies (appearance, distribution, task) to enhance attack effectiveness 

- Experiments on OPV2V dataset show AdvGPS substantially degrades state-of-the-art methods and transfers across different 3D detection systems

- Reveals vulnerability of multi-agent perception to GPS attacks, highlighting critical need to address security implications

In summary, the paper pioneers GPS attack investigation for multi-agent perception and proposes an effective attack method AdvGPS. Experiments showcase degraded performance across detection systems, underscoring this as an important open problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes AdvGPS, a method to generate adversarial GPS signals that are stealthy for individual agents but can significantly undermine the performance of multi-agent cooperative perception systems for 3D object detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AdvGPS, the first method to generate adversarial GPS signals that are stealthy for individual agents but can significantly undermine the performance of multi-agent cooperative perception systems. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces the concept of adversarial GPS attack into multi-agent cooperative perception systems, formulating it as an optimization problem with stealthiness constraints. 

2) Proposes three statistically sensitive natural discrepancies (appearance-based, distribution-based, and task-aware) to enhance AdvGPS attack success rates in black-box scenarios.

3) Conducts extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset, showing that AdvGPS attacks substantially degrade the performance of state-of-the-art point cloud based 3D detection methods for vehicle cooperative perception, with outstanding transferability.

4) Reveals the vulnerability of multi-agent perception systems to adversarial GPS signals, underscoring the need to address security implications as an important open research area.

In summary, the key innovation is the AdvGPS attack method and the discovery of multi-agent perception systems' susceptibility to it, highlighting a critical direction for improving robustness and security.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- AdvGPS - The proposed method for generating adversarial GPS signals to attack multi-agent perception systems. 

- Multi-agent perception system - The type of system targeted by the attacks, which uses multiple agents with sensors to collectively perceive the environment.  

- V2V perception - Used as an example multi-agent perception system. Stands for vehicle-to-vehicle perception between connected and automated vehicles.

- Adversarial attack - The attacks are framed as adversarial attacks meant to degrade the performance of perception systems.

- Black-box attack - The attacks are designed to be effective even in a black-box setting without knowledge of the target model. 

- Appearance-based discrepancy - One of the three statistically sensitive natural discrepancies introduced to improve attack success rates.

- Distribution-based discrepancy 

- Task-aware discrepancy

- GPS spoofing - Prior work on misleading GPS signals that is related.

- Object detection - The specific perception task considered, where adversarial GPS signals aim to increase false positives and negatives.

So in summary, key terms revolve around adversarial attacks on multi-agent perception systems using adversarial GPS signals, with a focus on V2V perception and 3D object detection. The attacks are designed for the black-box setting.
