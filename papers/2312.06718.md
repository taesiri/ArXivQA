## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep learning has made significant progress in intelligent manufacturing applications such as prognostics and health management, quality control, human action recognition, and robotics. However, deep learning models still face challenges like poor generalization, difficulty in acquiring high-quality training data, and unsatisfactory performance in complex scenarios. 

Recently proposed large scale foundation models (LSFMs) have shown powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks. However, the application of LSFMs in intelligent manufacturing is still at an early stage. A systematic overview of utilizing LSFMs to address deep learning's challenges in manufacturing is lacking.

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on applying LSFMs for intelligent manufacturing. It first summarizes the advances and remaining challenges of deep learning in manufacturing. Then it introduces background knowledge on LSFMs and analyzes their advantages in generalization, automatic dataset creation, and superior performance compared to deep learning. 

Next, the paper systematically discusses technical roadmaps to construct suitable LSFM systems for manufacturing in terms of:
- Enhancing generalization via pre-training, regularization, lifelong learning etc. 
- Automatic high-quality data generation using self-supervision and generative models
- Improving accuracy by prompt engineering, multimodal learning, distributed training etc.

Main Contributions:
- Summarizes deep learning's challenges in intelligent manufacturing and advantages of LSFMs
- Provides a systematic set of technical guidelines on how to leverage LSFMs to address these challenges 
- Presents real-world case studies of applying LSFMs in manufacturing lines and demonstrates their benefits

The paper delivers valuable insights on the great potential of LSFMs advancing intelligent manufacturing. It offers researchers and practitioners important references on adopting LSFMs in manufacturing scenarios.
