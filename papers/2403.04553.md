# [Improvements &amp; Evaluations on the MLCommons CloudMask Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cloud masking is an important preprocessing step for accurately estimating sea surface temperature (SST) and land surface temperature (LST) from satellite images. However, existing approaches like thresholding and Bayesian methods have limitations in performance and flexibility.

- MLCommons has identified cloud masking of satellite images as an area that can benefit from advances in AI/ML and has set up a benchmark task and dataset based on Sentinel-3 images. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper evaluates the performance of a U-Net model on the MLCommons cloud masking benchmark using the provided dataset of Sentinel-3 images.

- Experiments were run on NYU's HPC Greene cluster across multiple trials. Code modifications were made to the reference implementation to enable easier parallel runs, check pointing and early stopping.

Main Contributions:
- Achieved test accuracy of 0.896 using U-Net over 5 runs, improving over reference accuracy of 0.92. Report training and inference times.

- Contributed code fixes and enhancements like early stopping, parallel runs etc. back to MLCommons benchmark repository.

- Present first U-Net results on Sentinel-3 images for cloud masking task. Benchmarking serves as baseline for future research.

- Demonstrate feasibility of using NYU HPC cluster for MLCommons benchmark evaluation.

In summary, the paper advances state-of-the-art on MLCommons cloud masking benchmark by evaluating a U-Net model on the task, contributes code and performance improvements, and sets up infrastructure for future benchmarking work.
