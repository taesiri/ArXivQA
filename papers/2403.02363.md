# [Addressing Long-Tail Noisy Label Learning Problems: a Two-Stage Solution   with Label Refurbishment Considering Label Rarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper tackles the practical challenge of robust image classification when the training data simultaneously exhibits two imperfections - noisy labels and long-tailed distributions. Noisy labels refer to incorrect annotations in the training data. Long-tailed distributions characterize class imbalance where there is a significant difference in the number of samples available for different classes. Most prior works handle these issues independently, but their effectiveness diminishes when both noisy labels and imbalanced data distributions co-exist, which is common in real-world scenarios.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a two-stage training strategy - robust soft label refurbishment combined with multi-expert ensemble learning, to address the dual challenge. 

In Stage 1, unsupervised contrastive learning is first utilized to obtain robust representations for all training samples. This representation learning process is unaffected by label noise or distribution imbalance. Next, a novel Balanced Noise-tolerant Cross Entropy (BANC) loss is designed to train a classifier for initial screening of the data labels. Leveraging the prediction confidence and considering class rarity, a soft label refurbishment process is applied to refine possibly erroneous labels.

In Stage 2, an ensemble of three expert classifiers is trained based on the refurbished labels, with each expert specializing in different categories of classes - many-shot, medium-shot and few-shot. Customized loss functions are tailored for each expert to enhance long-tail recognition. The refurbished soft labels offer better approximation of the true distribution for weighting the losses.


Main Contributions:

1) A two-stage framework of robust soft label refurbishment and multi-expert ensemble learning to address simultaneous noisy labels and long-tailed distributions.

2) A label refurbishment technique that rectifies potentially erroneous labels by combining original labels with prediction confidence and class rarity information. 

3) Customized shot-adaptive losses for specialized expert classifiers to improve long-tail recognition.

4) Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with simulated and real-world noisy long-tailed data distributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage approach with soft label refurbishment and multi-expert ensemble learning to address the challenges of noisy labels and long-tailed distributions in image classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage approach to address the challenges of classifying data with both noisy labels and long-tailed distributions. Specifically:

1) In stage 1, the paper introduces a robust soft label refurbishment strategy. This involves first obtaining unbiased features via contrastive learning, then making initial predictions using a classifier trained with a balanced noise-tolerant loss (BANC). 

2) In stage 2, the proposed label refurbishment method is applied to obtain soft labels, which are then used to train an ensemble of expert models specialized for many-shot, medium-shot and few-shot categories. This provides a principled solution to handle the long-tail noisy label problem.

In summary, the key innovation is in combining soft label refurbishment to handle noisy labels, with a multi-expert ensemble method to tackle the long-tail challenge. Experiments validate that this two-stage approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple noisy long-tail benchmarks.

 Based on my analysis of the paper content, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper:

1) Long-tail noisy label learning: The paper focuses on addressing challenges in learning from datasets that exhibit both long-tail distribution and noisy (incorrect) labels simultaneously.

2) Label refurbishment: A key technique proposed in the paper to handle noisy labels by generating robust soft labels for training samples through weighing prediction confidence and label rarity.  

3) Multi-expert ensemble learning: The paper employs an ensemble of multiple expert classifiers, each specializing in different categories of data (many-shot, medium-shot, few-shot), to tackle the long-tail issue.

4) Shot-adaptive losses: Specially designed loss functions tailored for training the individual expert classifiers to enhance performance on subsets of many-shot, medium-shot and few-shot data categories. 

5) Contrastive learning: Utilized to obtain unbiased and robust data representations as the basis for subsequent training.

6) BAlanced Noise-tolerant Cross entropy (BANC): A new loss function introduced in the paper to enable balanced and noise-resilient classifier training.

In summary, the key terms cover label refurbishment, multi-expert ensemble learning, contrastive representation learning, and custom loss designs for handling long-tail noisy label classification challenges.
