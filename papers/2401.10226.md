# [Towards Language-Driven Video Inpainting via Multimodal Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional video inpainting methods depend on manually labeled binary masks to specify the regions for inpainting/restoration. Manually labeling masks is tedious and labor-intensive, especially for long videos.  
- No existing datasets have triplets of original videos, language descriptions of regions to remove, and ground truth inpainted videos.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new task of language-driven video inpainting which uses natural language expressions to specify regions for inpainting rather than masks.
    - Two subtasks: Referring video inpainting takes simple referring expressions as input. Interactive video inpainting takes conversational inputs.
- Construct a new dataset called ROVI with triplets of original videos, removal expressions, and inpainted ground truths.
    - Leverage existing referring video object segmentation datasets which have object masks and descriptions. Generate inpainting ground truths using a SOTA video inpainting model.
    - For interactive task, use LLMs and MLLMs to create conversation-like dialogs.
- Propose LGVI, an end-to-end baseline model for language-driven video inpainting based on diffusion models. 
    - Temporally inflate image-based model to process video inputs.
    - Introduce parameter-efficient Temporal Attention module for consistency.
    - Jointly train on referring image inpainting data as well for more diversity.
- Extend to LGVI-I which incorporates an MLLM for interactive video inpainting.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate a new language-driven video inpainting task to overcome limitations of mask-based video inpainting.
- Construct the ROVI dataset with comprehensive annotations to facilitate research.
- Develop diffusion-based LGVI and LGVI-I models as the first end-to-end baselines for referring and interactive video inpainting tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new task of language-driven video inpainting, where natural language instructions guide the inpainting process to remove or restore objects in videos, and proposes a dataset, model architecture, and baseline for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a novel language-driven video inpainting task, which significantly reduces reliance on human-labeled masks in video inpainting applications. This task includes two distinct sub-tasks: referring video inpainting and interactive video inpainting.

2. Proposing a dataset called Remove Objects from Videos by Instructions (ROVI) to facilitate training and evaluation for the proposed tasks. This is the first dataset of its kind, containing triplets of original videos, removal expressions, and inpainted videos. 

3. Presenting a diffusion-based architecture called LGVI as a baseline model for the proposed task. The paper also shows how one could leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve language guidance for interactive video inpainting, resulting in an extension called LGVI-I. To the authors' knowledge, LGVI is the first model to perform end-to-end language-driven video inpainting.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel language-driven video inpainting task, the corresponding ROVI dataset, and baseline LGVI/LGVI-I models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Language-driven video inpainting - The core task proposed in the paper, which uses natural language instructions to guide the video inpainting process instead of manually labeled masks.

- Referring video inpainting - One of the two subtasks under language-driven video inpainting. It takes simple referring expressions as input to specify inpainting areas. 

- Interactive video inpainting - The second subtask, which considers more complex, conversation-like interactions with the user to accomplish inpainting.

- ROVI dataset - The new dataset introduced in the paper containing triplets of original videos, removal expressions, and inpainted results to facilitate training and evaluation.

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) - Models like LLaVA that can process both visual and textual data, leveraged in the interactive subtask to understand user requests.

- LGVI / LGVI-I - The baseline diffusion-based models proposed for referring and interactive video inpainting respectively. LGVI-I incorporates an MLLM.

- Temporal attention - A module introduced in LGVI between the cross-attention and feedforward layers to ensure temporal consistency in output videos.

- Mask prediction / supervision - An explicit signal added to LGVI to predict the segmentation mask and guide the inpainting area based on language input.
