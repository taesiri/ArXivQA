# [Neural Operators with Localized Integral and Differential Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing neural operator architectures like Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) use global operations which can oversmooth local details. This is problematic for many scientific applications like PDEs where the operators are often local.
- Other methods like CNNs are local but can't handle varying resolutions without degradation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops two types of layers to capture local operations while retaining neural operator properties:
   1. Differential layer: Inspired by finite difference methods, this constrains and rescales regular conv layers to converge to a differential operator under refinement.
   2. Integral layer: Uses a fixed kernel with discrete-continuous convolutions to realize local integral operators. Can handle different meshes and geometries.

Main Contributions:
- Provides theory to derive conditions under which convolutional layers converge to differential operators, allowing neural operators to learn derivatives.
- Adapts discrete-continuous convolutions for efficient local integral operators in neural networks, generalizable to meshes and spheres.
- Incorporates both types of localized layers into Fourier Neural Operators.
- Achieves 34-72% lower error compared to baseline FNOs on benchmark PDEs, highlighting the value of this inductive bias.
- Shows improved generalizability via better performance on zero-shot super-resolution tasks.

In summary, the paper develops a principled approach to incorporate local operations in neural operators using differential and integral kernel layers. This helps capture small-scale solution features while retaining discretization invariance, as demonstrated through substantially improved performance on turbulent fluid flow equations.
