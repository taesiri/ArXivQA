# [Navigating the EU AI Act: A Methodological Approach to Compliance for   Safety-critical Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The EU AI Act introduces new regulations for AI systems, especially those deemed high-risk. However, the requirements in the Act are high-level and do not provide guidance on how to achieve compliance. 
- Safety-critical AI systems typically involve complex supply chains with multiple stakeholders. Demonstrating compliance across stakeholders is challenging.
- A methodology is needed to systematically derive verifiable technical requirements from the EU AI Act that considers different stakeholders.

Proposed Solution:
- An extended quality model for AI systems is introduced which incorporates attributes relevant to the EU AI Act like transparency, oversight, fairness etc.
- EU AI Act articles are mapped to relevant quality attributes in the extended model. This allows requirements to be refined into measurable characteristics.
- A contract-based approach is proposed for deriving stakeholder-specific technical requirements from quality attributes using "design contracts". These define guarantees and assumptions between stakeholders.

Key Contributions:
- Extended quality model for safety-critical AI systems covering EU AI Act requirements
- Systematic mapping of EU AI Act articles to quality attributes in extended model
- Contract-based methodology to derive verifiable technical requirements across supply chain stakeholders 
- Demonstration of methodology on automotive use case with design contracts for different stakeholders

Overall, the paper bridges the gap between regulatory requirements in the EU AI Act and their implementation by stakeholders. The extended quality model and contract-based approach systematic compliance across complex AI supply chains.
