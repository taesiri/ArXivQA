# [Learning-Augmented Algorithms with Explicit Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies online algorithmic problems in the context of learning-augmented algorithms. Specifically, it considers algorithms that have access to predictions obtained from machine learning models that are trained on historical data. Prior works in this area treat the predictor as a black-box and do not explicitly model the process of generating predictions. This paper argues that unpacking the predictor and integrating the learning task with the algorithmic challenge can lead to better performing and simpler algorithms.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to split the algorithm into two modular parts - a predictor and the online algorithm. The predictor's role is to produce predictions by learning patterns from a provided hypothesis class using the input seen so far. The hypothesis class is derived from historical data and represents possible characteristics of the input. The online algorithm then uses these predictions to serve the input sequence. 

The paper designs tailored learning tasks and predictors for three fundamental online problems - caching, load balancing, and non-clairvoyant scheduling. For each problem, it shows how an appropriately designed predictor can be integrated with a simple online algorithm to obtain strong performance guarantees. A key contribution is the clean separation of concerns between learning and algorithm design.

Main Results:
1) New caching algorithm that achieves additive regret bound compared to offline optimum. Outperforms prior approaches when input length is sufficiently long.

2) New load balancing algorithm that uses job type frequency predictions. Achieves O(log l) competitive ratio improvement over the offline optimum based on the prediction quality.  

3) New non-clairvoyant scheduling algorithm that learns to predict job ordering over time. Achieves near-optimal additive regret bounds based on prediction quality.

The performance bounds explicitly account for the prediction quality and degrade gracefully. The paper also shows lower bounds demonstrating near-optimality of the proposed approaches. Overall, it provides a new perspective on integrating predictions with online algorithms through modular design.
