# [Learning from Polar Representation: An Extreme-Adaptive Model for   Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08763)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Distance-weighted Auto-regularized Neural network (DAN) for long-term time series forecasting, with a focus on handling extreme events in hydrologic streamflow data. DAN employs an expandable encoder-decoder architecture to generate separate polar representations for extreme and normal values from the input time series. It also refines an indicator sequence to help discriminate between extreme and normal regions. These representations are merged using a distance-weighted multi-loss function that acts as an effective regularizer while emphasizing extreme values. To handle the imbalance between extreme and normal data points, DAN utilizes a Kruskal-Wallis oversampling technique. Experiments on four real-world streamflow datasets with heavy-tailed distributions show that DAN achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE and MAPE. Ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the key components of DAN's architecture like the refinement module, representation merging, and regularization scheme. The expandable encoder-decoder framework makes DAN well-suited for accurate long-term forecasting in the presence of extreme events.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Forecasting long-term streamflow is challenging due to the presence of extreme events like floods and droughts. Existing methods struggle to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies while also modeling rare but extreme events. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel model called Distance-weighted Auto-regularized Neural Network (DAN) for long-term time series forecasting that is robust to extreme events. 

- DAN has two main stages - RepGen and RepMerg. RepGen uses parallel encoder-decoder blocks to learn separate representations for normal values (near points) and extreme values (far points). It also refines indicator sequences from exogenous data. 

- RepMerg merges the representations from RepGen using a distance-weighted multi-loss mechanism to produce the final forecasts. 

Key Contributions:
- Representation learning method to extract extreme and normal latent features which are then preserved and combined in RepMerg stage.

- Distance-weighted multi-loss function to regularize model and improve robustness. Includes losses on far point forecast, near point forecast, weighted forecast, and indicator forecast.

- Kruskal-Wallis sampling policy to handle imbalanced extreme data distribution. Samples periods with more extreme events.

- Expandable encoder-decoder framework that allows iterative refinement of indicators.

- Evaluation on 4 real-world hydrologic datasets shows DAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting.
