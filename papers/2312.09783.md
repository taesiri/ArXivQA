# [Keep the Faith: Faithful Explanations in Convolutional Neural Networks   for Case-Based Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explaining predictions of black-box neural networks is important for decision-critical applications like medical diagnosis. 
- Prior work shows humans prefer example-based explanations over pixel-wise attribution maps. 
- ProtoPNet implements case-based reasoning by learning class-representative prototypes and explaining predictions by showing most similar prototypes.
- However, ProtoPNet's pixel-level explanations do not adhere to established explainability axioms and thus cannot be considered faithful.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors prove ProtoPNet's explanations violate axioms like dummy, completeness and sensitivity.
- They propose a new method called ProtoPFaith to extract faithful explanations based on Shapley values of prototype distances. 
- This involves converting ProtoPNet into a probabilistic model and using DASP to efficiently approximate Shapley values.
- Closed-form solutions for uncertainty propagation are derived for key ProtoPNet layers like squared L2 norm and ReLU1.

Main Contributions:
- First work to formally evaluate faithfulness of case-based reasoning explanations using ProtoPNet as an example.
- Proof that ProtoPNet explanations violate key axioms and introduction of ProtoPFaith method to resolve this.  
- Novel application of uncertainty propagation methods to enable efficient approximation of prototype distance Shapley values.
- Experiments on 3 datasets and 5 architectures demonstrating substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between ProtoPNet and ProtoPFaith explanations.
- ProtoPFaith explanations consistently outperform ProtoPNet on Area Over the Perturbation Curve metric by over 1000x.

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution towards ensuring the faithfulness of case-based reasoning explanations by introducing the ProtoPFaith method and experimentally validating its superior performance over ProtoPNet.
