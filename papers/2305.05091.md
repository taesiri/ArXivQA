# [Knowledge-enhanced Agents for Interactive Text Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05091)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can knowledge injection improve the performance of learning agents in semi-Markov interactive text games? 

More specifically, the authors investigate whether injecting knowledge about object affordances and memory of previous correct actions can enhance the coherence, contextual awareness, and learning abilities of different agent architectures in text-based game environments. 

The main hypothesis appears to be that incorporating these two types of domain knowledge will allow the agents to achieve improved functional grounding, make more informed decisions, and learn more effectively from environmental feedback. 

The authors test this hypothesis by devising knowledge injection strategies for three different agent architectures - a pure reinforcement learning agent, a knowledge graph-enhanced RL agent, and a language model. They perform experiments across a range of science-themed tasks in the ScienceWorld environment to evaluate the impact of the knowledge injection techniques.

So in summary, the central research question is about studying if and how knowledge injection can improve agent performance in interactive fiction games, with a focus on object affordances and correct action memory. The hypothesis is that properly incorporating such knowledge will lead to benefits in coherence, context awareness, and learning for the agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

2. Multiple knowledge injection strategies are explored, including augmenting the input encoding, adding new input components, and integrating knowledge via the knowledge graph.

3. Extensive experiments are performed on 10 elementary school science tasks from the ScienceWorld environment to evaluate the impact of injected knowledge across tasks, architectures, and strategies. 

4. The results provide insights into the complementary strengths of different architectures and knowledge types. Incorporating affordances led to the biggest improvements overall. The injection method needs to be tailored to the architecture.

5. The framework enables analyzing knowledge injection techniques for interactive agents, with implications for developing more effective natural language systems. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive framework to analyze knowledge injection methods for learning-based agents in interactive text games, providing insights through rigorous experiments across tasks, architectures, and injection techniques. The framework and analysis have important implications for developing more capable natural language interactive agents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research in natural language processing for text-based games:

- Focus on knowledge injection in semi-Markov text games: This paper specifically looks at injecting knowledge like affordances and action memory into agents for semi-Markov (games with additional temporal structure) text-based games. Most prior work has focused on standard Markov text games. Examining semi-Markov dynamics and knowledge injection is novel.

- Diversity of methods: The paper explores knowledge injection across three very different architectures - deep reinforcement learning (DRRN), knowledge graph-enhanced RL (KG-A2C), and large language models (RoBERTa). Looking at knowledge effects across diverse architectures provides unique insights. 

- Rigorous evaluation on a standardized testbed: The authors perform extensive experiments across 30 task variants spanning 10 distinct tasks in the ScienceWorld environment. Using this standardized testbed enables direct comparison to prior work and allows thorough analysis.

- Study of different integration strategies: The paper examines various techniques to integrate knowledge - as separate inputs, via knowledge graphs, through auxiliary pretraining objectives, etc. Comparing these integration strategies provides valuable understanding.

- Release of resources: The authors plan to release code, augmented baselines, knowledge graphs, object affordances, etc. upon publication. Releasing these resources benefits the research community.

Overall, this paper provides novel contributions around knowledge injection in interactive agents on a rigorous experimental testbed, exploring multiple methods and knowledge integration strategies. The diversity of architectures and depth of analysis builds on and extends related work in an impactful way.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the authors propose the following future research directions:

1. Combining reinforcement learning (RL) and language models (LMs): The paper notes that the different model types (RL, KG, LM) had complementary strengths and weaknesses on different tasks. To leverage their strengths, the authors suggest enhancing LMs by incorporating an RL policy network.

2. Training models jointly across tasks: The authors currently train separate models per task, but propose joint training across tasks could improve generalization, as they observed initial promising results on their RoBERTa model.

3. Exploring few-shot prompting: Large LMs have shown promise in few-shot settings for reasoning tasks. The authors suggest exploring their potential in interactive IF games, either as solutions requiring less training data or as components to generate synthetic data for knowledge distillation.

4. Releasing code and data: To enable follow-up research, the authors will release code for their models, augmented baselines, object affordance data, knowledge graphs, and model checkpoints.

In summary, the main future directions are combining complementary model architectures, training models jointly across tasks, utilizing few-shot prompting strategies, and releasing artifacts to facilitate further research in this area. The authors aim to pursue techniques for more coherent, contextually-appropriate, and sample-efficient models for interactive fiction games.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper investigates approaches for injecting knowledge into learning agents to improve their performance in semi-Markov text-based interactive games. The authors focus on incorporating two types of knowledge - affordances of objects in the environment and memory of the agent's previous correct actions. They integrate knowledge injection strategies into three model architectures: a deep reinforcement learning agent (DRRN), a knowledge graph-enhanced RL agent (KG-A2C), and a pretrained language model (RoBERTa). Multiple methods are explored for encoding the knowledge as part of the model inputs or via the knowledge graph. Experiments are conducted across 10 subtasks in the ScienceWorld environment to analyze the impact of knowledge injection. The results demonstrate improved performance over baseline models in the majority of cases when incorporating affordance and/or correct action memory, with the biggest gains from affordances. The paper provides insights into effective knowledge integration strategies for different model architectures and task types in interactive text games.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper explores techniques for knowledge injection in learning agents for interactive text games. Specifically, it looks at injecting two types of knowledge - memory of previous correct actions, and affordances of objects - into three types of architectures: reinforcement learning (RL), knowledge graph-enhanced RL, and language models. The goal is to improve the agents' coherence, contextual awareness, and ability to learn effectively from environment feedback. Experiments are conducted in the ScienceWorld environment across 10 science-related tasks. 

The results show that knowledge injection, especially affordances, improves performance in most cases. The effectiveness varies by architecture and task - affordances help RL the most by narrowing the action space; language models also benefit as affordances improve understanding. The memory of correct actions helps less overall. However, it boosts language models more than RL, likely due to the shorter tasks. The findings provide insights into how knowledge injection can enable more effective natural language processing systems for interactive contexts. Future work may explore joint training over tasks and few-shot prompting of large language models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to analyze and evaluate different techniques for injecting knowledge into agents for interactive fiction games. The framework focuses on injecting two types of knowledge - affordances of objects and memory of previous successful actions - into three agent architectures: a deep reinforcement learning agent (DRRN), a knowledge graph-enhanced reinforcement learning agent (KG-A2C), and a pretrained language model (RoBERTa). The affordance knowledge provides information about possible interactions with objects, while the memory of successful actions helps reinforce optimal behaviors. Multiple strategies are explored for injecting this knowledge, including encoding it as separate inputs, incorporating it into the knowledge graph representation, and using auxiliary pretraining objectives. Experiments are conducted in the ScienceWorld environment across 30 subtasks spanning scientific concepts to analyze the impact of knowledge injection. Results show that incorporating affordance knowledge led to the biggest improvements in performance, especially when added to the knowledge graph for the RL agent and via pretraining for the language model. The memory of successful actions also helped but to a lesser extent. The findings provide insights into effective techniques for knowledge injection to improve agent coherence, contextual awareness, and learning in interactive games.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key focus of this paper appears to be exploring methods to improve the performance of learning agents in semi-Markov text-based games. In particular, it investigates how the injection of different types of knowledge can enhance the agents' ability to generate coherent, contextually-appropriate actions and learn effectively from environmental feedback. 

The paper notes that while language models possess extensive semantic knowledge that could be useful for text-based games, prior work has shown they struggle with grounded reasoning or explaining scientific concepts in these interactive fiction (IF) environments. Similarly, reinforcement learning agents face challenges managing large action spaces and finding optimal policies. 

To address these limitations, the paper proposes a framework to analyze techniques for knowledge injection, specifically focused on injecting "memory of previous correct actions" and "affordances of relevant objects." It integrates these injection strategies into three model architectures: reinforcement learning, knowledge graph-enhanced reinforcement learning, and language modeling.

The key research questions seem to be:

- How can the injection of domain knowledge about previous actions and object affordances improve the coherence, contextual awareness, and learning capabilities of agents in text-based games? 

- What are effective methods for integrating this knowledge across different agent architectures?

- How do different knowledge injection strategies impact performance across various interactive tasks?

By conducting experiments on elementary school science tasks, the paper aims to provide insights into these questions and ultimately enable more effective natural language processing systems for interactive contexts.
