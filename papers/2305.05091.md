# Knowledge-enhanced Agents for Interactive Text Games

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can knowledge injection improve the performance of learning agents in semi-Markov interactive text games? More specifically, the authors investigate whether injecting knowledge about object affordances and memory of previous correct actions can enhance the coherence, contextual awareness, and learning abilities of different agent architectures in text-based game environments. The main hypothesis appears to be that incorporating these two types of domain knowledge will allow the agents to achieve improved functional grounding, make more informed decisions, and learn more effectively from environmental feedback. The authors test this hypothesis by devising knowledge injection strategies for three different agent architectures - a pure reinforcement learning agent, a knowledge graph-enhanced RL agent, and a language model. They perform experiments across a range of science-themed tasks in the ScienceWorld environment to evaluate the impact of the knowledge injection techniques.So in summary, the central research question is about studying if and how knowledge injection can improve agent performance in interactive fiction games, with a focus on object affordances and correct action memory. The hypothesis is that properly incorporating such knowledge will lead to benefits in coherence, context awareness, and learning for the agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a framework to analyze the effectiveness of knowledge injection techniques in learning-based agents for improving their performance in semi-Markov interactive text games. Specifically, the key aspects are:1. The authors focus on injecting two types of knowledge - memory of previous correct actions and affordances of objects - into three model architectures: reinforcement learning (DRRN), knowledge graph-enhanced RL (KG-A2C), and language model (RoBERTa). 2. Multiple knowledge injection strategies are explored, including augmenting the input encoding, adding new input components, and integrating knowledge via the knowledge graph.3. Extensive experiments are performed on 10 elementary school science tasks from the ScienceWorld environment to evaluate the impact of injected knowledge across tasks, architectures, and strategies. 4. The results provide insights into the complementary strengths of different architectures and knowledge types. Incorporating affordances led to the biggest improvements overall. The injection method needs to be tailored to the architecture.5. The framework enables analyzing knowledge injection techniques for interactive agents, with implications for developing more effective natural language systems. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive framework to analyze knowledge injection methods for learning-based agents in interactive text games, providing insights through rigorous experiments across tasks, architectures, and injection techniques. The framework and analysis have important implications for developing more capable natural language interactive agents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research in natural language processing for text-based games:- Focus on knowledge injection in semi-Markov text games: This paper specifically looks at injecting knowledge like affordances and action memory into agents for semi-Markov (games with additional temporal structure) text-based games. Most prior work has focused on standard Markov text games. Examining semi-Markov dynamics and knowledge injection is novel.- Diversity of methods: The paper explores knowledge injection across three very different architectures - deep reinforcement learning (DRRN), knowledge graph-enhanced RL (KG-A2C), and large language models (RoBERTa). Looking at knowledge effects across diverse architectures provides unique insights. - Rigorous evaluation on a standardized testbed: The authors perform extensive experiments across 30 task variants spanning 10 distinct tasks in the ScienceWorld environment. Using this standardized testbed enables direct comparison to prior work and allows thorough analysis.- Study of different integration strategies: The paper examines various techniques to integrate knowledge - as separate inputs, via knowledge graphs, through auxiliary pretraining objectives, etc. Comparing these integration strategies provides valuable understanding.- Release of resources: The authors plan to release code, augmented baselines, knowledge graphs, object affordances, etc. upon publication. Releasing these resources benefits the research community.Overall, this paper provides novel contributions around knowledge injection in interactive agents on a rigorous experimental testbed, exploring multiple methods and knowledge integration strategies. The diversity of architectures and depth of analysis builds on and extends related work in an impactful way.
