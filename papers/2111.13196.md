# [SwinBERT: End-to-End Transformers with Sparse Attention for Video   Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13196)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key points and contributions of this paper are:- It proposes SwinBERT, a new end-to-end transformer-based architecture for video captioning. Rather than using offline extracted 2D/3D video features like prior works, it takes raw video frames as input and outputs natural language descriptions.- It investigates how many video frames are needed for good video captioning performance. Experiments show captioning benefits from more densely sampled frames, unlike prior successes with sparse sampling for video-language tasks like QA.- It introduces a learnable Sparse Attention Mask to focus on more informative tokens and reduce redundancy in consecutive video frames. This improves long-range sequence modeling.- Extensive experiments on 5 datasets show SwinBERT outperforms prior state-of-the-art by a large margin. The sparse attention mask brings consistent gains and can transfer across different frame rates and datasets.In summary, the key hypothesis is that an end-to-end transformer taking raw video frames as input can outperform prior methods relying on offline extracted features. The sparse attention mask further improves sequence modeling and captioning performance. Experiments validate these hypotheses and show significant gains over previous state-of-the-art approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes SwinBERT, the first end-to-end pure Transformer-based model for video captioning. Previous methods rely on offline extracted 2D/3D features from video frames, whereas SwinBERT takes raw video frames as input and is trained end-to-end. 2. It introduces a learnable Sparse Attention Mask as a regularizer to improve long-range video sequence modeling. The sparsity constraint helps discover underlying structure and focus on more informative tokens. Experiments show the proposed sparse attention mask consistently improves results.3. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrate SwinBERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. For example, it achieves absolute CIDEr gains of +25.4 on MSVD, +55.4 on YouCook2, +5.9 on TVC, and +14.9 on VATEX.4. Analysis reveals video captioning benefits from dense frame sampling, unlike sparse sampling commonly used for other video-language tasks. SwinBERT leverages up to 64 raw video frames.5. The learned sparse attention patterns generalize across different frame rates and datasets. This demonstrates the regularizer's flexibility.In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end Transformer for video captioning, enabled by a learnable sparse attention mask that improves sequence modeling. SwinBERT outperforms previous methods significantly across benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes SwinBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for video captioning that takes raw video frames as input and introduces a learnable sparse attention mask to improve long-range video sequence modeling, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis comparing the paper to other research in video captioning:- The key novelty is proposing an end-to-end pure transformer architecture (SwinBERT) directly from raw video frames, without relying on pre-extracted features. Most prior work uses features from pre-trained models.- They show superior performance by using denser sampling of frames (64 frames) compared to sparse sampling in prior work like ClipBERT. This suggests more frames are better for captioning even though sparse sampling works for other V+L tasks.- Introducing a learnable sparse attention mask is a new technique to handle long sequences and reduce redundancy between frames. Prior work uses predefined attention patterns or full attention. The learned mask focuses on more informative regions.- Achieves new SOTA results on MSVD, YouCook2, TVC and VATEX using only visual inputs. Many prior works use both visual and textual inputs. Demonstrates the strength of the end-to-end visual modeling.- Model transfers well when changing number of frames and across datasets, by reusing the learned attention masks. Shows the generalizability of the learned attention patterns.Overall, it pushes the state-of-the-art in video captioning through innovations in end-to-end architecture and attention modeling. The use of pure transformers and techniques like learned sparse attention are promising directions for advancing video and language research.
