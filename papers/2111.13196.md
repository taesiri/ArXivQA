# [SwinBERT: End-to-End Transformers with Sparse Attention for Video   Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13196)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key points and contributions of this paper are:- It proposes SwinBERT, a new end-to-end transformer-based architecture for video captioning. Rather than using offline extracted 2D/3D video features like prior works, it takes raw video frames as input and outputs natural language descriptions.- It investigates how many video frames are needed for good video captioning performance. Experiments show captioning benefits from more densely sampled frames, unlike prior successes with sparse sampling for video-language tasks like QA.- It introduces a learnable Sparse Attention Mask to focus on more informative tokens and reduce redundancy in consecutive video frames. This improves long-range sequence modeling.- Extensive experiments on 5 datasets show SwinBERT outperforms prior state-of-the-art by a large margin. The sparse attention mask brings consistent gains and can transfer across different frame rates and datasets.In summary, the key hypothesis is that an end-to-end transformer taking raw video frames as input can outperform prior methods relying on offline extracted features. The sparse attention mask further improves sequence modeling and captioning performance. Experiments validate these hypotheses and show significant gains over previous state-of-the-art approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes SwinBERT, the first end-to-end pure Transformer-based model for video captioning. Previous methods rely on offline extracted 2D/3D features from video frames, whereas SwinBERT takes raw video frames as input and is trained end-to-end. 2. It introduces a learnable Sparse Attention Mask as a regularizer to improve long-range video sequence modeling. The sparsity constraint helps discover underlying structure and focus on more informative tokens. Experiments show the proposed sparse attention mask consistently improves results.3. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrate SwinBERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. For example, it achieves absolute CIDEr gains of +25.4 on MSVD, +55.4 on YouCook2, +5.9 on TVC, and +14.9 on VATEX.4. Analysis reveals video captioning benefits from dense frame sampling, unlike sparse sampling commonly used for other video-language tasks. SwinBERT leverages up to 64 raw video frames.5. The learned sparse attention patterns generalize across different frame rates and datasets. This demonstrates the regularizer's flexibility.In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end Transformer for video captioning, enabled by a learnable sparse attention mask that improves sequence modeling. SwinBERT outperforms previous methods significantly across benchmarks.
