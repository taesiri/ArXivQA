# [Automatic Functional Differentiation in JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18727)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces AutoFD, a system to perform automatic functional differentiation by extending JAX's capabilities. It represents functions as generalized arrays, allowing JAX's existing primitive system for automatic differentiation to be applied to higher-order functions like functionals and operators. The authors define a core set of primitive operators with derived linearization (JVP) and transposition rules that serve as building blocks for common types of functionals. These include compose, gradient, linearize, linear transpose, and integrate operators. Together, they can represent widely-used semi-local and linear non-local functionals. AutoFD allows computing functional derivatives with the same syntax as traditional functions, producing functional gradient functions ready for invocation. It avoids the complexity of symbolic derivation. The authors showcase applications in solving variational problems, density functional theory calculations, and differentiating complex nonlocal neural functionals. Overall, AutoFD brings the power and simplicity of automatic differentiation to the function space, opening opportunities for new methods relying on functional optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces automatic functional differentiation (AutoFD) in JAX by representing functions as generalized arrays, implementing primitive operators for function composition, differentiation, linearization, transposition, and integration with associated JVP and transpose rules, enabling computation of functional derivatives with the same syntax as regular automatic differentiation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is extending JAX with the capability to automatically differentiate higher-order functions (functionals and operators). Specifically:

- It represents functions as a generalization of arrays in JAX, allowing JAX's existing primitive system for automatic differentiation to be seamlessly applied to functions. 

- It introduces a core set of primitive operators (compose, nabla/derivative, linearize, linear transpose, integrate) that serve as building blocks for constructing common types of functionals and operators.

- For each primitive operator, it derives and implements linearization rules (for forward mode automatic differentiation) and transpose rules (for reverse mode). This aligns with JAX's internal protocols.

- It shows how this allows functional differentiation with the same syntax traditionally used for plain functions in JAX. The resulting functional gradients are themselves functions that can be invoked.

- It demonstrates the efficacy and simplicity of this approach on applications where functional derivatives are important, such as solving variational problems and in density functional theory.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling JAX's automatic differentiation machinery to work on functions by representing them as generalized arrays, and providing the necessary primitive operators and rules to make this possible. This helps close the gap between theory and practice for functional differentiation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Automatic functional differentiation (AutoFD) - The main focus of the paper is developing tools and techniques for automatically computing derivatives of higher-order functions like functionals and operators, which the authors refer to as "automatic functional differentiation".

- Functionals - Functions whose inputs and/or outputs are other functions rather than just scalars or tensors. The paper aims to enable easy differentiation with respect to function inputs.

- Operators - Similar to functionals, mappings from functions to functions.

- Fréchet derivatives - The generalization of regular derivatives to functions operating on other functions rather than just scalars. Computing Fréchet derivatives is key to the automatic functional differentiation approach.

- Adjoint operators - The higher-order generalization of matrix transposition. Computing adjoint operators is important for supporting reverse-mode automatic differentiation. 

- Primitive operators - The core set of functional operators like composition, differentiation, integration, etc. that serve as building blocks for constructing more complex functionals and enabling their differentiation.

- Linearization rules - Rules for computing forward-mode derivatives of operations, also called Jacobian-vector products (JVPs). Key for supporting forward-mode automatic differentiation.

- Transpose rules - Rules for reversing or "transposing" operations, used to derive reverse-mode gradients from forward-mode gradients.

So in summary - automatic functional differentiation, functionals, operators, Fréchet derivatives, adjoint operators, primitive operators, linearization rules, and transpose rules.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes representing functions as a generalization of arrays in order to reuse JAX's AD machinery for automatic functional differentiation. What are the limitations of this array-based function representation? Does it restrict the types of functions that can be differentiated?

2. The paper introduces several key primitive operators like compose, nabla, linearize etc. along with their JVP and transpose rules. Why is it important that these operators are implemented as primitives? What would be the downsides of implementing them in pure Python instead?

3. The completeness analysis in Section 4.2 identifies some limitations around function inversion and analytical integration. How severe are these limitations? What extensions could address them in future work? 

4. Section 5.3 discusses opportunities for optimizing computation graphs with mixed-order differentiation. What specific techniques like the Faà di Bruno formula could be applied here? How much speedup might be possible?

5. For the variational optimization example in Section 6.1, what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of the three presented gradient estimation strategies (eqns 6, 7 and 8)? When would each be preferred?

6. How does the automatic functional differentiation approach compare to symbolic mathematical software like Mathematica or Maple for the density functional theory example in Section 6.2? What are limitations and advantages?

7. The nonlocal neural functional example in Section 6.3 and Appendix D demonstrates quickly growing complexity. Could techniques like checkpointing or dynamic computation graphs help? What alterations might improve training?

8. What techniques from traditional numerical analysis could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of integration? How easy is it to incorporate such techniques in the system?

9. The related works comparison in Section 7 is limited. What other related compiler and language based approaches exist? How do they compare?

10. Beyond the discussed limitations in Section 8, what other theoretical and practical challenges exist for making automatic functional differentiation mainstream? How might they be addressed?
