# [DetZero: Rethinking Offboard 3D Object Detection with Long-term   Sequential Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06023)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we design an offboard 3D object detection system to fully activate the potential of long-term sequential point clouds for autonomous driving perception? 

Specifically, the authors identify two main limitations of prior offboard 3D detection systems:

1. The onboard multi-object tracker cannot generate sufficient complete object trajectories due to issues like ID switches and fragmentation. 

2. The motion state of objects poses challenges for the object-centric refining stage to effectively leverage long-term temporal context. 

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new offboard 3D detection paradigm called DetZero, which contains:

1. A multi-frame detector + offline tracker to generate accurate and complete object tracks.

2. An attention-based attribute refining module to refine object geometry, trajectory, and confidence by decomposing the task and reasoning about long-term contexts.

Through experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the authors demonstrate DetZero achieves new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior offboard and onboard methods significantly. The core hypothesis is that emphasizing high-recall upstream and meticulous high-accuracy downstream refining can better activate the potential of long-term sequential point clouds for offboard 3D detection.

In summary, the central research question is how to design an offboard 3D detection system that can make full use of long-term sequential point clouds by addressing limitations in existing systems related to tracking and context modeling. The core ideas are improving tracking completeness and using decomposed attribute refining with long-term contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new paradigm for offboard 3D object detection called DetZero to better utilize long-term sequential point clouds. The main contributions are:

- They propose a multi-frame object detector and offline tracker to generate more accurate and complete object tracks, which is crucial for the downstream refinement.

- They propose an attention-mechanism based refining module that refines object attributes (geometry, motion, confidence) by leveraging long-term temporal contexts in the sequential point clouds. 

- They achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Dataset for both 3D object detection and tracking, outperforming prior state-of-the-art by a large margin.

- Their method can provide high-quality "auto labels" that are comparable or even slightly better than human labels for training onboard models in a semi-supervised setting.

- Their extensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of the proposed upstream tracking and downstream refining components.

In summary, the key innovation is the new paradigm of generating complete tracks first and then refining object attributes by effectively exploiting long-term contexts, which allows their method to significantly push the state-of-the-art in offboard 3D perception.
