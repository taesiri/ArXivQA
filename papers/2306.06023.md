# [DetZero: Rethinking Offboard 3D Object Detection with Long-term   Sequential Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06023)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we design an offboard 3D object detection system to fully activate the potential of long-term sequential point clouds for autonomous driving perception? 

Specifically, the authors identify two main limitations of prior offboard 3D detection systems:

1. The onboard multi-object tracker cannot generate sufficient complete object trajectories due to issues like ID switches and fragmentation. 

2. The motion state of objects poses challenges for the object-centric refining stage to effectively leverage long-term temporal context. 

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new offboard 3D detection paradigm called DetZero, which contains:

1. A multi-frame detector + offline tracker to generate accurate and complete object tracks.

2. An attention-based attribute refining module to refine object geometry, trajectory, and confidence by decomposing the task and reasoning about long-term contexts.

Through experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the authors demonstrate DetZero achieves new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior offboard and onboard methods significantly. The core hypothesis is that emphasizing high-recall upstream and meticulous high-accuracy downstream refining can better activate the potential of long-term sequential point clouds for offboard 3D detection.

In summary, the central research question is how to design an offboard 3D detection system that can make full use of long-term sequential point clouds by addressing limitations in existing systems related to tracking and context modeling. The core ideas are improving tracking completeness and using decomposed attribute refining with long-term contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new paradigm for offboard 3D object detection called DetZero to better utilize long-term sequential point clouds. The main contributions are:

- They propose a multi-frame object detector and offline tracker to generate more accurate and complete object tracks, which is crucial for the downstream refinement.

- They propose an attention-mechanism based refining module that refines object attributes (geometry, motion, confidence) by leveraging long-term temporal contexts in the sequential point clouds. 

- They achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Dataset for both 3D object detection and tracking, outperforming prior state-of-the-art by a large margin.

- Their method can provide high-quality "auto labels" that are comparable or even slightly better than human labels for training onboard models in a semi-supervised setting.

- It proposes novel components like an offline tracker for complete tracks, attention-based networks for attribute refining, and encoding point clouds with proposal information. These help effectively leverage long-term context.

- It shows the refined boxes can supervise detector training as well as human labels, demonstrating their high quality. Prior works focused on generating "auto labels" but didn't compare them directly to human labels.

- The ablation studies analyze the contribution of different components. The paper also examines generalization to different upstream detections and metrics like higher IoU thresholds. This provides more insights compared to just reporting leaderboard metrics.

Overall, the key novelties are in the paradigm, architecture designs, thorough benchmarking, and analysis. The paper pushes the state-of-the-art in long-term point cloud perception and provides useful takeaways for future research in this direction.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes DetZero, a new offboard 3D object detection method that leverages long-term sequential point clouds. The authors identify two key issues limiting current offboard detectors: incomplete object tracks from the onboard tracker, and the use of separate models to refine static vs dynamic objects which ignores their similarities. To address the first issue, they propose using a multi-frame detector and offline tracker to generate more complete object tracks. For the second issue, they propose an attention-based refining module that decomposes bounding box refinement into geometry size, trajectory smoothness, and confidence score predictions. This allows exploiting geometric consistency, motion patterns, and leveraging all data regardless of object state. 

The authors evaluate DetZero on the Waymo Open Dataset where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other offboard and online methods. They perform extensive experiments analyzing the contribution of each component. Notably, DetZero ranks 1st on the Waymo 3D detection leaderboard, demonstrating its effectiveness. The auto-labels it generates also outperform human labels when used to train an onboard detector, suggesting they could reduce annotation costs. Overall, the work provides interesting findings and strong performance showing the potential of rethinking conventions in offboard 3D detection.
