# [Probing and Mitigating Intersectional Social Biases in Vision-Language   Models with Counterfactual Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior studies on probing social biases in vision-language models (VLMs) have focused on single attributes like gender or race, ignoring intersectional biases (combinations of attributes). This is likely due to the difficulty of collecting real image-text pairs covering different combinations of social attributes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose using text-to-image diffusion models to automatically generate counterfactual image-text pairs depicting occupations with different combinations of social attributes related to gender, race and physical characteristics. 

- They use Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to produce sets of images that differ only in the social attributes, keeping other details constant. This allows precisely probing the impact of attribute changes on model biases.

- The authors apply a 3-stage filtering process, including CLIP similarity checks, NSFW filtering and CLIP-based attribute detectability filtering, to ensure only high-quality counterfactuals are retained.

Contributions:
- The authors construct SocialCounterfactuals, a dataset with over 171k synthetic counterfactual image-text pairs covering intersectional biases related to gender, race and physical characteristics across 158 occupations.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset can effectively uncover intersectional biases in 6 VLMs. All models exhibit skewed retrieval results, with substantial variation across different race-gender combinations.

- Additional training experiments show the dataset can also mitigate intersectional biases in VLMs. Models fine-tuned on it have up to 42.6% reduction in retrieval skew on separate test sets.

In summary, the paper introduces an automated approach to generate multimodal counterfactual data for probing intersectional biases in VLMs. It also releases the first large-scale resource explicitly focused on intersectional social biases in vision-language tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents a methodology to generate large-scale counterfactual image-text datasets using diffusion models to probe intersectional social biases in vision-language models, demonstrates the approach by producing over 170K examples for gender, race and physical characteristics, and shows the value of the synthesized dataset for both quantifying and reducing retrieval skewness related to multiple attributes in pre-trained models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) Proposing a methodology to automatically generate counterfactual image-text pairs at scale to probe intersectional social biases in vision-language models. The key ideas are:

- Using text-to-image diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) with cross attention control to generate counterfactual images that differ only in the social attributes of interest.

- Applying a 3-stage filtering process to ensure only high-quality and valid counterfactuals are retained. 

2) Generating a large-scale dataset called SocialCounterfactuals containing over 170k counterfactual image-text pairs covering intersections of gender, race, and physical characteristics across occupations. This is the largest dataset released for probing biases in VLMs.

3) Demonstrating the usefulness of SocialCounterfactuals for probing intersectional biases in VLMs - uncovering significant skewness in retrieval results that vary substantially across attributes. 

4) Showing SocialCounterfactuals can be used to mitigate intersectional biases in VLMs through additional training, leading to reductions in retrieval skewness.

In summary, the main contribution is a scalable methodology and dataset for probing and mitigating intersectional biases in VLMs using synthetically generated counterfactuals.

The paper focuses on probing and mitigating intersectional social biases related to attributes like race, gender, and physical characteristics in vision-language models. It uses text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to generate counterfactual image-text examples at scale for different occupations. The key methodology is over-generating images followed by multi-stage filtering. The resulting dataset, SocialCounterfactuals, is used to probe intersectional biases in VLMs by estimating skewness in retrieval results. Experiments also demonstrate the dataset's usefulness for debiasing VLMs through additional finetuning. So the core focus is on synthetic counterfactual data generation and its applications for analyzing and mitigating biases in VLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 3-stage filtering process after generating candidate images using stable diffusion. What is the rationale behind having separate stages for NSFW filtering and CLIP attribute detectability filtering? Why not combine them into a single filtering stage?

2. In the CLIP attribute detectability filtering stage, thresholds for filtering are learned based on manual annotation of a sample of 100 counterfactual sets per attribute pair. What is the sensitivity of the filtering performance to the number of manually annotated samples used? Would using 50 vs 200 sample sets lead to very different filtering thresholds and performance?

3. The paper argues text-to-image diffusion models are well-suited for generating counterfactual examples compared to other generative models. What specific advantages do diffusion models provide over other alternatives like GANs for this application? What disadvantages might they have?

4. Could the methodology be extended to generate video counterfactual examples instead of images? What challenges would need to be addressed to achieve high quality results if videos were generated instead?

5. The paper demonstrates debiasing effects on Retrieval Skewness for models trained using SocialCounterfactuals. However, what is the sensitivity of debiasing performance to the quantity of training data used from SocialCounterfactuals? 

6. For the CLIP attribute detectability filtering stage, image-text similarity scores are used to determine if an attribute is discernible. What other approaches could be used instead of or in combination with CLIP for estimating attribute detectability?

7. The paper argues that text-to-image diffusion models can depict combinations of attributes that might be rare or missing from existing paired image-text datasets. However, what are some examples of attribute combinations that would remain challenging for diffusion models to accurately generate?

8. The study focuses exclusively on English language data. What steps would need to be taken to extend the methodology for generating counterfactual examples in other languages? What new challenges might emerge?

9. The paper demonstrates reductions in Retrieval Skewness after model debiasing. However, what other evaluation metrics should be considered to quantify the robustness of models to biases, in addition to Retrieval Skewness?

10. Semi-supervised and self-supervised approaches leveraging unlabeled data have been highly effective for pre-training vision-language models. Could similar semi-supervised strategies help improve debiasing performance when using the proposed counterfactual generation methodology? What are the challenges?
