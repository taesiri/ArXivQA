# What would Harry say? Building Dialogue Agents for Characters in a Story

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main goal of this paper is to develop dialogue agents for characters in a story, using the Harry Potter series as a case study. The key ideas are:- Current dialogue systems can generate fluent and coherent responses, and some can even incorporate persona or commonsense knowledge. However, they still lack the ability to deeply understand the background and context of a conversation, including the scene, participants, and evolving storyline. - To mimic human-like conversational behaviors, dialogue agents need to take into account dynamic background information like scenes, character attributes, and relationships that change over time as a storyline progresses.- The authors create a new dataset called Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) that provides dialogues from the Harry Potter books along with rich annotations of scenes, character attributes, and relationships. The key characteristic is that this background knowledge evolves over time.- They evaluate several baseline models on HPD and find that while the models can generate fluent responses, they fail to appropriately incorporate the persona, relationships, and storyline context. This indicates significant room for improvement.In summary, the main hypothesis is that equipping dialogue agents with dynamically changing background knowledge about scenes, attributes, and relationships will allow them to have more human-like conversations playing the role of a character in an evolving story. The HPD dataset provides a testbed for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new dataset called Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) to facilitate research on building dialogue agents for characters within a story. 2. The key features of HPD are:- It contains dialogues from the Harry Potter books along with rich annotations of the dialogue scene, character attributes, and character relationships. - The scene, attributes, and relationships change dynamically as the storyline progresses, unlike previous static persona-based datasets.- It provides a well-designed test set to support evaluating both generative and retrieval dialogue models.3. The authors benchmark several strong baseline models (GPT-2, DialogGPT, BoB, BERT-FP) on HPD and show they are still far from generating Harry Potter-like responses, indicating ample room for future research.4. The fine-grained annotations could support research beyond just dialogue, like sentiment analysis of characters. Overall, HPD pushes the boundary towards more human-like dialogue agents by requiring modeling dynamic backgrounds and personas.In summary, the key contribution is the new HPD dataset that contains rich and dynamic annotation of scenes, attributes, and relationships to support research on dialogue agents situated within a story world. The experiments also demonstrate the difficulty of current models on this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a new dialogue dataset called Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) that contains rich contextual information like scenes, character attributes and relationships which change dynamically as the storyline progresses, in order to facilitate research on building dialogue agents for characters in stories.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The key contribution of this paper is the new Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) dataset for training and evaluating dialogue agents for characters in a story. This is a novel dataset that provides rich contextual information about each dialogue exchange, including scenes, character attributes, and relationships. Other datasets for personalized/character-based dialogue tend to lack this level of detail and dynamic story evolution.- Most prior work has focused on incorporating personas or personal traits into open-domain dialog systems. This paper argues that building true character-based agents requires modeling the storyline, background scenes, and evolving relationships, not just static persona descriptions. In that sense, it pushes research towards more holistic and dynamic dialogue agents.- Existing persona/personalized dialogue datasets like PersonaChat, PersonalDialog, and Kvret PI provided some character attributes but lacked detailed situational context and evolving relations. The new HPD dataset fills this gap.- Other recent work like WoW and FriendsQA incorporated some scene and relationship information but still lacked the rich details and story evolution that HPD provides.- The paper shows that current state-of-the-art models (GPT-2, DialogGPT, BOB) still fail to generate convincing dialogue responses that capture the nuances of characters, scenes, and relationships. This points to opportunities for future research.- While focused on Harry Potter, the general principles and dataset characteristics could inform research into character-based dialogue agents for other narrative story worlds as well.In summary, this paper makes a novel contribution through the new HPD dataset and clearly articulates the unique challenges of character-based dialogue that current models have yet to solve. The dataset will likely enable and inspire further research in this interesting direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:- Developing more sophisticated methods to incorporate the rich background knowledge (scenes, attributes, relations) into dialogue models. The authors show that simply adding some background knowledge as text to the input does not substantially improve the consistency of the generated responses. More advanced methods are needed.- Exploring different ways to represent the background knowledge, such as graph structures or knowledge bases, instead of just natural language descriptions. This could help the models better utilize and reason over the knowledge.- Investigating whether modeling other characters beyond just Harry Potter can produce more diverse and interactive conversations. The current work focuses only on Harry's perspective.- Scaling up the dataset to cover more characters, relationships, and story contexts. The authors created a high-quality but limited dataset so far. Expanding it could enable building more capable models.- Evaluating if incorporating the fine-grained background knowledge can improve performance on other downstream tasks like summarization, question answering, etc. related to the Harry Potter domain.- Studying if similar rich annotation of backgrounds could benefit building dialogue agents for other fictional worlds or virtual assistants. The key ideas could generalize beyond Harry Potter.In summary, the core suggested direction is improving the methods for effectively utilizing all the annotated contextual information in a dialogue model to make the conversations more consistent with the given personas, relations, and story details.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a new dataset called Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) to facilitate research on building dialogue agents for characters in stories. HPD contains rich contextual information about dialogues in the Harry Potter books, including speaker attributes, relationships between speakers, and descriptions of the scenes around the dialogues. These details are annotated by fans of the book series and change dynamically as the storyline progresses. The authors benchmark several existing dialogue models on HPD to generate Harry Potter-like responses. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations show current models are still far from producing satisfactory Harry-like responses, indicating ample room for future research in this challenging task of building story-based conversational agents. The dataset could support developing more human-like dialogue systems for applications like virtual assistants and video game NPCs.
