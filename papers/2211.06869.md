# What would Harry say? Building Dialogue Agents for Characters in a Story

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main goal of this paper is to develop dialogue agents for characters in a story, using the Harry Potter series as a case study. The key ideas are:- Current dialogue systems can generate fluent and coherent responses, and some can even incorporate persona or commonsense knowledge. However, they still lack the ability to deeply understand the background and context of a conversation, including the scene, participants, and evolving storyline. - To mimic human-like conversational behaviors, dialogue agents need to take into account dynamic background information like scenes, character attributes, and relationships that change over time as a storyline progresses.- The authors create a new dataset called Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) that provides dialogues from the Harry Potter books along with rich annotations of scenes, character attributes, and relationships. The key characteristic is that this background knowledge evolves over time.- They evaluate several baseline models on HPD and find that while the models can generate fluent responses, they fail to appropriately incorporate the persona, relationships, and storyline context. This indicates significant room for improvement.In summary, the main hypothesis is that equipping dialogue agents with dynamically changing background knowledge about scenes, attributes, and relationships will allow them to have more human-like conversations playing the role of a character in an evolving story. The HPD dataset provides a testbed for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new dataset called Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) to facilitate research on building dialogue agents for characters within a story. 2. The key features of HPD are:- It contains dialogues from the Harry Potter books along with rich annotations of the dialogue scene, character attributes, and character relationships. - The scene, attributes, and relationships change dynamically as the storyline progresses, unlike previous static persona-based datasets.- It provides a well-designed test set to support evaluating both generative and retrieval dialogue models.3. The authors benchmark several strong baseline models (GPT-2, DialogGPT, BoB, BERT-FP) on HPD and show they are still far from generating Harry Potter-like responses, indicating ample room for future research.4. The fine-grained annotations could support research beyond just dialogue, like sentiment analysis of characters. Overall, HPD pushes the boundary towards more human-like dialogue agents by requiring modeling dynamic backgrounds and personas.In summary, the key contribution is the new HPD dataset that contains rich and dynamic annotation of scenes, attributes, and relationships to support research on dialogue agents situated within a story world. The experiments also demonstrate the difficulty of current models on this task.
