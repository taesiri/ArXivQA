# [MPCViT: Searching for Accurate and Efficient MPC-Friendly Vision   Transformer with Heterogeneous Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13955)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we develop accurate yet efficient Vision Transformers (ViTs) to accelerate ViT inference under the constraints of secure multi-party computation (MPC)?

The key hypothesis is that selectively replacing or simplifying expensive operations in ViT architectures like Softmax can reduce communication overhead and latency during private inference, without compromising model accuracy. 

Specifically, the paper proposes:

- Analyzing different attention mechanisms and identifying efficient yet accurate variants for MPC.

- Developing a heterogeneous attention design space and MPC-aware neural architecture search to find optimized ViT architectures.

- Proposing techniques like knowledge distillation and GeLU optimization to further improve accuracy and efficiency.

Through extensive experiments, the paper shows their proposed MPCViT method outperforms prior ViT architectures and optimizations in accuracy and efficiency for private inference. The central goal is developing privacy-preserving yet performant ViTs for tasks like image classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here is a summary of the main contributions of this paper:

- The paper proposes an MPC-friendly Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture called MPCViT to enable accurate and efficient ViT inference under multi-party computation (MPC). 

- It analyzes different attention mechanisms and identifies Softmax attention as the major latency bottleneck due to expensive operations like exponential, max, and reciprocal in MPC.

- It proposes a heterogeneous attention optimization space with both high-accuracy ReLU Softmax attention and low-latency Scaling attention.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an MPC-friendly Vision Transformer (ViT) called MPCViT to enable efficient and accurate ViT inference with secure multi-party computation (MPC). Here are a few key ways it compares to related work in privacy-preserving deep learning:

- Focus on ViT architecture: Most prior work has focused on optimizing CNNs like Delphi, SNL, etc. for MPC. This is one of the first works to specifically optimize the ViT architecture which has very different bottlenecks. 

- Heterogeneous attention optimization: The paper proposes mixing different attention modules like ReLU Softmax and Scaling attention in a single ViT using neural architecture search. This provides flexibility compared to methods like MPCFormer that replace Softmax everywhere.

- Joint optimization of attention and MLP: MPCViT+ further optimizes components like GeLU in MLP blocks along with attention, unlike THE-X or MPCFormer that only simplify attention.

- Differential NAS with real latency: The NAS algorithm directly optimizes based on real MPC latency rather than proxy metrics. This is more accurate than prior NAS methods.

- Accuracy improvements: MPCViT achieves higher accuracy along with lower latency compared to MPCFormer and other baselines. The NAS search leads to architectures better optimized for MPC.

- Applicable to vision tasks: Many prior works like THE-X focus on NLP models like BERT. MPCViT shows stronger results on image datasets like Tiny ImageNet compared to applying those techniques.

In summary, MPCViT pushes ViT optimization for MPC further than prior arts by co-designing NAS, developing heterogeneous attention, and jointly optimizing across Transformer components. The results demonstrate clear accuracy and efficiency benefits over existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 According to the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the MPC-aware NAS algorithm for more efficient search. The current differentiable NAS algorithm is simple and effective, but there is room to design more advanced search algorithms tailored for MPC conditions.

- Exploring more flexible heterogeneous attention search spaces. The paper mainly studies three granularities of search space, but other options like row-wise search per head can be investigated. More complex search spaces may lead to better accuracy-latency trade-offs. 

- Applying the ideas to large language models like BERT and GPT. The techniques proposed in this work, including heterogeneous attention and GeLU optimization, can be extended to optimize large NLP models for efficient private inference.

- Co-designing network architecture with MPC protocols. The paper uses existing MPC protocols like Cheetah and SEMI-2K, but custom protocol design paired with model architecture search is an interesting direction.

- Considering computational efficiency along with communication. The current work focuses on reducing communication in MPC, but computation overhead can become non-negligible in some cases and can be jointly optimized.

- Exploring new model components to optimize. Besides attention and MLP, other components like input projection layer, classifier, etc. can also be optimized for private inference efficiency.

- Evaluating optimized models on more MPC frameworks and real-world applications. More experiments on different MPC backends and practical use cases can help validate the robustness and effectiveness.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving the NAS algorithm, expanding the heterogeneous search space, applying to other models like BERT and GPT, co-designing models and protocols, considering computational cost, and more comprehensive evaluation.
