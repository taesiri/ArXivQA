# [Kernelized Normalizing Constant Estimation: Bridging Bayesian Quadrature   and Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05716)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of estimating the normalizing constant (also known as partition function) $\int e^{-\lambda f(\xv)}d\xv$ for functions $f$ belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Here, $\lambda$ is a parameter that controls the difficulty of the estimation. Specifically, when $\lambda\to 0$, the problem becomes similar to Bayesian quadrature (BQ) which estimates integrals. When $\lambda\to\infty$, the problem becomes more similar to Bayesian optimization (BO), which searches for the maximizer. Thus, the problem interpolates between BQ and BO depending on $\lambda$. The paper considers both noiseless and noisy observations and shows how the difficulty varies with $\lambda$ and noise levels.

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides both algorithm-independent lower bounds and practical upper bounds based on a two-phase GP-based algorithm. In the first phase, it constructs a GP surrogate using maximum variance sampling. In the second phase, it samples from the approximated density and computes a multiplicative residual correction. Theoretical analysis is provided for Matérn RKHS functions.

Main Contributions:
- Unifies the problems of BQ and BO under the framework of normalizing constant (NC) estimation, and shows how the problem complexity interpolates between the two based on $\lambda$.

- Provides lower bounds indicating that the problem transitions from being similar to BQ when $\lambda\to 0$ to being similar to BO when $\lambda\to\infty$, for both noiseless and noisy cases.

- Derives upper bounds for a practical two-phase GP algorithm that match the lower bounds in certain regimes, though gaps still exist in other regimes. 

- Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world functions demonstrate superiority over baselines and support the theoretical findings regarding the impact of $\lambda$ and noise levels.

Overall, the paper significantly advances the theoretical understanding on the topic of NC estimation and makes important connections to the established fields of BQ and BO. The analysis also reveals new challenges compared to BQ/BO due to the additional parameter $\lambda$. Both the theoretical and empirical findings provide useful insights on this problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the problem of estimating the normalizing constant (partition function) of a distribution proportional to $e^{-\lambda f(x)}$, where $f$ belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and shows how the difficulty varies between Bayesian quadrature and Bayesian optimization depending on the value of $\lambda$.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper studies the problem of estimating the normalizing constant (or partition function) $\int e^{-\lambda f(\xv)}d\xv$ where $f$ belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with bounded norm, using only zeroth-order (black-box) evaluations of $f$. The main contributions are:

1) It reveals that the difficulty of this estimation problem varies between Bayesian quadrature (BQ) and Bayesian optimization (BO) depending on the value of $\lambda$. When $\lambda\to 0$, the problem behaves like BQ which estimates integrals, whereas when $\lambda\to\infty$, it becomes similar to BO which finds function maxima. 

2) This pattern is shown to hold even in the noisy observation setting, through both algorithm-independent lower bounds and analysis of a proposed two-batch GP-based algorithm. Tight results are obtained in certain regimes.

3) The empirical evaluations on analytic test functions, MLPs and point spread functions verify the theoretical findings. In particular, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform baseline methods especially under small sample budgets.

In summary, this work bridges the gap between BQ and BO by analyzing the intermediate problem of normalizing constant estimation, providing insight into how the nature of the problem changes with the parameter $\lambda$ in both noiseless and noisy settings.

The paper studies the problem of estimating the normalizing constant (also called partition function) of a distribution involving an exponentiated RKHS function, using ideas from Bayesian quadrature and Bayesian optimization. Key aspects include handling noiseless and noisy observations, establishing algorithm-independent lower bounds and practical upper bounds on the estimation error, and analyzing how the difficulty varies between being more similar to Bayesian quadrature versus Bayesian optimization depending on the problem parameters. The analysis relies heavily on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, Gaussian processes, and Matérn kernels. A two-phase sampling algorithm is proposed, combining maximum variance sampling and Langevin Monte Carlo.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-phase algorithm for estimating the normalizing constant. Can you explain in detail the intuition behind using the two phases? What is the purpose of each phase and how do they work together?

2. In the second phase, the paper uses Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) to sample from the distribution proportional to $e^{-\lambda \mu_{T/2}(x)}$. What is the justification behind using this sampling strategy? What are the potential limitations or drawbacks?

3. The analysis of the method leverages several useful lemmas/theorems from Bayesian optimization and Bayesian quadrature literature. Can you summarize 1-2 key results that are adapted and what new analyses need to be carried out to handle the normalizing constant estimation problem?

4. How does the paper handle/analyze the impact of noise in observations? What kinds of noisy regimes are considered and what do the results indicate about the difficulty in those regimes?

5. The paper shows the problem complexity can range between Bayesian quadrature and Bayesian optimization depending on the value of $\lambda$. Can you clearly explain the connections shown, both theoretically and empirically? 

6. What distinguishes the function class and assumptions used in this paper, compared to related work on normalizing constant estimation? How do the theoretical results differ and why?

7. Is the two-phase algorithm with LMC sampling demonstrably optimal, or are there remaining gaps in the analysis? What potential improvements could be made?

8. The empirical evaluation relies on several baselines and benchmark functions. What is the rationale behind the specific choices and what do the experiments reveal about the proposed approach?

9. How does the difficulty of estimating the normalizing constant change with the dimensionality $d$ of the problem based on the results? Does the dependence match intuitions?

10. The paper studies how the quantity $\lambda$, which temporally scales the function, impacts difficulty. Are there any other problem parameters that would be worth further theoretical or empirical analysis?
