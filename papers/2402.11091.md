## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Guiding large groups of autonomous robots (very large-scale robotic (VLSR) systems) through complex, cluttered environments is challenging due to scalability issues with optimal path planning. 
- Commonly used Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to represent the robots' spatial distributions have limitations in cluttered environments with many small-scale obstacles.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel statistical model called the skew-normal mixture model (SNMM) to better represent robot distributions against complex environments.
- The SNMM consists of multivariate skew-normal distribution components. These interact with obstacle occupancy information to provide more flexibility and environmental adaptability than GMMs.
- Present a parameter learning algorithm to estimate SNMM parameters from sample robot positions.
- Develop two SNMM-based path planning algorithms to guide robots through cluttered environments by optimizing a potential function:
   - SNMM-DI: Uses displacement interpolation between start and goal distributions.
   - SNMM-APF: Directly optimizes artificial potential field using SNMM-based distributions.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel multivariate skew-normal distribution and SNMM formulation incorporating environmental interactions to represent robot teams.
- SNMM parameter learning algorithm for estimation from sample data.
- Demonstrated superior performance of SNMM-based path planning versus GMM-based alternative in complex simulation environments, especially in highly cluttered spaces.

In summary, the paper proposes a new SNMM model for representing robot teams and associated learning and path planning algorithms. Simulations showcase the SNMM's advantages for guiding large robot groups through cluttered environments versus traditional GMM approaches.
