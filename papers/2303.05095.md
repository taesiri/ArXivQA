# [Trajectory-Aware Body Interaction Transformer for Multi-Person Pose   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05095)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively forecast multi-person poses in complex crowd scenarios by modeling fine-grained human body interaction. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called TBIFormer to capture complex interaction dependencies among individuals based on skeletal body parts. The key hypotheses are:

1) Transforming the pose sequence into a Multi-Person Body-Part (MPBP) sequence can help retain both spatial and temporal information to learn body part dynamics. 

2) The proposed Social Body Interaction Multi-Head Self-Attention (SBI-MSA) module can effectively model body part interactions across inter- and intra-individuals by capturing motion similarities of body parts.

3) The Trajectory-Aware Relative Position Encoding introduced in SBI-MSA provides additional interactive clues and more discriminative spatial information compared to euclidean distance-based encodings.

4) Modeling body part dynamics and interaction can lead to more accurate multi-person pose forecasting compared to existing methods that overlook body part relationships.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling body part interactions both within and between individuals can improve multi-person pose forecasting in complex scenarios, which TBIFormer aims to validate through its technical designs and experiments.
