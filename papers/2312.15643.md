# [Abductive Logical Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15643)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on the task of abductive logical reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs). 
- Abductive reasoning involves making educated guesses to infer the most likely reasons that can explain observed phenomena or facts.  
- Applying abductive reasoning over KGs is useful but underexplored. It is challenging due to:
  (1) Incompleteness of KGs
  (2) Complexity of logical hypotheses needing to be generated to explain observations on KGs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel generation-based approach to conduct abductive reasoning on KGs. 
- It first samples observation-hypothesis pairs from a KG and trains a transformer-based generative model using teacher forcing. This model generates logical hypothesis given an observation set.
- To further improve the model, an RL-based method called Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Graph (RLF-KG) is introduced. RLF-KG uses the proximity between the observation set and the conclusion derived from a generated hypothesis on the KG as reward. It minimizes their differences.
- RLF-KG helps optimize the hypothesis generation towards providing better explanations for observations using feedback signals from the KG structure.

Main Contributions:
- Formally defines the novel problem of abductive logical reasoning on knowledge graphs.
- Proposes a generation-based approach using neural models to address complexity challenges compared to symbolic search-based methods.
- Introduces the RLF-KG method to optimize hypothesis generation using graph feedback.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of the proposed techniques on three benchmark KGs - FB15k-237, WN18RR and DBpedia50.

In summary, the paper explores the important but understudied problem of abduction on KGs. It presents innovative deep learning solutions to address key challenges in this task. The proposed RLF-KG technique helps further boost performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach over competitive baselines.
