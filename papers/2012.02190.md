# [pixelNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from One or Few Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02190)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes pixelNeRF, a method for learning to predict neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from one or a few input images. The key research questions are:1. Can a neural network learn a strong enough scene prior from a dataset of images to infer reasonable novel views from sparse inputs (as few as one image)?2. Can image features be effectively incorporated into the NeRF framework in a way that allows training from multi-view images alone, without any explicit 3D supervision? The authors hypothesize that by conditioning the NeRF MLP on local image features in a fully convolutional manner, the network can learn useful scene priors from multi-view datasets. This would allow generating reasonable novel views of a scene in a feedforward manner from very sparse inputs, without needing to optimize a NeRF from scratch for each new scene like the original NeRF method.The key contributions and hypotheses tested are:- A fully convolutional image encoder that extracts aligned spatial features from input views. These features provide localization cues that guide novel view synthesis.- A modified NeRF network that incorporates these image features via residuals in each layer. This conditions scene density/color prediction on input views.- Demonstrating that this architecture can be trained on multi-view images to learn useful scene priors for applications like single-image novel view synthesis.- Showing that the model works for variable numbers of input views at test time, unlike previous methods.- Evaluating on diverse synthetic and real datasets to test generalization capabilities, from multiple object ShapeNet scenes to challenging real DTU data.In summary, the main hypotheses are around learning implicit 3D scene representations more efficiently from sparse image inputs, by incorporating spatial image features into the NeRF formulation in a way that facilitates learning broadly useful scene priors.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes pixelNeRF, a learning framework to predict a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on one or few input images. - This is aimed at addressing limitations of the original NeRF method, which requires optimizing a neural radiance field representation independently for each scene using many calibrated views. The key limitations are the need for lots of input views and compute time per scene. - PixelNeRF incorporates image features in a fully convolutional manner to enable training a single model on a dataset of scenes. This allows it to learn a scene prior and perform novel view synthesis from sparse views without needing optimization at test time.- The method encodes input images into a pixel-aligned feature volume. For each query 3D point, it samples the corresponding image feature and passes this into the NeRF network along with the 3D point and view direction. - It can handle an arbitrary number of input views at test time and is flexible to unseen scenes, objects, and categories by operating in view space rather than a canonical space.- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet for few-shot view synthesis, including on unseen categories and multi-object scenes. It also shows promising results on real images from the DTU dataset.In summary, the key hypothesis is that conditioning NeRF on image features will enable training across scenes to learn useful priors and generate novel views from very sparse inputs, overcoming limitations of the original NeRF method. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel method called pixelNeRF for synthesizing novel views of a 3D scene from sparse input views. Here is a summary of how it relates to other research on novel view synthesis and neural scene representations:- It builds on neural radiance fields (NeRF) which represent a scene as a continuous volumetric radiance field using a neural network. NeRF achieves impressive view synthesis results but requires optimizing a model to each new scene, which is slow and requires many input views. PixelNeRF addresses this by learning a neural scene prior from data.- Most view synthesis methods like DeepStereo, Free View Synthesis, and Single-Image Novel View Synthesis use image-based rendering techniques and 2.5D scene representations. They are limited in the range of views they can synthesize. PixelNeRF infers a full 3D NeRF representation to enable larger viewpoint changes.- Other neural 3D representations like ONet, DVR, and SRN can also learn 3D scene priors from data. But they often compress the input into a single global feature vector which loses detailed image information. PixelNeRF uses an fully convolutional encoder to preserve spatial alignment to image features.- Many 3D reconstruction methods like Occupancy Networks, DVR, and SRN predict scene representations in a canonical object-centered space. PixelNeRF represents scenes in view space which helps it generalize to novel scenes and categories.- Unlike SRN which requires known camera poses at test time, pixelNeRF is fully feed-forward using only relative camera poses. It also naturally handles an arbitrary number of input views.So in summary, pixelNeRF contributes a way to predict full 3D NeRF scene representations from sparse inputs in a feed-forward way, while preserving detailed spatial image information. The view-space formulation and convolutional image encoder help it generalize across objects and scenes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents pixelNeRF, a method for predicting neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from one or a few input images. Here is a summary of how it relates to other work on novel view synthesis and neural scene representations:- Compared to the original NeRF, pixelNeRF learns a scene prior from data rather than optimizing a separate NeRF for each scene. This allows it to synthesize novel views from sparse inputs without needing per-scene optimization like NeRF.- Other novel view synthesis methods like DeepStereo, Free View Synthesis, and Single View View Synthesis use image-based rendering techniques to extrapolate views from one or a few images. However, they rely on 2.5D scene representations which limits their viewpoint flexibility compared to pixelNeRF's full 3D representation.- Neural Volumes and Neural Sparse Voxel Fields also learn neural scene representations from data, but require 3D supervision. PixelNeRF is trained only from 2D images.- DeepVoxels and Occupancy Networks learn 3D shape priors but use global features and canonical object frames which limits detail. PixelNeRF uses local image features aligned to the input views.  - SRN can be trained with multi-view supervision like pixelNeRF but requires known camera poses and per-scene optimization at test time. PixelNeRF is fully feed-forward.- Concurrent work GRF also conditions NeRF on images but operates in canonical space and has limited multi-view results. PixelNeRF uses view space and handles arbitrary numbers of inputs.So in summary, pixelNeRF uniquely combines the NeRF representation with an image conditioned architecture that retains view information. This allows learning a scene prior for novel view synthesis from minimal inputs, with advantages over both classic NeRF and other learning based view synthesis techniques. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors in the paper suggest several potential directions for future research, including:- Improving efficiency of NeRF-based methods: The rendering time of NeRF is slow, increasing linearly with more input views. Further work could focus on making NeRF more efficient and real-time.- Making NeRF scale-invariant: Currently, ray sampling bounds and the scale of positional encodings need to be manually tuned. Methods to make NeRF scale invariant would be useful. - Applying to in-the-wild scenes: The experiments were limited to controlled datasets like ShapeNet and DTU. Applying NeRF-based methods to large-scale in-the-wild images with greater pose variation remains an open challenge.- Recovering explicit surfaces: Unlike some other methods, NeRF does not produce an explicit surface representation, making tasks like mesh extraction difficult. Combining NeRF with more traditional representations is an area for research.- Handling scenes with varying lighting: Modeling scenes with complex non-Lambertian effects remains difficult for NeRF. Improving lighting modeling would extend applicability.- Extending to video: Applying NeRF-based models to novel view synthesis in video settings could be impactful.In summary, the key future directions are improving efficiency, applicability to real unconstrained images, integration with more explicit 3D representations, and modeling complex effects like lighting and dynamics over time. Advances in these areas could greatly increase the practical utility of NeRF-based novel view synthesis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:- Improving the efficiency of NeRF-based methods to enable real-time rendering and manipulation. The authors note that the rendering time of NeRF is slow and cannot be easily converted to meshes. Making NeRF more efficient could enable more interactive applications.- Developing scale-invariant NeRF methods. Currently, hyperparameters like the depth sampling bounds need to be manually tuned per scene. Developing NeRF variants that can adapt to scenes of different scales would make the framework more generally applicable. - Learning priors and representations for 360 degree in-the-wild scenes. The experiments in this work are limited to datasets like ShapeNet and DTU with controlled capturing. Scaling up to large real world datasets with diverse viewpoints remains an exciting direction.- Incorporating symmetry and shape completion. The authors note pixelNeRF does not leverage object symmetry as well as canonical space methods. Improving shape completion, especially for unseen regions, could further boost novel view synthesis performance.- Reducing the number of required views. While pixelNeRF improves over NeRF's view requirements, reconstructing high quality novel views from even fewer input views (ideally one) remains an open problem.In summary, the main future directions are around improving efficiency, generalization, and reconstructing even more complex real scenes from fewer images. Developing the core NeRF representation and extending its applicability are central challenges identified by the authors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes pixelNeRF, a learning framework to predict continuous neural radiance fields (NeRFs) conditioned on one or few input images. NeRF represents a scene using a neural network that outputs volume density and color, enabling novel view synthesis via volume rendering. However, NeRF requires optimizing a model per scene using many images. To address this, pixelNeRF incorporates fully convolutional image features into the NeRF network, allowing it to be trained on datasets to learn scene priors and generate novel views from sparse inputs without test-time optimization. Experiments on ShapeNet and real data demonstrate pixelNeRF's effectiveness, outperforming baselines in novel view synthesis from one or few images. Key aspects are the fully convolutional image encoder, operating in view rather than canonical space, and incorporating view directions to weigh image features. This confers greater generalization and applicability to unseen scenes and categories. The flexible framework is shown to handle multi-object scenes and real data without modification. Overall, pixelNeRF makes progress towards fast feed-forward reconstruction of neural radiance fields from limited image data.
