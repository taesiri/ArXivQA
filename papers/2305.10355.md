# Evaluating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It provides the first systematic study evaluating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs). The paper examines several representative LVLMs on the MSCOCO dataset using the CHAIR metric and finds they suffer from severe object hallucination issues. 2. It analyzes potential factors leading to object hallucination in LVLMs, revealing objects frequently occurring in visual instructions or co-occurring with image objects are more prone to be hallucinated. Over 40% of hallucinated objects are among the top 10 most frequent in instruction corpora.3. It proposes an improved evaluation method called POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation) to assess object hallucination in a more stable and flexible way. POPE converts the evaluation to Yes/No questions about object existence. Experiments show POPE yields consistent results as CHAIR and also reflects LVLMs' tendency to answer "Yes".4. When combined with automatic segmentation tools, POPE can evaluate object hallucination on datasets without annotations. Experiments on MSCOCO, A-OKVQA, and GQA validate the effectiveness of annotation-free POPE.In summary, the paper provides the first comprehensive study of object hallucination in LVLMs, reveals its severity and potential causes, and proposes a more reliable evaluation approach in POPE. The findings highlight object hallucination as an important issue to address when developing LVLMs.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How serious is the object hallucination problem in large vision-language models (LVLMs), what factors contribute to this issue, and how can it be evaluated in a more robust way?Specifically, the key points are:- The paper conducts an empirical study to evaluate the object hallucination problem in several representative LVLMs using existing metrics. The results show that LVLMs suffer severe object hallucination issues, even more than smaller vision-language models. - The paper investigates potential factors leading to object hallucination in LVLMs, and reveals that objects frequently occurring in visual instructions or co-occurring with image objects are more prone to be hallucinated.- The paper proposes an improved evaluation method called POPE that converts hallucination evaluation to a set of binary classification tasks, which is shown to be more stable and flexible for assessing object hallucination in LVLMs.In summary, the central hypothesis is that object hallucination is a serious issue in LVLMs, and the key contribution is providing empirical analysis of this problem and devising an improved evaluation approach. The overall goal is to bring attention to this issue and promote more reliable LVLMs.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is my summary of how this paper compares to other research on evaluating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs):- This appears to be the first work providing a systematic study and evaluation of object hallucination specifically in LVLMs. Previous work has studied hallucination issues in large language models and vision-language models separately, but this paper offers the first targeted analysis for LVLMs.- The paper provides an empirical analysis of several state-of-the-art LVLMs on the MSCOCO dataset using the CHAIR metric, finding that they suffer from high levels of object hallucination compared to smaller baseline VLPMs. This demonstrates the severity of the issue in modern LVLMs.- The analysis investigates potential factors contributing to hallucination in LVLMs, including the object frequency and co-occurrence patterns in the visual instruction datasets used for training. The paper offers both qualitative and quantitative evidence that these factors correlate with higher hallucination rates.- The authors propose a new evaluation method called POPE that probes LVLMs with targeted yes/no questions about potential objects. This converts hallucination assessment into a binary classification task. Experiments show POPE provides more stable results across prompt variations compared to existing methods.- POPE offers different sampling strategies for probing objects - random, frequent, and adversarial based on co-occurrence. Analysis using POPE further confirms the tendencies identified to hallucinate frequent or co-occurring objects.- The paper demonstrates POPE can be applied to unannotated datasets by using an automatic segmentation model, improving the flexibility of the evaluation approach.In summary, this paper provides the most comprehensive analysis of object hallucination in LVLMs to date, offers insights into potential causes, and introduces a new targeted evaluation methodology in POPE that improves over existing practices. The analysis and proposed techniques help advance understanding and assessment of this important issue.
