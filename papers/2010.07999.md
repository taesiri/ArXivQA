# [What is More Likely to Happen Next? Video-and-Language Future Event   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07999)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can AI models learn to make multimodal commonsense predictions about future events given a video clip (with dialogue), by choosing the more likely event between two possible future events?

To address this question, the paper introduces a new dataset and task called Video-and-Language Event Prediction (VLEP) for predicting future events from videos. The key aspects are:

- The task requires predicting fine-grained future events from short video clips with aligned dialogue. This requires understanding both visual and language semantics as well as commonsense knowledge.

- The VLEP dataset contains 28,726 examples collected from diverse videos to support this task. The examples consist of a premise video/dialogue, two possible future events, and human rationales.

- The dataset uses adversarial data collection and matching to reduce biases and trivial examples. Analysis shows this helps increase the dataset difficulty.

- They present a transformer-based multimodal baseline model incorporating video, text and commonsense knowledge. Experiments demonstrate the usefulness of each modality.

- There is a large gap between model (67.46%) and human performance (90.50%) indicating this is a challenging task with room for improvement.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that models can learn to make non-trivial, multimodal, commonsense future event predictions on this new dataset, which requires joint understanding across video, language and commonsense reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new task called Video-and-Language Event Prediction, which requires predicting which of two possible future events is more likely to happen after observing a video clip with aligned dialogue. This task requires both video and language understanding as well as commonsense reasoning.

2. Introducing a new dataset called VLEP for this task, containing 28,726 examples built from TV show and YouTube lifestyle vlog clips. The dataset uses adversarial data collection and adversarial matching to reduce biases and ensure a balanced set of easy and difficult examples.

3. Presenting a strong transformer-based baseline model that encodes the video, dialogue, and candidate future events, incorporates commonsense knowledge, and makes a prediction. Experiments show each component contributes positively, though there is still a large gap compared to human performance.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and benchmarking a new multimodal prediction task that requires deeper video and language understanding and commonsense reasoning than prior work in this area. The new dataset and strong baseline model provide a foundation for future research on this challenging task.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things about how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes a new multimodal prediction task and dataset called Video-and-Language Event Prediction (VLEP). This is novel compared to prior work on video-and-language understanding, which has focused more on tasks like video captioning, QA, and retrieval. The future event prediction task requires deeper understanding and reasoning.

- Existing video forecasting work has looked mainly at predicting low-level future frames, motions, or actions from videos. This paper focuses on predicting high-level natural language future events, which is more complex and semantic. 

- For data collection, the paper uses strategies like adversarial human annotation and adversarial matching to reduce bias and trivial examples. Many prior video+text datasets suffer from annotation artifacts, so these collection methods help improve dataset quality.

- The paper incorporates commonsense knowledge, which is shown to improve results. This aligns with recent interests in integrating external knowledge into vision-language models, in contrast to earlier works that relied only on dataset supervision.

- The task, dataset, and model in this paper cover multimodal, temporal, and commonsense reasoning aspects. Many prior works have focused on one or two of those but not all three.

- The work provides a strong baseline but there is still a large gap compared to human performance. This suggests the task remains very challenging and open for future research to make additional progress.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel and multifaceted video+text prediction task compared to prior work, and introduces innovations in data collection, knowledge integration, and modeling that advance research in this area. But there is still much room for improvement on this challenging task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Better video and dialogue understanding models: The authors show that their oracle model which has access to the premise summary performs significantly better, indicating the need for better video and dialogue understanding models.

- Incorporating more sophisticated commonsense reasoning: The ablation study shows that incorporating commonsense knowledge from ATOMIC helps, but there is scope for integrating more advanced and diverse commonsense reasoning abilities.

- Exploring different model architectures: The transformer-based model serves as a strong baseline, but the authors suggest exploring other model architectures could lead to further improvements.

- Reducing the gap between model and human performance: There is a large gap between model performance (67.46%) and human performance (90.50%) indicating significant room for progress.

- Mitigating biases and artifacts in datasets: The authors propose strategies like adversarial data collection and matching to reduce biases, but more work can be done along these lines.

- Setting up alternative evaluation protocols: The authors suggest using human evaluations for a generation setup of the task could be an interesting alternative to the multiple choice benchmark.

- Creating datasets in other domains/languages: The current dataset focuses on English TV shows and YouTube videos. Expanding to other domains and languages is noted as a direction.

In summary, the key suggestions are around improving video/dialogue understanding, reasoning abilities, model architectures, reducing dataset biases, closing the human-model gap, and extending the dataset/task to new settings. The proposed task poses many open challenges for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset and task called Video-and-Language Event Prediction (VLEP) for predicting likely future events from videos and aligned dialogue. The VLEP dataset contains 28,726 examples from 10,234 short video clips extracted from TV shows and YouTube lifestyle vlogs. Each example consists of a premise event (video + dialogue), a text summary, and two possible future event descriptions, one more likely than the other. To mitigate biases, the dataset is constructed using standard data collection, adversarial data collection with models in the loop, and adversarial matching between premises. The paper also presents a transformer-based baseline model that encodes the video, dialogue, and candidate future events, and incorporates commonsense knowledge from ATOMIC. Experiments show the importance of all information sources, with room for improvement compared to human performance. The new VLEP dataset and future event prediction task pose challenges for multimodal understanding and commonsense reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new task called Video-and-Language Event Prediction, which requires predicting which of two possible future events is more likely to occur after seeing a video clip with dialogue. To support this task, the authors collected a new dataset called VLEP with over 28,000 examples extracted from TV shows and YouTube lifestyle vlogs. 

The examples consist of short video clips paired with dialogue subtitles, text summaries, and two possible future event descriptions. To reduce biases and trivial examples, the dataset was collected using adversarial methods to encourage crowdworkers to provide challenging negatives. The authors present a transformer-based model incorporating video, text, and commonsense knowledge as a baseline. Experiments show each modality improves performance, but there is still a large gap compared to human accuracy, indicating this is a challenging task for future research. Overall, this paper introduces an interesting and difficult new task combining video, language, and commonsense understanding to predict likely future events.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset and task called Video-and-Language Event Prediction (VLEP), where the goal is to predict which of two possible future events is more likely to occur after watching a short video clip with aligned dialogue. To create the dataset, the authors collect short 6-second video clips from TV shows and YouTube lifestyle vlogs. Crowdworkers write natural language descriptions of a premise event in the clip, two possible future events, and rationales. To reduce biases and simple negatives, the dataset is constructed via standard data collection, adversarial data collection where crowdworkers try to fool a model, and adversarial matching where positive events are sampled as negatives for other premises. The authors propose a transformer-based model as a baseline, which encodes the video frames, dialogue, and future event text separately using pretrained models. These representations are fused via a multimodal transformer encoder. Commonsense knowledge is incorporated by fine-tuning the text encoder on relevant inferences from the ATOMIC dataset. The model is trained to classify which future event is more likely through a softmax layer. Experiments analyze the contribution of each modality and knowledge source.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem/question it is addressing is:

How to develop AI models that can make plausible predictions about future events based on observing a short video clip and associated dialogue. Specifically, given a video with aligned dialogue (the "premise event"), and two possible future event descriptions, the aim is to predict which future event is more likely to happen next.

The key challenges involved are:

- Understanding the rich dynamics in the video and dialogue to pick up on relevant cues about what could happen next.

- Leveraging commonsense world knowledge and reasoning beyond just the basic semantics in the video and dialogue. For example, understanding typical human motivations, reactions, social norms, etc. that shape how events unfold.

- Avoiding biases and annotation artifacts that could allow models to make predictions based on superficial patterns rather than genuine video and dialogue comprehension.

To study this problem, the paper introduces a new dataset called the Video-and-Language Event Prediction (VLEP) dataset, containing short video clips paired with possible future event descriptions. It also presents analysis of the dataset and benchmarks using a multimodal transformer model incorporating video, dialogue and commonsense understanding.

The overall goal is to explore how well current AI models can perform fine-grained, multimodal future event prediction compared to humans, while creating resources to support further research in this direction. The results indicate there is still a large gap compared to human performance, highlighting the challenge of this task.

7. Dialogue is encoded via pretrained RoBERTa. Would finetuning RoBERTa on dialogue data help? What other dialogue encoding strategies can be explored? 

8. The model uses a simple concatenation to combine video, dialogue and event embeddings. What are more advanced fusion techniques that can model interactions better?

9. What auxiliary losses could be added during training to enforce better video and language understanding? How can the model be analyzed to identify weaknesses in modality understanding?
