# [Breaking the Curse of Multilinguality with Cross-lingual Expert Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multilingual language models like XGLM are trained on text from 100+ languages. However, there is competition between languages for the model's limited capacity. This leads to degraded performance on individual languages compared to monolingual models. This is called the "curse of multilinguality".

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Cross-lingual Expert Language Models (X-ELM). These are sets of smaller expert models, each trained on a subset of languages.
- X-ELMs are created using a training procedure called x-BTM:
   1) Initialize experts from a pretrained multilingual model
   2) Allocate data to experts (by language similarity or TF-IDF clustering) 
   3) Train experts independently on different data clusters
   4) Merge experts into an ensemble
- X-ELMs can be improved via Hierarchical Multi-Round training. New experts are branched from existing ones and trained on sub-groups of languages.

Main Contributions:
- X-ELMs outperform jointly trained models given the same compute budget. They achieve lower perplexity on all 16 evaluation languages.
- X-ELMs provide more balanced improvements across languages compared to dense models.
- New languages can be added via Hierarchical Multi-Round training without hurting existing expert performance.
- X-ELMs are more computationally efficient to train than dense models since experts are trained independently.
- Experiments show X-ELM perplexity gains transfer to better performance on downstream tasks through in-context learning.

In summary, the paper presents X-ELMs to mitigate the curse of multilinguality. Sets of expert models are shown to better leverage model capacity leading to gains over dense multilingual baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Cross-lingual Expert Language Models (X-ELM), which are sets of smaller expert language models independently trained on partitions of a multilingual corpus, as a way to mitigate the curse of multilinguality that arises in dense multilingual language model training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing Cross-lingual Expert Language Models (x-ELMs) to mitigate the "curse of multilinguality" in multilingual language models. Specifically:

- They extend the Branch-Train-Merge (BTM) algorithm for training sparse expert models to the multilingual setting (x-BTM). This involves clustering the multilingual data based on linguistic typology or TF-IDF and training separate expert LMs on each cluster.

- They propose a method called Hierarchical Multi-Round (HMR) training to efficiently adapt x-ELMs to new languages without catastrophic forgetting of existing ones. 

- They demonstrate through experiments that x-ELMs outperform dense multilingual LMs of the same parameter count across a variety of languages and tasks. The gains are especially pronounced for lower-resource languages.

- x-ELMs provide additional benefits like more efficient training and inference, ability to iteratively add new languages without forgetting existing ones, and reduced hardware requirements compared to dense multilingual LMs.

In summary, the key innovation is using expert LMs and sparse training techniques to address performance disparities between languages in multilingual models. x-ELMs alleviate the curse of multilinguality while retaining benefits of cross-lingual transfer.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Cross-lingual Expert Language Models (x-ELM) - The main model architecture proposed, which is an ensemble of independently trained language models that specialize on different languages.

- Branch-Train-Merge (BTM) - The training paradigm that x-ELM builds on, where models are branched from a shared initialization, trained separately, and then merged. 

- x-BTM - The extension of BTM proposed for the multilingual setting, which incorporates typological clustering.

- Hierarchical Multi-Round (HMR) training - A proposed training procedure that leverages the typological hierarchy to iteratively train more specialized expert models. 

- Curse of multilinguality - The phenomenon where modeling many languages in a single model degrades performance on individual languages due to competition for model capacity. A key motivation for x-ELM is mitigating this effect.

- Language adaptive pretraining (LAPT) - Continued pretraining on new target languages, which is shown to be more effective within the x-ELM framework.

- Catastrophic forgetting - The problem where adapting models to new data/tasks significantly harms performance on previous data/tasks. x-ELM avoids this issue.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does typological clustering of languages compare to standard TF-IDF clustering for sparse training of multilingual language models? What are the trade-offs between these methods?

2. What are the key differences between the hierarchical multi-round (HMR) training procedure proposed in this work versus standard branch-train-merge (BTM) methods? What advantages does HMR provide? 

3. How does the cross-lingual expert language model (X-ELM) approach help mitigate the "curse of multilinguality" compared to jointly trained dense models? What is the explanation for why it helps?

4. What are the practical benefits of asynchronous training of experts in the X-ELM framework? How does it help democratize multilingual modeling?

5. What methods for inference with the set of X-ELM experts are proposed? How do they compare in terms of accuracy versus computational efficiency? 

6. Why is hierarchical multi-round training particularly beneficial for adapting X-ELM models to new unseen languages? How does it save compute compared to other methods?

7. How prone are individual X-ELM experts to "catastrophic forgetting" of languages they are not specialized in? What factors affect the likelihood of forgetting for a language?

8. Why does the X-ELM approach not seem to disproportionally benefit higher-resourced languages compared to lower-resourced ones? What explanations are provided?

9. How do the X-ELM models perform on downstream tasks compared to baselines when evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings? Is there evidence the LM gains transfer?

10. What are some limitations of the experimental setup used to evaluate X-ELM models in this work? What additional experiments would be useful to conduct in future work?
