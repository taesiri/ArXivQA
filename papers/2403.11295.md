# [Order-One Rolling Shutter Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rolling shutter (RS) cameras dominate consumer and smartphone markets but produce distorted images compared to global shutter cameras. New computer vision algorithms must be developed specifically for RS cameras. 
- Previous work has developed some methods for absolute RS camera pose estimation but the relative pose problem is not fully solved. 
- The paper studies "order-one" RS cameras, which see generic 3D points exactly once. This class generalizes perspective cameras and includes many practical RS cameras.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

- Introduces a new back-projection model to represent RS camera rays and rolling planes (Sec 2).
- Characterizes order-one RS (RS1) cameras - their rolling planes intersect in a line K; their "picture taking" map is rational (Sec 3).  
- Constructs explicit parameterizations of RS1 cameras moving along lines, conics, etc (Sec 4).
- Shows the image of a line under RS1 cameras is a rational curve passing through a special point (Sec 5).
- Discovers 31 new minimal problems for 2-5 linear RS1 cameras by exploiting properties of line images (Sec 6). Several problems have small degree suitable for practical reconstruction.
- Explains how the efficient Straight-Cayley RS model leads to many order-one cameras suitable for applications (Sec 7).

In summary, the paper develops a unified theory of order-one RS cameras, provides explicit parameterizations for them, determines constraints on their image curves, and discovers new small minimal problems for efficient RS1 multi-view reconstruction. The theory also explains why existing Straight-Cayley model works well in practice.
