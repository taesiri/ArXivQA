# [Sabiá-2: A New Generation of Portuguese Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for large language models specialized in Portuguese that can perform well on tasks relevant to Brazilian culture and academia. General purpose models like GPT-3 often fall short in specialized domains.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces Sabiá-2, a family of large language models trained specifically on Portuguese text. Three models of varying sizes are evaluated: Sabiá-2 Small, Medium and Large.

- The models are evaluated on diverse Brazilian benchmarks including academic entrance exams like ENEM, professional certification exams like OAB, and a new multi-turn conversation benchmark called BRACEval tailored to Brazilian culture.

Key Contributions:

- Sabiá-2 Medium matches or exceeds GPT-4 performance in 23 out 64 exam benchmarks and outperforms GPT-3.5 in 58 out of 64. This demonstrates the value of specialization without increasing model size.

- Sabiá-2 Medium is 10 times cheaper per token than GPT-4. The smaller Sabiá-2 Small also outperforms models like GPT-3.5 showing cost-effectiveness.

- Analysis reveals strengths in law, medicine, engineering but weaknesses in mathematical reasoning.

- New Brazilian conversation benchmark BRACEval is introduced covering abilities like role play, reasoning and knowledge of Brazilian culture.

In summary, the paper presents Sabiá-2, a family of Portuguese models that demonstrates specialized performance in Brazilian domains, outperforming general models like GPT-3.5. Key strengths and limitations are highlighted as avenues for future work.
