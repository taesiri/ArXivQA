# [The Problem of Coherence in Natural Language Explanations of   Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable recommendation systems aim to provide natural language explanations to justify predicted ratings and recommendations. However, an important aspect of explanation quality has been overlooked - the coherence between the generated text and the predicted rating.
- Lack of coherence undermines the usefulness of the explanation and trust in the system. But current evaluation metrics don't directly measure coherence.  
- A manual analysis revealed that even in standard datasets, 25-30% of reference explanations are not coherent with ratings.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new trainable, reference-less metric to automatically evaluate coherence between predictions and explanations without needing manual verification. Converts rating+text into an input sentence for a classifier.
- Propose a new transformer-based method called Coherent Explainable Recommender (CER) that adds a module and intermediary task of explanation-based rating estimation. 
- This additional prediction head takes only the text as input and predicts rating, providing a training signal to generate more coherent explanations.

Contributions:
- Draw attention to overlooked problem of lack of prediction-explanation coherence
- Manual evaluation revealing issues even in standard datasets 
- New automatic coherence evaluation metric
- CER method with explanation-based rating estimation intermediary task
- Experiments show CER improves coherence without hurting recommendation performance

In summary, the paper clearly identifies the important but overlooked issue of coherence in explainable recommendations. Both through analysis of existing methods and by proposing a new trainable evaluation metric and CER method with built-in coherence mechanism, the paper makes valuable contributions towards generating more useful, trustworthy explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new transformer-based method for explainable recommendation that improves the coherence between generated natural language explanations and predicted ratings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Drawing attention to the critical but overlooked problem of lack of coherence between generated natural language explanations and predicted ratings in explainable recommendation systems. The paper shows through manual evaluation that even reference explanations in commonly used datasets have significant incoherence.

2. Proposing a new automatic, trainable metric for evaluating the coherence between explanations and predictions without needing manual annotations.

3. Introducing a new transformer-based explainable recommendation method called Coherent Explainable Recommender (CER) which adds an intermediary task of explanation-based rating prediction. This provides an additional training signal to generate more coherent explanations.

4. Experimental evaluation on three benchmark datasets demonstrating that CER generates significantly more coherent explanations than state-of-the-art methods like PETER+, without negatively affecting other metrics like recommendation quality or text fluency.

In summary, the key contribution is highlighting the important but understudied problem of coherence in explainable recommendations, proposing methods for evaluating it automatically, and introducing a new technique to improve coherence specifically.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Explainable recommendation systems
- Coherence between explanation and prediction
- Natural language explanation generation
- Transformer models
- Intermediary tasks for improving coherence
- Automatic coherence evaluation metrics
- Benchmark datasets for explainable recommendation

The paper focuses on improving the coherence between the predicted ratings and generated natural language explanations in explainable recommendation systems. It proposes a new transformer-based method called Coherent Explainable Recommender (CER) that uses an intermediary task of explanation-based rating prediction to improve coherence. The paper also introduces new automatic metrics to evaluate explanation-prediction coherence and analyzes benchmark datasets, finding issues with incoherence even in the reference explanations. Overall, the key ideas revolve around ensuring and evaluating the coherence of explanations with predictions in explainable recommenders.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new intermediary task called "explanation-based rating estimation." Can you explain in more detail how this task works and why it helps improve the coherence between the predicted rating and generated explanation? 

2. The proposed Coherent Explainable Recommender (CER) model builds upon the PETER+ architecture. What modifications were made to the PETER+ model to incorporate the new explanation-based rating estimation task?

3. The paper argues that currently used evaluation metrics for explainable recommendation systems overlook the critical issue of coherence between the predicted rating and explanation. Can you elaborate on why existing metrics fail to capture this aspect and how the proposed trainable coherence metric addresses this gap?  

4. What were some of the key challenges in designing an automatic, trainable metric to evaluate the coherence between numerical rating predictions and textual explanations? How does the proposed metric handle these challenges?

5. The experimental results demonstrate that CER generates more coherent explanations than PETER+ without negatively affecting metrics like recommendation quality and text fluency. What mechanisms allow CER to improve coherence while maintaining performance on other metrics?  

6. While CER improves coherence for some datasets, the results are mixed for the TripAdvisor dataset. What factors could explain why coherence gains were less clear for this dataset?  

7. The paper points out noise and inconsistency issues with the manually constructed explanations in widely used benchmark datasets. In your view, what best practices should be adopted when constructing gold standard explanation datasets to mitigate these issues going forward?

8. The proposed coherence metric relies on a transformer-based language model. How sensitive are the reported results to the choice of language model, and could further gains be achieved by using more advanced models? 

9. The paper focuses specifically on the coherence between rating predictions and generated texts. What other aspects of explanation quality merit further research attention? Are there other underexplored issues with current evaluation practices?  

10. The CER model incorporates multiple supervised prediction tasks like rating prediction, explanation generation, etc. Could the inclusion of weakly supervised or self-supervised objectives provide further benefits for improving explanation coherence?
