# [The Problem of Coherence in Natural Language Explanations of   Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable recommendation systems aim to provide natural language explanations to justify predicted ratings and recommendations. However, an important aspect of explanation quality has been overlooked - the coherence between the generated text and the predicted rating.
- Lack of coherence undermines the usefulness of the explanation and trust in the system. But current evaluation metrics don't directly measure coherence.  
- A manual analysis revealed that even in standard datasets, 25-30% of reference explanations are not coherent with ratings.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new trainable, reference-less metric to automatically evaluate coherence between predictions and explanations without needing manual verification. Converts rating+text into an input sentence for a classifier.
- Propose a new transformer-based method called Coherent Explainable Recommender (CER) that adds a module and intermediary task of explanation-based rating estimation. 
- This additional prediction head takes only the text as input and predicts rating, providing a training signal to generate more coherent explanations.

Contributions:
- Draw attention to overlooked problem of lack of prediction-explanation coherence
- Manual evaluation revealing issues even in standard datasets 
- New automatic coherence evaluation metric
- CER method with explanation-based rating estimation intermediary task
- Experiments show CER improves coherence without hurting recommendation performance

In summary, the paper clearly identifies the important but overlooked issue of coherence in explainable recommendations. Both through analysis of existing methods and by proposing a new trainable evaluation metric and CER method with built-in coherence mechanism, the paper makes valuable contributions towards generating more useful, trustworthy explanations.
