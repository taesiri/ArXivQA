# [Generating Synthetic Documents for Cross-Encoder Re-Rankers: A   Comparative Study of ChatGPT and Human Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02320)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:1) RQ1: How does the effectiveness of cross-encoder re-rankers fine-tuned on ChatGPT-generated responses compare to those fine-tuned on human-generated responses in both supervised and zero-shot settings?2) RQ2: How does the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for generating relevant documents differ between specific and general domains?The authors aim to investigate the usefulness of generative large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in generating training data for cross-encoder re-rankers. Their main hypothesis seems to be that data generated by LLMs like ChatGPT can be used to augment training data for cross-encoder re-rankers, especially in domains with smaller amounts of labeled data. They introduce a new dataset called ChatGPT-RetrievalQA and compare models trained on human vs. ChatGPT generated data. The research questions focus on comparing these models in supervised and zero-shot settings (RQ1), and analyzing differences across domains (RQ2).In summary, the key research questions relate to evaluating ChatGPT for generating training data for cross-encoder re-rankers, in terms of effectiveness in different settings and across domains. The central hypothesis is that ChatGPT-generated data can usefully augment training data for these models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Introducing a new dataset, ChatGPT-RetrievalQA, for evaluating information retrieval models. This dataset is based on an existing dataset HC3 but modified specifically for retrieval tasks.2. Comparing the effectiveness of cross-encoder re-rankers fine-tuned on ChatGPT-generated responses versus human-generated responses. They show that models trained on ChatGPT data perform better in a zero-shot setting, while human-trained models are slightly more effective in a supervised setting. 3. Analyzing the domain-dependency of the results and showing that human-trained models tend to be more effective for domain-specific tasks like medicine. 4. Demonstrating the potential of using generative language models like ChatGPT to create training data for retrieval models, especially in low-resource domains.5. Releasing their dataset, code, and trained models to facilitate future research on using LLMs for data augmentation in information retrieval.In summary, the main contribution seems to be presenting evidence for the usefulness of LLMs in generating synthetic training data for cross-encoder neural rankers, through experiments on their new ChatGPT-RetrievalQA dataset. The authors also analyze the effectiveness across domains and release their resources.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset called ChatGPT-RetrievalQA to compare the effectiveness of cross-encoder neural re-rankers trained on human vs. ChatGPT generated responses, finding that ChatGPT-trained re-rankers perform better in zero-shot settings while human-trained ones are slightly more effective in supervised settings, indicating the potential of using generative models like ChatGPT for data augmentation in information retrieval.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in using large language models for information retrieval:- This paper explores using generative LLM models like ChatGPT to generate synthetic documents for training cross-encoder re-rankers. Most prior work has focused on generating synthetic queries rather than documents. So this explores the reverse direction which provides a novel way to augment training data.- The authors introduce a new dataset ChatGPT-RetrievalQA for this purpose. Most prior work has utilized existing datasets, so this provides a new resource tailored for training cross-encoders with synthetic documents.- The paper tests both supervised and zero-shot effectiveness. Many papers focus only on one setting. Evaluating both provides a more comprehensive view of the potential of LLM-generated data.- The study compares multiple model sizes like MiniLM and TinyBERT. Some papers only evaluate one model architecture. Testing different sizes helps generalize the findings. - Analysis across domains provides insights into where human vs LLM data is more effective. Many papers focus on a single domain, so the domain analysis is a useful contribution.- The paper highlights risks of relying directly on LLM outputs for end users, but shows potential for using it in training. This nuanced view acknowledges limitations while still showing promising capabilities.Overall the paper makes excellent progress in rigorously exploring the novel direction of generating synthetic documents with generative LLM models for augmenting training data in a comprehensive manner across models, domains, and evaluation setups. The domain analysis and insights into human vs LLM data are especially valuable contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Testing the generalizability of their findings with open-source LLMs to determine if the results hold when using models like GPT-3 or GPT-J instead of ChatGPT. The authors note that further work is needed here.- Further analyzing the effect of factually incorrect or hallucinated information in the generated responses on the performance of the cross-encoder re-rankers. The authors suggest this could be an important direction for future work. - Exploring alternative training and evaluation setups where the collection of documents is completely separated between the training and test sets. The authors propose this could help further analyze the potential benefits for the human-trained re-rankers from seeing overlapping documents.- Applying similar techniques on other datasets and domains beyond the ones explored in the paper. The authors' analysis was mainly on a novel dataset based on existing QA datasets, so testing the approaches on other corpora could be useful.- Exploring the viability of similar techniques for other information retrieval tasks beyond re-ranking, such as query expansion and reformulation.- Developing methods to generate synthetic queries rather than documents, as most prior work focused on query generation. The authors briefly mention this as a promising direction.- Combining both synthetic query generation and synthetic document generation to augment training data for retrieval models. The authors' work focused just on document generation.So in summary, some of the key future directions are around testing generalizability, mitigating risks of incorrect responses, trying other training setups, applying the techniques to other datasets and tasks, and exploring joint query and document generation. The authors lay out a good roadmap for next steps in this emerging research area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates using generative language models like ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data for cross-encoder neural re-rankers in information retrieval. The authors introduce a new dataset called ChatGPT-RetrievalQA based on an existing human-ChatGPT comparison dataset. They train cross-encoder re-rankers on either human responses or ChatGPT responses from this dataset. In zero-shot evaluation on MS MARCO and TREC Deep Learning datasets, the ChatGPT-trained cross-encoders significantly outperform the human-trained ones. However, in supervised evaluation on their dataset, the human-trained cross-encoders are slightly more effective, especially in domain-specific tasks like medicine. The authors suggest generative language models show promise for creating training data to make cross-encoders better generalize. They highlight the need to test factuality and generalizability to open-source models. Overall, the paper provides novel insights into using language models like ChatGPT for data augmentation in neural retrieval.
