# [A Cost-Effective Cooperative Exploration and Inspection Strategy for   Heterogeneous Aerial System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Aerial inspection using drones can be time-consuming and noisy if done by a single drone that must fly for a prolonged time. Using multiple drones can improve efficiency but equipping all drones with sensors like LiDAR is expensive. 
- Exploring unknown environments for inspection is challenging due to issues like collision avoidance and communication constraints. Existing methods have limitations in handling large outdoor spaces or complex multi-layered structures.

Proposed Solution:
- A heterogeneous drone swarm system consisting of high-cost mapping drones (Explorer Drones) and lower-cost photographing drones (Photographer Drones).
- An efficient voxel-based coverage strategy and task allocation method to coordinate the drones, tailored for limited communications.
- Explorer Drones first map areas which are handed over to Photographer Drones to capture images, maximizing inspection quality and efficiency.

Key Contributions:  
- A task assignment strategy to group Explorer and Photographer Drones into teams. 
- Methods to allocate inspection sub-regions to teams optimally based on drone proportions.
- Coordinated exploration and inspection strategy customized for limited communications.
- Handling of exploration vs faster inspection trade-off through role divisions.  
- Demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art exploration methods in experiments.
- Open-sourced system to benefit the research community.

In summary, the key idea is an efficient heterogeneous swarm system and strategy for cooperative aerial inspection that maximizes quality and efficiency under constrained conditions. The system demonstrates significantly improved inspection performance compared to previous methods.
