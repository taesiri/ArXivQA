# [DiaHalu: A Dialogue-level Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but hallucination remains a key challenge. Many existing benchmarks for detecting hallucination in LLMs have limitations:
    - Benchmarks often use artificially induced triggers rather than natural LLM outputs. 
    - Most benchmarks focus on factual hallucination, overlooking faithfulness hallucination regarding coherence and relevance.
    - Despite widespread use of dialogue, benchmarks concentrate on sentence and passage-level hallucination.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose DiaHalu, the first dialogue-level hallucination evaluation benchmark. It has the following key features:
    - Covers 4 dialogue domains: knowledge-grounded, task-oriented, chit-chat, reasoning.  
    - Generated via a 3-step process using ChatGPT3.5: integrate topics into system prompts for dialogue; manually edit responses to conform with human language conventions; have LLM re-generate final outputs.
    - Annotated by experts with labels, hallucination types/locations, and explanations. Considers both factuality and faithfulness hallucination (subtypes: incoherence, irrelevance, overreliance, reasoning error).

Main Contributions:
- First dialogue-level benchmark for detecting hallucination in LLMs.  
- Covers diverse realistic dialogue domains and fine-grained hallucination types.
- Experiments show existing LLMs and detection methods perform poorly on it, proving highly challenging and valuable for future research.

In summary, DiaHalu enables evaluating LLMs' tendencies for factual inaccuracies and dialogue incoherence/irrelevance, facilitating development of methods to mitigate hallucination in multi-turn conversational scenarios. As dialogue interfaces become ubiquitous, this represents an important direction.
