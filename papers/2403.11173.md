# [Multi-Objective Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for Recurrent   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Designing neural network (NN) architectures, especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs), is difficult and requires substantial human expertise. 
- Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods for automating NN architecture design mostly focus on feedforward networks and do not consider multiple objectives like model accuracy and complexity. 
- Very limited work exists on multi-objective NAS for RNNs that optimizes model accuracy along with model complexity objectives like number of parameters.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MOE/RNAS, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for automated RNN architecture search. 
- It uses a cell-based encoding to represent RNN architectures. Each cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph with nodes for operations like activations, combinations etc.
- Objectives considered are model accuracy on validation set and model complexity measured by number of blocks. 
- Offspring RNN architectures are generated using network morphism operations like adding/removing units and connections approximated from parent RNNs.
- Selection is based on non-dominated sorting of Pareto front. Destructive morphisms allow optimizing architecture complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Novel multi-objective EA-based NAS method specifically for RNN architecture search, considering model accuracy and RNN architecture complexity objectives.
- New RNN architecture block encoding scheme to represent RNN cell architectures, supporting destructive transformations. 
- Approximate RNN morphism operations to inherit trained parameters from parent to offspring RNNs for efficiency.
- Empirical analysis showing the method can evolve novel RNN architectures dominating manually designed RNNs in terms of accuracy vs complexity tradeoffs.

In summary, the paper proposes a specialized multi-objective EA method for efficient RNN architecture search optimizing for accuracy and complexity, with novel RNN encoding, morphism operations and empirical validation.
