# [ColorVideoVDP: A visual difference predictor for image, video and   display distortions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Evaluating the visual quality of images and videos is critical for many applications like graphics, video streaming, and display engineering. However, existing quality metrics often ignore important aspects of human vision like color perception or temporal vision. They also do not account for viewing conditions and display characteristics. These limitations make them unsuitable for emerging use cases like assessing quality in wide gamut and VR/AR displays. 

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces ColorVideoVDP, a full-reference quality and difference metric for images and video that models spatial, temporal, and chromatic vision jointly. It relies on the novel castleCSF model of spatiotemporal chromatic contrast sensitivity and a cross-channel masking model. The metric transforms the test and reference content using a display model that accounts for size, resolution, color gamut, luminance range and viewing distance. The frames are then decomposed into opponent color channels, temporal channels, and spatial bands mimicking the visual system. A core masking model compares the multiscale band-limited contrast between test and reference, transforming contrast differences into a perceptual scale. These differences are pooled across bands, channels and frames to predict quality on a 0-10 JOD scale that correlates with subjective judgments.

Main Contributions:
- First quality metric to model spatiotemporal and chromatic vision together for video assessment 
- Relies on novel castleCSF model of chromatic contrast sensitivity
- Accounts for display characteristics and viewing conditions
- Models cross-channel masking between luminance and chromatic channels
- Validated on a novel psychophysical quality dataset of AR/VR display artifacts (XR-DAVID)
- Trained and tested on multiple SDR/HDR image and video quality datasets  
- Differentiable implementation enables use in optimization and design
- Provides interpretation through visualizations like heatmap and distogram

The metric sets a new state-of-the-art for quality assessment and enables novel applications in graphics, video streaming, and display engineering that require spatiotemporal evaluation of chromatic distortions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

ColorVideoVDP is a new full-reference image and video quality metric that models spatial, temporal, and chromatic aspects of human vision to predict visibility of distortions in luminance, color, and across time while accounting for viewing conditions and display characteristics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is ColorVideoVDP, a new visual difference predictor for images and videos that models spatial, temporal, and chromatic aspects of human vision simultaneously. Key novelties include:

- A psychophysical model of chromatic spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity and cross-channel masking (castleCSF).

- Accounting for display characteristics like size, resolution, color gamut, etc. 

- Modeling common video artifacts like compression and transmission errors, as well as emerging AR/VR display artifacts.

- Introduction of a new quality dataset, XR-DAVID, with diverse color video distortions.

- Significantly improved prediction performance over existing metrics, while still being efficient to compute.

The paper demonstrates that modeling color, temporal, and display aspects together is critical for an accurate quality/difference metric. This enables new applications like optimizing video streaming/graphics pipelines, display specification and design, algorithm benchmarking, etc. Overall, ColorVideoVDP pushes the state-of-the-art in perceptually-guided quality assessment.

The paper presents a new visual difference predictor called ColorVideoVDP for assessing the quality of images and videos. It models various aspects of human vision including spatiotemporal, chromatic, and cross-channel contrast masking. The metric is built on psychophysical models and can account for display characteristics and viewing conditions. It was tested on datasets containing common artifacts found in AR/VR displays as well as video compression and transmission distortions. The predictions are expressed on a unified JOD quality scale as well as via distortion maps and distograms. So the key terms reflect this focus on modeling color and spatiotemporal vision for quality assessment of images and video.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new visual difference predictor called ColorVideoVDP. What are the key capabilities and limitations of this metric compared to previous methods? What aspects of human vision does it model that have not been modeled before?

2. The metric relies on a novel psychophysical model of chromatic spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity called castleCSF. What are the key components and assumptions behind this model? How was it optimized and validated? 

3. Contrast masking is a critical part of the new metric. Explain the cross-channel masking model used in ColorVideoVDP. What are its main strengths compared to other masking models considered by the authors?

4. The pooling stage combines differences across space, time, channels, and frequency bands. Discuss the rationale behind the specific pooling exponents selected in Eq. 11. How sensitive is performance to changes in these hyperparameters?  

5. The metric converts differences into just-objectionable-difference (JOD) units. Explain how JODs are defined, including the concept of matching inter-observer variance. What are the practical benefits of this scaling?

6. Training the metric end-to-end on full resolution video is infeasible due to memory constraints. Discuss the mixture of feature space and pixel space training used instead. What are the relative pros and cons?

7. The new XR-DAVID dataset focuses specifically on emerging display artifacts. Why were these distortions selected? How do the corresponding human judgments compare to traditional compression artifacts?  

8. Analyze the benchmarking results in Figure 9. Why does ColorVideoVDP outperform prior metrics, especially on the XR-DAVID dataset? Where does it still fall short?

9. Discuss some of the new applications demonstrated, including tolerance specification for displays, and modeling observer metamerism. What other novel use cases could you propose? 

10. The method has several limitations mentioned by the authors, including lack of saliency and annoyance models. Propose an extension to ColorVideoVDP to address one such limitation. What specific psychophysical data would need to be modeled?
