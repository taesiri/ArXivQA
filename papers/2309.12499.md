# [CodePlan: Repository-level Coding using LLMs and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research goals/questions addressed in this paper are:

1. How to automate complex repository-level coding tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs)? The paper identifies a class of software engineering tasks like migration, bug fixing etc. that require code changes across a large codebase rather than localized edits. It aims to develop a technique to systematically propagate code changes across dependent code to automate such tasks.

2. How to analyze the effects of code changes made by an LLM and propagate them across the codebase? The paper frames repository-level coding as a planning problem to generate a sequence of code changes (plan) that can be actuated by an LLM. It proposes a technique combining incremental dependency analysis, change impact analysis, and adaptive planning to analyze code changes and guide further edits.

3. How does the proposed technique compare against simpler baselines that use build errors or type errors to identify necessary code changes? The paper empirically evaluates the proposed technique called CodePlan on migration and temporal editing tasks and compares it to baselines that rely on build/type errors. It aims to demonstrate CodePlan's superiority in aligning with ground truth changes.

4. Can the proposed technique handle real-world large codebases requiring many interdependent changes? The paper tests CodePlan on 6 code repositories, including proprietary ones, with 2-97 files requiring changes. It aims to show that CodePlan can successfully propagate changes across large real-world codebases for complex tasks not previously automated using LLMs.

In summary, the core research goals are developing a technique to automate complex repository-level coding tasks using LLMs, propagating code changes systematically across the codebase, and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness over baselines on real-world repositories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a novel framework called CodePlan to automate repository-level coding tasks using large language models (LLMs) and planning. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Formulating the problem of automating complex coding tasks that require edits across an entire code repository, which has not been addressed before using LLMs. 

2. Proposing to frame repository-level coding as a planning problem and designing CodePlan, a task-agnostic framework to solve it.

3. CodePlan uses a combination of incremental dependency analysis, change impact analysis, and adaptive planning to create a chain of edits to be performed by an LLM across the repository.

4. Evaluating CodePlan on two repository-level tasks - package migration and temporal code edits - on C# and Python repositories. The results show CodePlan is able to produce edit chains that are better aligned with ground truth compared to baselines.

5. CodePlan is able to get 5 out of 6 repositories to pass validity checks like building without errors after the edits, whereas baselines fail to pass checks for any repository.

In summary, the key innovation is using planning and static analysis to systematically propagate code changes made by an LLM across repository dependencies, enabling automation of complex repository-level coding tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents CodePlan, a novel framework that uses incremental dependency analysis, change impact analysis, and adaptive planning to automate complex repository-level coding tasks by orchestrating chained code edits from large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents CodePlan, a novel framework for automating complex repository-level coding tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and planning. Here is a summary of how it relates to other recent work in this area:

- Contextualization for LLMs: Many recent papers have explored providing better context to LLMs to improve their performance on coding tasks, through spatial context from the codebase structure and dependencies, and temporal context from edit history. CodePlan incorporates both forms of context in a unified framework by maintaining a dependency graph and monitoring code changes.

- Repository-level coding: Other papers have formulated tasks like bug fixing, specification addition, refactoring etc at a repository scale. CodePlan is unique in framing it as a planning problem and synthesizing a multi-step chain of edits to complete the task. Most existing techniques assume the developer will specify the next location to edit. 

- Automated program repair: Some techniques like Getafix learn common bug fix patterns from commits and apply them to repair bugs. CodePlan does not assume similarity between edits. It relies on monitoring the effects of each edit and propagating changes across dependencies.

- Impact analysis: Incremental program analysis techniques analyze the impact of code changes to focus recomputation. CodePlan performs novel change may-impact analysis tailored to guide an LLM.

- Planning: Existing applications of planning in SE automate pipeline construction or complex program synthesis problems. CodePlan's use of planning to create a chain of code edits at a repository scale is novel.

In summary, CodePlan brings together ideas like contextualization of LLMs, repository-level coding, impact analysis and planning in a unique combination to solve a new problem formulation. The evaluation shows it is superior to iterative repair just using the compiler errors. The idea of synthesizing a coherent chain of edits across a large codebase is a novel contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Expanding the applicability of CodePlan to more programming languages and code artifacts beyond just C# and Python source code files. The authors mention expanding it to handle configuration files, metadata, and external dependencies to make it a more holistic solution.

- Further customization of the change may-impact analysis in CodePlan, such as incorporating task-specific impact analysis rules using rule-based methods or machine learning techniques. This could help fine-tune the editing decisions for specific coding tasks. 

- Handling more complex and dynamic dependencies beyond just the static dependencies currently analyzed. Examples given include data flow dependencies, complex dynamic dispatching, algorithmic dependencies like expecting sorted input lists, and execution dependencies like multi-threading. Expanding the dependency analysis would allow CodePlan to address a wider range of software tasks.

- Evaluating CodePlan on larger and more complex real-world codebases to further validate its applicability and scalability. The examples used so far are relatively small in scale.

- Exploring alternative approaches to adaptive planning, such as using machine learning based methods instead of the rule-based approach currently used. This could improve the planning and edit propagation.

- Improving the user interaction, explainability and transparency of CodePlan to make it more usable and trustworthy as a practical software engineering tool.

- Comparing CodePlan to other techniques and tools for repository-level coding tasks beyond just the baselines used in the paper.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the languages, dependencies, code artifacts, and tasks handled by CodePlan, improving its analysis components through ML and rules, evaluating it on larger real-world code, and enhancing the usability and transparency.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents CodePlan, a novel framework for automating repository-level coding tasks using large language models (LLMs) and planning. Repository-level coding tasks involve making inter-dependent changes across an entire code repository, which is challenging for LLMs alone. CodePlan formulates the problem as an automated planning task. It analyzes code dependencies and the effects of code changes to synthesize a multi-step plan of edits to be performed by an LLM. CodePlan provides both spatial context across the repository and temporal context of past edits to guide the LLM. It was evaluated on package migration and temporal code editing tasks for C# and Python repositories, showing improved accuracy over baselines. CodePlan demonstrates an effective approach to leveraging LLMs for complex, repository-level coding automation through planning and contextualization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called CodePlan to automate repository-level coding tasks using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Repository-level coding tasks involve making inter-dependent code changes across multiple files in a codebase, such as migrating to a new API or fixing issues reported by a static analyzer. CodePlan frames the problem as a planning task and creates a plan to guide an LLM in making a chain of code edits to complete the task. It maintains a dependency graph of code blocks and analyzes the impact of each code edit made by the LLM. Based on this impact analysis, it identifies new code blocks that need edits and extends the plan. CodePlan also provides relevant spatial context from related code and temporal context from the history of edits to the LLM when generating each code edit. In the evaluation on package migration and temporal editing tasks for C# and Python repositories, CodePlan achieved better accuracy than baselines in matching ground truth edits and in getting repositories to pass validity checks like building without errors.

In summary, CodePlan makes the key contributions of (1) formulating repository-level coding as a planning problem, (2) devising a combination of dependency analysis, change impact analysis, and adaptive planning to create chains of code edits, (3) providing spatial and temporal contexts to the LLM, and (4) experimentally demonstrating that planning and contextualization enables repository-level coding automation using LLMs. The results show promise in using CodePlan to automate complex software engineering tasks needing coordinated edits across a codebase.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a system called CodePlan for automating repository-level coding tasks using large language models (LLMs). CodePlan frames repository-level coding as a planning problem and combines incremental dependency analysis, change may-impact analysis, and adaptive planning to generate a multi-step chain of edits to be performed by an LLM. Specifically, CodePlan constructs a plan graph where nodes are code edit obligations and edges indicate interdependencies between edits. It executes the plan iteratively by extracting code fragments, gathering spatial and temporal context, prompting the LLM to generate edits, merging edited code into the repository, and updating the dependency graph. After each edit, CodePlan analyzes the impact on dependent code and extends the plan graph with new obligations. This adaptive planning allows CodePlan to propagate changes across the repository and get it into a valid end state where it passes checks like building without errors. The method is evaluated on tasks like package migration and temporal code editing over C# and Python repositories.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to automate complex code editing tasks across an entire code repository using large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the paper identifies a class of "repository-level coding tasks" that require propagating changes across multiple interdependent files in a codebase, such as migrating to a new API or fixing issues reported by static analysis. These tasks go beyond localized coding problems that can be solved by just invoking an LLM once. 

The main research question seems to be: how can we systematically orchestrate and monitor a chain of edits by an LLM across a code repository to accomplish a high-level repository-level coding task?

To address this, the paper proposes a framework called CodePlan that combines dependency analysis, change impact analysis, and adaptive planning to break down the high-level task into a series of code edit obligations. It incrementally calls the LLM to make edits, analyzes the effects of those changes, and plans follow-up edits to dependent code, iteratively driving the repository towards a consistent state.

So in summary, the key problem is automating complex, multi-step code editing tasks across large, interdependent code repositories in a scalable and reliable way. The paper proposes a novel approach combining LLMs, static analysis, and automated planning to address this problem.
