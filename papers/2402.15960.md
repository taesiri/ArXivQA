# [Budget-Constrained Tool Learning with Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing tool learning methods for large language models (LLMs) aim to effectively resolve user queries, but overlook budget constraints in real-world scenarios where using tools incurs monetary/time costs. 
- Allocating budget optimally is challenging without a comprehensive understanding of the overall tool learning process. Trial-and-error methods are inefficient and risk exceeding budgets.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Budget-Constrained Tool Learning with Planning (BTP) to resolve user queries within a specified budget constraint.
- Key ideas:
   - Before using tools, create a preferable "plan" outlining candidate tools and maximum usage frequencies under the budget constraint. This provides a comprehensive budget allocation overview. 
   - Formulate plan creation as a knapsack problem using dynamic programming. Estimate tool value and usage frequencies based on past experience to avoid real usage costs.
   - During tool learning, prevent the LLM from using tools more times than the frequency limits in the plan.
   - Use a blacklist to prevent repeated useless tool invocations.

Main Contributions:
- First study focused specifically on budget-constrained tool learning for LLMs.
- Propose tool usage planning technique to provide overview for allocating budget. Planning formulated as knapsack problem and solved efficiently.
- Blacklisting further reduces costs by avoiding repeated useless tool usage.
- Experiments show BTP combines easily with existing methods and substantially improves performance under strict budget constraints.

In summary, the key novelty is introducing tool usage planning and formulating budget allocation as an optimization problem to constrain costs for tool learning.
