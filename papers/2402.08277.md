# [Towards Faithful and Robust LLM Specialists for Evidence-Based   Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 still struggle with evidence-based question answering, where they need to answer questions by citing relevant sources. Specifically, existing LLMs have issues with citing the correct sources (source quality) and truthfully representing the information from the sources (answer attributability).

- Open-sourced LLMs perform even worse than commercial LLMs on evidence-based QA. So there is a need for methods to improve the performance of open-sourced LLMs. 

- Prior work on instruction tuning of LLMs using synthesized data faces challenges with data quality and model overfitting.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a pipeline to synthesize a diversified evidence-based QA dataset called SynSciQA at scale. The pipeline also has filters to refine the data and ensure higher quality, leading to SynSciQA+ and SynSciQA++.

- They collect 4 test sets with different distances to the training data to benchmark in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.

- They fine-tune open-sourced LLMs like LLama and Zephyr on SynSciQA datasets and evaluate on the test sets.

Main Contributions:
- Show data quality matters more than quantity for evidence-based QA fine-tuning. The quality filters lead to better performance.

- Demonstrate synthetic data fine-tuning reliably improves both in-distribution and OOD performance on evidence-based QA.

- Find that overfitting exists during fine-tuning. Performance on synthetic dev set strongly correlates with OOD test performance.

- Propose reproducibility benchmarks, metrics and analyses to advance research on more traceable QA with open-sourced LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a data generation pipeline and quality control techniques to create synthetic evidence-based question answering datasets for fine-tuning large language models to become more faithful and robust specialists, and introduces test sets to benchmark performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. Proposing a data generation pipeline to obtain fine-tuning data for Evidence-Based QA at scale. The pipeline ensures data diversity and quality through automated filters.

2. Introducing four test sets to benchmark the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance of fine-tuned Evidence-Based QA specialist models.

3. Conducting extensive experiments showing that (a) data quality matters more than quantity for Evidence-Based QA fine-tuning, (b) fine-tuning on synthetic data improves performance on both in- and out-of-distribution test sets, and (c) performance on in-domain synthetic data substantially correlates with out-of-distribution performance.

In summary, the paper systematically investigates how to robustly fine-tune large language models into faithful evidence-based question answering specialists, through scalable synthetic data generation and rigorous in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes automatic quality filters to improve the quality of synthesized training data for evidence-based question answering. What are some potential ways to further refine or expand these filters to handle more complex cases?

2. The paper uses both source quality and answer attributability metrics to evaluate evidence-based QA performance. What other evaluation metrics could be useful to capture additional quality dimensions like helpfulness or coherence? 

3. The paper shows that higher quality synthetic data leads to better performance even when controlling for quantity. What explanations could there be for why quality matters more than quantity in this setting?

4. The paper demonstrates improved performance on out-of-distribution test sets after fine-tuning on synthetic data. What factors affect how well synthetic fine-tuning transfers to real-world distributions, and how can this transfer be further improved?  

5. The paper hypothesizes that findings using their single prompt template may transfer to other prompt designs. What experiments could be done to verify this hypothesis and understand how prompt engineering affects evidence-based QA fine-tuning?

6. The paper uses aggregation of multiple neural entailment models to evaluate answer attributability. What alternative methods could be used for entailment prediction and how might they compare in accuracy?

7. The paper shows higher attribution scores correlate with human judgments, but what other validation approaches could strengthen confidence in automatic evaluation?

8. The paper observes overfitting trends after multiple fine-tuning epochs. What techniques could help prevent or reduce overfitting to synthetic training data in this setting?

9. The paper focuses on improving faithfulness, but what modifications to the method could better capture the helpfulness dimension?

10. The method is evaluated on scientific QA data. How well might it transfer to evidence-based QA in other domains like medicine, law, or literature?
