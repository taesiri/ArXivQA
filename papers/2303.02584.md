# [Super-Resolution Neural Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02584)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an image super-resolution method that can generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs at arbitrary scaling factors. Specifically, the paper proposes a new deep learning architecture called Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SRNO) to achieve this goal. The key ideas are:- Treat images as continuous functions that are sampled at different resolutions, and formulate super-resolution as learning a mapping between function spaces.- Use a neural operator architecture with lifting, iterative kernel integrals, and projection to learn this mapping while maintaining continuity. - Implement the kernel integral using a Galerkin-type attention mechanism to capture global relationships and allow dynamic updating of instance-specific bases.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that modeling super-resolution as a continuous mapping of function spaces using a neural operator framework with Galerkin attention can enable high-quality image SR at arbitrary scales. The experiments aim to validate the superiority of SRNO over previous continuous SR methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SRNO), a deep operator learning framework that can resolve high-resolution (HR) images at arbitrary scales from low-resolution (LR) counterparts. - It treats LR-HR image pairs as continuous functions approximated with different grid sizes, and learns mappings between corresponding approximation spaces.- It uses a kernel integral implemented via Galerkin-type attention, which possesses non-local properties and benefits the grid-free continuum.- The multilayer attention architecture allows dynamic latent basis update, which is important for SR to "hallucinate" high-frequency information.- Experiments show SRNO outperforms existing continuous SR methods in accuracy and speed.In summary, the key novelty is using neural operator learning for continuous super-resolution, enabled by Galerkin-type attention to capture non-local structure and allow dynamic basis update. This achieves state-of-the-art performance for arbitrary-scale super-resolution.
