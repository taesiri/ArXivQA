# [Super-Resolution Neural Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02584)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an image super-resolution method that can generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs at arbitrary scaling factors. Specifically, the paper proposes a new deep learning architecture called Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SRNO) to achieve this goal. The key ideas are:- Treat images as continuous functions that are sampled at different resolutions, and formulate super-resolution as learning a mapping between function spaces.- Use a neural operator architecture with lifting, iterative kernel integrals, and projection to learn this mapping while maintaining continuity. - Implement the kernel integral using a Galerkin-type attention mechanism to capture global relationships and allow dynamic updating of instance-specific bases.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that modeling super-resolution as a continuous mapping of function spaces using a neural operator framework with Galerkin attention can enable high-quality image SR at arbitrary scales. The experiments aim to validate the superiority of SRNO over previous continuous SR methods.
