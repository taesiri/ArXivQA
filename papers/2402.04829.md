# [NeRF as Non-Distant Environment Emitter in Physics-based Inverse   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Physics-based inverse rendering aims to reconstruct the shape, material, and lighting of a scene from images by optimizing them to match the rendered images with the input images. Accurate lighting modeling is important for high-quality reconstruction. Commonly used environment maps assume distant lighting, which is often violated in real scenes, leading to inaccuracies in inverse rendering.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to model the environment lighting instead of an environment map. Compared to environment maps that model a 2D distant radiance field, NeRF can represent a 3D non-distant radiance field residing on volumetric densities. This allows modeling spatial varying radiance to handle non-distant lighting.  

The scene is represented as a hybrid of explicit surfaces with materials inside a bounding region, and a surrounding NeRF modeling the environment lighting. A differentiable renderer is formulated to render this hybrid scene. An emitter importance sampling method is devised to sample directions from the NeRF during rendering.

An optimization pipeline first trains a NeRF on the entire scene, fuses geometry from the NeRF density, and uses it to initialize surface shape. Then it performs joint optimization of shape, material, and NeRF lighting to match rendered images with input images.

Contributions:
- Using NeRF to represent non-distant environment lighting for more accurate modeling than environment maps
- Formulating a hybrid rendering equation combining explicit surfaces and a NeRF
- Devising an emitter importance sampling method for NeRF
- An optimization pipeline using NeRF to initialize and jointly optimize shape, material and lighting

Results:
Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with non-distant lighting show that the proposed NeRF emitter can more accurately model lighting and achieve higher quality inverse rendering than methods using an environment map.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed NeRF-based solution, the hybrid rendering formulation, the emitter sampling method, and optimization pipeline that are the main technical contributions. It also briefly describes the experiments showing the advantage of using NeRF over environment maps for modeling non-distant lighting in inverse rendering.
