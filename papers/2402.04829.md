# [NeRF as Non-Distant Environment Emitter in Physics-based Inverse   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Physics-based inverse rendering aims to reconstruct the shape, material, and lighting of a scene from images by optimizing them to match the rendered images with the input images. Accurate lighting modeling is important for high-quality reconstruction. Commonly used environment maps assume distant lighting, which is often violated in real scenes, leading to inaccuracies in inverse rendering.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to model the environment lighting instead of an environment map. Compared to environment maps that model a 2D distant radiance field, NeRF can represent a 3D non-distant radiance field residing on volumetric densities. This allows modeling spatial varying radiance to handle non-distant lighting.  

The scene is represented as a hybrid of explicit surfaces with materials inside a bounding region, and a surrounding NeRF modeling the environment lighting. A differentiable renderer is formulated to render this hybrid scene. An emitter importance sampling method is devised to sample directions from the NeRF during rendering.

An optimization pipeline first trains a NeRF on the entire scene, fuses geometry from the NeRF density, and uses it to initialize surface shape. Then it performs joint optimization of shape, material, and NeRF lighting to match rendered images with input images.

Contributions:
- Using NeRF to represent non-distant environment lighting for more accurate modeling than environment maps
- Formulating a hybrid rendering equation combining explicit surfaces and a NeRF
- Devising an emitter importance sampling method for NeRF
- An optimization pipeline using NeRF to initialize and jointly optimize shape, material and lighting

Results:
Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with non-distant lighting show that the proposed NeRF emitter can more accurately model lighting and achieve higher quality inverse rendering than methods using an environment map.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed NeRF-based solution, the hybrid rendering formulation, the emitter sampling method, and optimization pipeline that are the main technical contributions. It also briefly describes the experiments showing the advantage of using NeRF over environment maps for modeling non-distant lighting in inverse rendering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using a neural radiance field (NeRF) to model non-distant environmental lighting in physics-based inverse rendering to achieve more accurate reconstruction of shape, materials, and lighting compared to using an environment map.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent the environment lighting in physics-based inverse rendering. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that the commonly used environment map lighting assumption leads to inaccurate results when the lighting is not infinitely distant. In contrast, NeRF can better model non-distant lighting with spatial varying effects.

2) The paper derives a novel hybrid rendering equation that combines surface rendering and NeRF volume rendering to render scenes with both geometric surfaces and NeRF lighting.

3) The paper proposes an emitter importance sampling method for NeRF to enable using NeRF as an emitter light source in differentiable Monte Carlo rendering.

4) The paper builds an inverse rendering pipeline that can jointly optimize shape, material and NeRF lighting from images. Both synthetic and real results demonstrate that using a NeRF emitter leads to more accurate inverse rendering compared to using an environment map.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that NeRF can be effectively adapted as a non-distant environment emitter in inverse rendering to achieve more robust and accurate results compared to the commonly used environment map assumption.

3. The method requires devising a specialized sampling technique for the NeRF emitter. Explain the emitter importance sampling approach proposed in Section 3.2 and discuss why existing sampling strategies are insufficient for handling a NeRF emitter. 

4. The optimization procedure utilizes a multi-stage approach, first reconstructing the scene with NeRF and then switching representation. Walk through the motivation and workflow of this optimization strategy. What are the benefits of using NeRF to initialize inverse rendering?

5. The method requires capturing HDR, multi-view datasets with multiple lighting conditions. Explain the specialized capture setup and discuss the considerations that motivate this type of data capture. How does this data facilitate robust optimization in the presence of non-distant lighting?

8. Pick one real dataset result (Figure 5) and analyze the visual differences between the proposed method and baseline. Identify key artifacts in the baseline and discuss how the NeRF emitter representation alleviates them.

9. Consider the limitations discussed in Section 6. Propose an extension or modification to the current method that could help address its increased computational cost. Discuss the motivation and expected benefits. 

10. The current emitter sampling method makes simplifying assumptions about the NeRF radiance field. Propose an improved sampling approach that relaxes these assumptions, and discuss how it could further reduce variance.
