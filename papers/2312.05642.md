# [Speed Up Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environment: A Dynamic   Tiering Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Training large deep learning models using federated learning is challenging when the clients are resource-constrained devices with heterogeneous computation/communication capacities and varying dataset sizes. Such heterogeneity causes significant variability in client training times, leading to longer overall training times and under-utilization of faster clients (straggler problem).

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Dynamic Tiering-based Federated Learning (DTFL) system to address these challenges. The key ideas are:

1. Clients are divided into tiers based on their training speeds. In different tiers, varying portions of the global model are offloaded from clients onto the server to meet their resource constraints.

2. Clients and server update their respective parts of the model in parallel using local loss signals only. This eliminates waiting for gradients from the server, reducing latency. 

3. A dynamic tier scheduler assigns clients to suitable tiers before each round based on tier profiling. Using historical training times and communication speeds, expected training times are estimated across tiers. Scheduling aims to minimize the maximum expected training time.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a multi-tier federated learning approach that can offload differing portions of a global model onto clients based on their capabilities. Enables training large models on resource-constrained devices.

- Develops a dynamic tier assignment strategy that profiles expected training time across tiers and assigns clients appropriately. Mitigates impact of heterogeneous capacities and stragglers.  

- Clients and server update models independently using local loss signals only. Eliminates gradient synchronization and reduces latency.

- Provides convergence analysis for both convex and non-convex loss functions.

- Experiments on large CNNs and datasets demonstrate significantly reduced overall training times compared to state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms, without loss of accuracy.

In summary, the paper makes federated learning more efficient for heterogeneous environments by dynamic tiering and localized loss-based training. The techniques can enable training complex models on resource-limited devices.
