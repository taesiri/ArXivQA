# [Stuck in the Quicksand of Numeracy, Far from AGI Summit: Evaluating   LLMs' Mathematical Competency through Ontology-guided Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Assessing the true depth and robustness of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning remains an open question, despite impressive performance on some benchmarks.  
- The paper aims to provide a more rigorous evaluation mechanism to understand the limitations of LLMs' numeric reasoning abilities across different perturbation dimensions.

Methodology
- The paper develops an ontology of perturbations for mathematical word problems across multiple factors related to problem structure, representation, logic and concepts.
- Using GPT-4, the authors generate a dataset called MORE of 216 questions by perturbing 5 seed GSM8K questions based on 44 perturbation types from the ontology. This involves automatic generation, filtering and human verification.
- The perturbed questions modify problems in terms of complexity, constraints, format, commonsense assumptions etc. to evaluate model robustness.

Experiments
- The authors evaluate GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Metamath, Llama and Gemini on MORE dataset under zero-shot setting.
- Manual evaluation is used instead of string matching to handle open-ended concept analysis questions.
- Results show significant performance drop for all models, with GPT-4 having the most resilience. This indicates lack of deep mathematical reasoning skills.

Contributions
- Novel ontology of mathematical problem perturbations and semi-automatic method to generate them
- MORE dataset of 216 questions for mathematically evaluating LLMs
- Analysis highlighting fragility of LLMs' capabilities based on results on MORE dataset
- Framework for gaining insights into limitations of LLMs to guide further development

The paper makes key contributions in generating controlled perturbations to reliably evaluate LLMs on mathematical reasoning, exposing the models' vulnerabilities. The proposed evaluation methodology and findings pave the path for enhancing LLMs' mathematical competencies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an ontology of perturbations for mathematical word problems, uses it to semi-automatically create a dataset of 216 perturbed problems from 5 GSM8K seed questions, and evaluates several state-of-the-art LLMs to demonstrate significant performance drops, indicating their lack of robust numeric reasoning skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel extensive extensible ontology of perturbation operations to math word problems. This ontology systematically defines different types of perturbations that can be introduced in math questions to evaluate the robustness and reasoning abilities of language models.

2. Providing a semi-automatic method to generate perturbed math questions guided by the ontology. This involves using GPT-4 to generate initial perturbations, followed by extensive human filtering and validation. 

3. Introducing a new dataset called \dataset (Mathematics-oriented Robustness Evaluation) comprising 216 perturbed math questions starting from just 5 seed questions in GSM8K. This dataset covers diverse perturbations defined in the ontology.

4. Comprehensively evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini etc. on \dataset. The results reveal significant performance drops compared to original GSM8K questions, indicating fragility of language models' math reasoning skills.

5. The proposed ontology, dataset generation technique and evaluation methodology provide a novel testbed to thoroughly assess mathematical capabilities of language models. This transcends conventional accuracy metrics to offer more nuanced insights into the models' limitations and challenges.

In summary, the key contribution is an extensive framework encompassing the ontology, dataset and evaluation approach to rigorously test language models' proficiency, robustness and depth of understanding for mathematical reasoning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the ontology of perturbations provide a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs' mathematical capabilities compared to existing benchmarks? What are some of the key limitations it reveals that other benchmarks may overlook?

2. The semi-automatic perturbation generation process involves an initial automatic generation step by GPT-4 followed by extensive human verification and validation. What are some of the key challenges and trade-offs in balancing automation with human oversight in this methodology? 

3. The paper argues that creating "complex" or "adversarially harder" benchmarks may not effectively probe the limits of LLMs' reasoning abilities. How does the approach of controlled, ontology-guided perturbations better assess the depth versus breadth of mathematical understanding?

4. What implications does the significant drop in performance of LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the perturbed questions have for their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring numeric reasoning?

5. How reusable and extensible is the proposed ontology framework for creating perturbations in other logical reasoning domains like computer code generation? What modifications would be required?

6. The format change category tests robustness across input and output formats. What other tests of robustness - for example, across different languages or terminology - would provide additional insights into the limitations of LLMs?  

7. How do the results shed light on the ability of LLMs to detect contradictions or errors in mathematical problems? What improvements are needed to make their capabilities more reliable?

8. The evaluation relied extensively on human judgement rather than automated metrics. What are some ways the evaluation protocol could be strengthened or supplemented with automated scoring methods?

9. What types of architectural changes could make LLMs more capable of the symbolic manipulation and reasoning required for many of the perturbation categories like the symbolic reasoning questions?

10. How do the insights from this analysis of strengths and limitations inform the future development of LLMs specialized for mathematical and logical applications rather than general language tasks? What should their training methodology focus on?
