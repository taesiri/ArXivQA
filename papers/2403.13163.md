## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Image deblurring is an important task but remains challenging, especially for real-world blurry images which often contain complex blur patterns. Existing methods have limitations - CNNs have limited receptive fields while Transformers are computationally expensive and may fail to capture local patterns. 

Solution: 
The paper proposes DeblurDiNAT, a compact and effective Transformer for image deblurring. The main ideas are:

1) Alternating Dilation Factor Structure: Uses dilated self-attention with alternating dilation factors to enable efficient learning of both global and local blur features.

2) Channel Modulation Self-Attention (CMSA): Proposes a parallel design with a cross-channel learner to modulate the self-attention features and model cross-channel interactions.

3) Divide and Multiply Feedforward Network (DMFN): A simplified feedforward design without non-linearities for efficient feature propagation.  

4) Lightweight Gated Feature Fusion (LGFF): An effective and lightweight feature fusion method for multi-scale and single-scale features.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes DeblurDiNAT, a compact and effective Transformer for image deblurring which captures both global and local blur features efficiently.
- Introduces 4 key designs - ADFS, CMSA, DMFN and LGFF to enhance efficiency and efficacy of Transformers for deblurring. 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster speed and fewer parameters than top methods. Demonstrates superior generalization ability.
- Provides extensive analysis and comparisons to highlight the improvements from each of the main ideas.

In summary, the paper makes Transformer-based image deblurring more practical by improving efficiency and efficacy through several novel and analyzed designs within the compact DeblurDiNAT architecture.
