# [SynJax: Structured Probability Distributions for JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to facilitate building large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model structure in data. Specifically, the paper introduces SynJax, a library for JAX that provides efficient vectorized implementations of various structured probability distributions and their associated inference algorithms. The goal is to make it easy for users to incorporate structured modeling components like trees and alignments into their JAX models without having to implement custom inference algorithms themselves. The paper argues that while libraries like JAX have enabled progress in deep learning for models like Transformers, structured probability models have lagged behind due to the lack of libraries providing efficient structured components. SynJax aims to fill this gap.So in summary, the main research question is: How can we enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to make structured modeling more accessible and scalable? SynJax provides a solution to this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing SynJax, a library for structured probability distributions in JAX. Specifically:- SynJax provides efficient vectorized implementations of inference algorithms for structured distributions like sequences, alignments, trees, and spanning trees. This enables building large-scale differentiable models in JAX that explicitly capture structure in data.- SynJax offers a unified interface for specifying structured distributions just by setting a few boolean flags. It handles picking the optimal inference algorithm under the hood based on the distribution constraints. This simplifies modeling and removes the need for users to implement inference algorithms themselves. - SynJax supports computing various inference quantities like sampling, finding the most probable structure, marginal probabilities, entropy, etc. It does this by using automatic differentiation on the implementations of partition functions.- SynJax includes distributions and algorithms not found in other JAX libraries for probabilistic modeling. It also benchmarks faster than comparable libraries like Torch-Struct.- SynJax is designed to be easy to use - it is compatible with JAX transformations like vmap, uses Jaxtyping for documentation and type checking, and builds on top of other JAX libraries.In summary, SynJax makes it much easier to develop and deploy large scale structured probabilistic models in JAX by providing efficient building blocks and a simple interface. This could enable more research into structured alternatives to auto-regressive models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on SynJax compares to other related research:- Focus on computational efficiency for structured prediction models. This paper emphasizes optimizing the speed and memory usage of algorithms for various types of structured outputs, allowing their use in large-scale deep learning models. Other work has focused more on modeling capabilities or algorithm correctness.- Implementation in JAX. SynJax is designed specifically for JAX and hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Other libraries like Torch-Struct target PyTorch. There are tradeoffs between frameworks, but JAX optimization can provide significant speedups.- Unified interface for many structure types. SynJax supports distributions over alignments, trees, segmentations, etc. with a simple unified API. Most other libraries specialize in one structure family. This provides modeling flexibility.- Leverages automatic differentiation for inference. By using autodiff for computing partition functions, marginals, etc., SynJax avoids reimplementing specialized algorithms. This is an elegant approach enabled by JAX.- Addition of non-projective spanning trees. Previous libraries lacked support for unrestricted non-projective spanning trees. SynJax fills this gap with efficient implementations.- Focus on deep structured models. Many earlier papers on structured prediction focused on standalone models. By integrating with JAX, SynJax allows combining neural networks with statistical structured models.Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in structured prediction for deep learning in terms of efficiency, scope of structures supported, simplicity of use, and integration with modern ML frameworks. It opens up new modeling capabilities compared to prior work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces SynJax, a new library for structured probability distributions built on top of JAX. SynJax provides efficient vectorized implementations of inference algorithms for structured distributions like alignments, taggings, trees, and spanning trees. This allows users to easily build differentiable models in JAX that explicitly represent structure in data. SynJax provides a unified interface to distributions over different types of structures like sequences, trees, and graphs. Based on a few simple parameters indicating the type of structure, SynJax will automatically select and use the most efficient specialized algorithm for computing quantities like partition functions, marginal probabilities, most likely structures, and samples. SynJax requires minimal code and outperforms alternatives like TorchStruct. This provides an easy way for researchers to build and train large-scale structured models using hardware acceleration, encouraging more work on structured deep learning alternatives to autoregressive models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper presents SynJax, a library for structured probability distributions in JAX. The key method used is automatic differentiation of the algorithms for computing the partition function and marginals in order to efficiently implement inference for various structure types like sequences, trees, and graphs. Specifically, the authors leverage automatic differentiation of the log-partition function, which gives the normalization constant, to derive quantities like marginals, MAP structure, and entropy. This avoids having to implement specialized algorithms for each inference task. The algorithms adapted for automatic differentiation include forward-backward for sequences, inside-outside for trees, and matrix-tree theorem for graphs. By implementing these algorithms efficiently in JAX, SynJax enables large-scale differentiable modeling with explicit structure representations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper introduces SynJax, a new library for JAX that provides efficient implementations of structured probability distributions. The key problems and questions addressed are:- Deep learning libraries like JAX have enabled great progress, but mostly for models like Transformers whose primitives easily map to vectorized computation. Models that explicitly represent structure like trees or segmentations have not benefited as much due to needing custom algorithms not easily vectorized. - Modeling structure explicitly could help generalization, incorporate problem-specific algorithms/constraints, improve interpretability, and discover latent structure. But large-scale structured modeling is hindered by lack of easy-to-use libraries with efficient structured components.- Exact inference for structured distributions requires specialized algorithms for each structure type. Implementing these algorithms is difficult and tedious.- SynJax provides easy-to-use structured probability distributions for JAX that abstract away these algorithmic details. It includes efficient implementations of distributions over alignments, trees, segmentations, etc.- This enables large-scale differentiable modeling with explicit structure representation. Users can focus on modeling while SynJax handles inference algorithms and optimization.In summary, the key problems are: current libraries don't support efficient structured modeling well, explicit structure could help many models, but implementing the needed algorithms is difficult. SynJax aims to address these issues by providing easy-to-use structured probability distributions for JAX.
