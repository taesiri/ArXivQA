# [SynJax: Structured Probability Distributions for JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to facilitate building large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model structure in data. Specifically, the paper introduces SynJax, a library for JAX that provides efficient vectorized implementations of various structured probability distributions and their associated inference algorithms. The goal is to make it easy for users to incorporate structured modeling components like trees and alignments into their JAX models without having to implement custom inference algorithms themselves. The paper argues that while libraries like JAX have enabled progress in deep learning for models like Transformers, structured probability models have lagged behind due to the lack of libraries providing efficient structured components. SynJax aims to fill this gap.So in summary, the main research question is: How can we enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to make structured modeling more accessible and scalable? SynJax provides a solution to this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing SynJax, a library for structured probability distributions in JAX. Specifically:- SynJax provides efficient vectorized implementations of inference algorithms for structured distributions like sequences, alignments, trees, and spanning trees. This enables building large-scale differentiable models in JAX that explicitly capture structure in data.- SynJax offers a unified interface for specifying structured distributions just by setting a few boolean flags. It handles picking the optimal inference algorithm under the hood based on the distribution constraints. This simplifies modeling and removes the need for users to implement inference algorithms themselves. - SynJax supports computing various inference quantities like sampling, finding the most probable structure, marginal probabilities, entropy, etc. It does this by using automatic differentiation on the implementations of partition functions.- SynJax includes distributions and algorithms not found in other JAX libraries for probabilistic modeling. It also benchmarks faster than comparable libraries like Torch-Struct.- SynJax is designed to be easy to use - it is compatible with JAX transformations like vmap, uses Jaxtyping for documentation and type checking, and builds on top of other JAX libraries.In summary, SynJax makes it much easier to develop and deploy large scale structured probabilistic models in JAX by providing efficient building blocks and a simple interface. This could enable more research into structured alternatives to auto-regressive models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:SynJax is a new library for JAX that provides efficient vectorized implementations of algorithms for structured probability distributions, enabling large-scale differentiable modeling with explicit structure.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper on SynJax compares to other related research:- Focus on computational efficiency for structured prediction models. This paper emphasizes optimizing the speed and memory usage of algorithms for various types of structured outputs, allowing their use in large-scale deep learning models. Other work has focused more on modeling capabilities or algorithm correctness.- Implementation in JAX. SynJax is designed specifically for JAX and hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Other libraries like Torch-Struct target PyTorch. There are tradeoffs between frameworks, but JAX optimization can provide significant speedups.- Unified interface for many structure types. SynJax supports distributions over alignments, trees, segmentations, etc. with a simple unified API. Most other libraries specialize in one structure family. This provides modeling flexibility.- Leverages automatic differentiation for inference. By using autodiff for computing partition functions, marginals, etc., SynJax avoids reimplementing specialized algorithms. This is an elegant approach enabled by JAX.- Addition of non-projective spanning trees. Previous libraries lacked support for unrestricted non-projective spanning trees. SynJax fills this gap with efficient implementations.- Focus on deep structured models. Many earlier papers on structured prediction focused on standalone models. By integrating with JAX, SynJax allows combining neural networks with statistical structured models.Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in structured prediction for deep learning in terms of efficiency, scope of structures supported, simplicity of use, and integration with modern ML frameworks. It opens up new modeling capabilities compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest the following future research directions:- Optimizing the algorithms further for speed and memory usage, for example by implementing custom kernels with Pallas or utilizing hardware acceleration like Tensor Cores.- Exploring alternatives to auto-regressive modeling of structured data, now that SynJax makes it easier to experiment with structured models.- Using SynJax to build large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model structure in data.- Finding ways to incorporate problem-specific algorithms and constraints into neural models using the structures provided by SynJax.- Using discrete structures enabled by SynJax for better generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability.- Discovering hidden structures explaining data by modeling them explicitly.So in summary, the main future directions are around using SynJax to improve neural structured modeling research, especially non-auto-regressive methods, as well as optimizing SynJax further. The authors frame SynJax as helping to advance research into structured modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces SynJax, a new library for JAX that enables efficient and easy implementation of structured probability models.
