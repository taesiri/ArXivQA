# [SynJax: Structured Probability Distributions for JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to facilitate building large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model structure in data. Specifically, the paper introduces SynJax, a library for JAX that provides efficient vectorized implementations of various structured probability distributions and their associated inference algorithms. The goal is to make it easy for users to incorporate structured modeling components like trees and alignments into their JAX models without having to implement custom inference algorithms themselves. The paper argues that while libraries like JAX have enabled progress in deep learning for models like Transformers, structured probability models have lagged behind due to the lack of libraries providing efficient structured components. SynJax aims to fill this gap.So in summary, the main research question is: How can we enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to make structured modeling more accessible and scalable? SynJax provides a solution to this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing SynJax, a library for structured probability distributions in JAX. Specifically:- SynJax provides efficient vectorized implementations of inference algorithms for structured distributions like sequences, alignments, trees, and spanning trees. This enables building large-scale differentiable models in JAX that explicitly capture structure in data.- SynJax offers a unified interface for specifying structured distributions just by setting a few boolean flags. It handles picking the optimal inference algorithm under the hood based on the distribution constraints. This simplifies modeling and removes the need for users to implement inference algorithms themselves. - SynJax supports computing various inference quantities like sampling, finding the most probable structure, marginal probabilities, entropy, etc. It does this by using automatic differentiation on the implementations of partition functions.- SynJax includes distributions and algorithms not found in other JAX libraries for probabilistic modeling. It also benchmarks faster than comparable libraries like Torch-Struct.- SynJax is designed to be easy to use - it is compatible with JAX transformations like vmap, uses Jaxtyping for documentation and type checking, and builds on top of other JAX libraries.In summary, SynJax makes it much easier to develop and deploy large scale structured probabilistic models in JAX by providing efficient building blocks and a simple interface. This could enable more research into structured alternatives to auto-regressive models.
