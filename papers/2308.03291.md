# [SynJax: Structured Probability Distributions for JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to facilitate building large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model structure in data. Specifically, the paper introduces SynJax, a library for JAX that provides efficient vectorized implementations of various structured probability distributions and their associated inference algorithms. The goal is to make it easy for users to incorporate structured modeling components like trees and alignments into their JAX models without having to implement custom inference algorithms themselves. The paper argues that while libraries like JAX have enabled progress in deep learning for models like Transformers, structured probability models have lagged behind due to the lack of libraries providing efficient structured components. SynJax aims to fill this gap.So in summary, the main research question is: How can we enable efficient structured probability distributions in JAX to make structured modeling more accessible and scalable? SynJax provides a solution to this problem.
