# [STARFlow: Spatial Temporal Feature Re-embedding with Attentive Learning   for Real-world Scene Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Contemporary scene flow methods face three major challenges - (1) Flow estimation solely based on local receptive fields lacks long-dependency matching of point pairs. (2) There are deformations in non-rigid objects after warping, leading to variations in the spatiotemporal relation between consecutive frames. (3) Previous methods have poor generalization due to significant domain gaps between synthesized and real-world LiDAR-scanned datasets.

Proposed Solution: 
1) A Global Attentive (GA) module is proposed to match all point pairs globally in both feature space and Euclidean space before local refinement, enabling accurate flow initialization. 
2) A Spatial Temporal Feature Re-embedding (STR) module re-embeds temporal features between warped source and target frames, along with spatial features within warped source frame to tackle deformations after warping.  
3) Novel Domain Adaptive (DA) losses are introduced based on local rigidity of objects and cross-frame feature similarity after motion to bridge synthetic-to-real domain gap.

Main Contributions:
1) The GA module leverages transformer-based global attentive mechanism to initialize scene flow, enabling precise long-range matching.
2) The STR module effectively handles spatiotemporal variations after warping by re-embedding deformed surface features.  
3) The DA losses allow strong generalization ability across synthetic and real-world datasets with different patterns.
4) Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across various datasets. The model also exhibits real-time capability and acceptable parameter size.

In summary, the paper proposes a global-to-local scene flow approach using attentive matching and adaptive losses to address contemporary challenges, achieving improved accuracy and generalization.
