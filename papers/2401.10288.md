# [CLAN: A Contrastive Learning based Novelty Detection Framework for Human   Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Human activity recognition (HAR) systems primarily focus on recognizing predefined activities and fail to detect new/emerging activity patterns. However, it's crucial for HAR systems to adapt to new activities in dynamic real-world environments. 
- Existing novelty detection methods are designed for detecting outliers in time series but struggle with complexity of human activities and temporal dynamics. 
- Vision techniques show promise for novelty detection using contrastive learning to derive invariant representations. But they don't address challenges of temporal/frequency properties, activity dynamics, feature overlap between activities, and sensor variations in time series sensor data.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes CLAN, a novelty detection framework using two-tower contrastive learning to handle aforementioned challenges in sensor-based HAR.

- Has a data augmentation selector that determines methods to generate strongly shifted negatives based on temporal/frequency properties of each dataset.

- Employs a multi-negative contrastive loss that adapts to numbers of shifted samples and classification loss for representation learning. Extracts invariant features against meaningless dynamics.

- Uses two towers targeting time and frequency domains to mutually enhance expressiveness in distinguishing between activities even with shared features.

- Score function for novelty detection assessed similarity to learned representations and likelihood of belonging to known activities.

Main Contributions:  
- First framework detecting novelties via contrastive learning in ambient assisted living environments.

- Data augmentation selector automatically selecting methods tailored to dataset properties for generating effective negatives.

- Multi-negative contrastive learning approach specifically designed for learning invariance amidst activity dynamics.  

- Demonstrated superior performance over 7 state-of-the-art approaches on 4 real-world HAR datasets. Enhanced metrics by 8-54% margins.

- Showcased ability to distinguish between known and new activities even with feature overlap through multi-faceted analysis. 

- Established practical applicability via robustness to limited data and 4X faster inference times.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

CLAN is a novel two-tower contrastive learning framework for detecting new activities in time series sensor data by learning invariant representations of known activities and distinguishing them from novel patterns using diverse data augmentation and multi-faceted analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes CLAN, a novel framework for detecting new activities in human activity recognition (HAR) using sensor-based time series data. The main contributions are:

1) It is the first framework to apply contrastive learning for novelty detection in ambient assisted living environments using sensor-based time series data. 

2) It has a classification-based selector to automatically determine suitable data augmentation methods to generate strong positives and negatives tailored to each time series dataset.

3) It employs a two-tower model to extract temporal and frequency representations of the data, which enhances the ability to distinguish between known and new activities. 

4) Extensive experiments on four real-world HAR datasets demonstrate that CLAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection in an unsupervised setting. The ablation studies also highlight the efficacy of each proposed component.

In summary, the main contribution is a new self-supervised contrastive learning-based framework called CLAN that pushes the state-of-the-art in novelty detection for human activity recognition using sensor-based time series data. It offers improved performance and new insights into representation learning and data augmentation for this application area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Novelty detection - The main focus of the paper is on detecting new/novel activities that were not seen during training. This concept of novelty detection is central. 

- Contrastive learning - The paper proposes using contrastive learning techniques to learn invariant representations that can distinguish between known and new activities. This involves attracting positive pairs and pushing away negative pairs.

- Time series sensor data - The paper focuses specifically on novelty detection in time series sensor data related to human activities, as opposed to more common image data. It discusses the unique properties and challenges of this modality.

- Temporal dynamics - The paper emphasizes the complex temporal dynamics inherent in human activity data and discusses the need to derive robust representations invariant to unimportant variations.

- Frequency domain - Analyzing time series data in the frequency domain to capture sensor occurrence patterns is highlighted as an important complementary perspective. 

- Data augmentation - Data augmentation techniques are selectively employed to generate both positive and negative samples for contrastive learning in a way tailored to time series properties.

- Multi-faceted analysis - The proposed two-tower model performs analysis along both time and frequency axes to create multiple distinct representations to better distinguish activities.

In summary, the key themes have to do with using contrastive learning in clever ways for novelty detection in human activity time series sensor data by accounting for the data's unique properties.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions employing a classification-based selector to automatically determine appropriate data augmentation techniques. Could you elaborate on the exact mechanism used to gauge the degree of shift from the original data when applying different augmentation methods? What specific classifications tasks or objectives are set up?

2. When constructing the contrastive loss function to adapt to multiple augmented samples, the paper refers to comparing an original sample $x$ with its positive $\Tilde{x}$ and various negatives $x_{(j)}$. Could you explain the rationale behind using the same augmentation method rather than different methods for generating the positive sample? 

3. The paper discusses applying both contrastive learning and an auxiliary classification task during representation learning. What is the motivation behind using this dual objective approach? What unique benefits does each objective provide in learning robust activity representations?

4. The time and frequency encoders focus on different facets of the sensor data, but both utilize identical network architectures. What is the basis for the choice of network architecture? Does using the same architecture provide any advantages when combining the learned time and frequency representations?

5. The paper introduces two types of score functions, one based on contrastive learning representations and another based on classification representations. Why have two separate scoring mechanisms been set up this way? When would you expect one to perform better than the other?

6. One of the datasets used contains over 240 different sensor types. How does the method handle or process such a large variety of sensor inputs? Are there any changes you would suggest to improve multi-modal sensor handling?

7. The evaluation involves both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations. What key additional insights do the visual analysis methods provide? What limitations exist in only using numerical performance metrics?  

8. How does the method address potential privacy concerns that may arise from using human activity data collected from private spaces like homes? Does the unsupervised learning approach provide any advantages related to privacy?

9. The paper demonstrates testing under different training data sizes. Under what real-world circumstances could you expect to have limited data? How does reduced data impact which components of the method?

10. The method seems to involve several key parameters that require tuning, such as the threshold $\theta_{ST}$ or temperature $\tau$. Does the optimal parameter configuration vary significantly across datasets? How can the guide the parameter selection process for new datasets?
