# [Leeroo Orchestrator: Elevating LLMs Performance Through Model   Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing large language models (LLMs) requires extensive compute and data, making further gains increasingly costly. An alternative is to leverage combinations of smaller, specialized models. 
- Selecting the optimal model for each input among hundreds of thousands of LLMs poses a challenge. 
- Existing mixture-of-experts approaches have scalability issues in the number of experts.

Proposed Solution:
- A Leeroo Orchestrator architecture to intelligently route inputs to the most suitable LLM expert based on performance, cost, and other criteria.
- Uses a policy network trained via a self-play loop to learn expert selection. 
- Employs a universe constructor to pick a complementary set of experts.
- New experts can be continuously added and evaluated.

Key Contributions:
- Leeroo Orchestrator reaches 75.9% accuracy on MMLU benchmark, outperforming top open-source model Mixtral by over 5% at the same cost.
- Matches GPT3.5 performance at 73% lower cost. 
- Leeroo variant with GPT4 expert nearly matches GPT4 accuracy at 50% lower cost.
- Shows promise of specialized, cost-efficient model combinations exceeding large monolithic LLMs. 
- Framework facilitates ongoing enhancement as new expert models emerge.
- Demonstrates route toward economical, customizable state-of-the-art LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an orchestrator architecture that intelligently selects the most suitable expert LLM from a pool of models for each input, optimizing for performance, cost, and other criteria, and shows through evaluation on the MMLU benchmark that this approach can match or exceed state-of-the-art performance at lower cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an architecture called the Leeroo Orchestrator to intelligently select the most suitable LLM expert model for each input query while considering optimization criteria such as cost, speed, and accuracy. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing the Leeroo Orchestrator architecture that contains a policy network to pick the best LLM expert for each query based on the remaining budget and predicted performance.

- Introducing a Universe Constructor module to select a complementary set of expert models that provides maximal coverage and performance across queries. 

- Presenting a self-play loop methodology to generate training data for the Leeroo Orchestrator by evaluating expert model responses.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the MMLU benchmark by the Leeroo Orchestrator while reducing the computational cost compared to models like GPT-3.5 and Mixtral.

So in summary, the main innovation is the Leeroo Orchestrator architecture that can optimize selection and usage of multiple LLM experts to improve performance in a cost-effective manner.
