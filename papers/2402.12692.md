# [FormulaQA: A Question Answering Dataset for Formula-Based Numerical   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12692)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing numerical reasoning datasets rely on implicit commonsense knowledge and don't require explicit formulas to guide reasoning. This makes them limited for evaluating complex real-world problems.
- Recently introduced formula-based datasets only have formulas for 33-38% of questions and use simple commonsense formulas.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a new formula-based question answering dataset called FormulaQA from Chinese junior high school physics exams.
- Annotate each question with reasoning steps, formulas (structure, symbols, values, units), and final answer using both manual work and assistance from large language models (LLMs).
- Build a formula database by merging semantically similar formulas that can serve as an external knowledge base.
- Evaluate performance of LLMs ranging from 7B to over 100B parameters using zero-shot and few-shot chain of thoughts prompting.
- Also evaluate fine-tuned smaller models and retrieval-augmented LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce FormulaQA, a complex formula-driven numerical reasoning dataset requiring multi-step reasoning.
- Comprehensive annotations include reasoning chains and formula database.
- Establish strong baselines with state-of-the-art models, showing significant room for improvement.
- FormulaQA pushes progress on incorporating domain-specific formulas into numerical reasoning.

In summary, the paper presents FormulaQA, a new challenging dataset aiming to advance numerical reasoning research by requiring reasoning guided by formal domain-specific formulas instead of just commonsense knowledge. Thorough experiments underscore poor performance of current methods, motivating future efforts.
