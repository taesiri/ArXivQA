# [Understanding In-Context Learning via Supportive Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15091)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: What pretraining data is particularly supportive for developing the in-context learning abilities of large language models?The authors hypothesize that there may exist a small subset of the pretraining data that is especially helpful for promoting strong in-context learning performance on downstream tasks. They aim to identify and analyze such data in order to better understand where models acquire the intriguing in-context learning abilities from.Specifically, some key points about the research question and hypothesis:- The focus is on understanding in-context learning (ICL) abilities, where models are given example demonstrations at inference time rather than being trained or finetuned. - The approach is analyzing the pretraining data itself rather than just the models or inference processes.- The hypothesis is that there may be certain supportive instances within the pretraining data that contribute disproportionately to ICL abilities.- The goal is to find and characterize these hypothesized supportive examples to shed light on how pretraining drives emergent ICL capacities.So in summary, the central research question revolves around identifying and analyzing the subset of pretraining data most supportive for in-context learning in order to better understand the origins of this surprising capability in large language models.
