# [Towards a unified view of unsupervised non-local methods for image   denoising: the NL-Ridge approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of image denoising, which is removing noise from images corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. Image denoising is a fundamental problem in image processing. The paper focuses specifically on non-local patch-based methods that exploit self-similarity of patches within an image. 

Prior Work:
The paper discusses several major prior non-local methods for image denoising:
- NL-means: Averaging similar patches across the image, weighted by patch similarity
- BM3D: Grouping similar patches, collaborative filtering using 3D transform domain sparsity 
- NL-Bayes: Bayesian modeling of patch groups 

These methods follow a two-step approach but were derived under different modeling and estimation frameworks.

Proposed Method: 
The paper proposes a unified framework called NL-Ridge to interpret and connect these previous non-local methods. The key ideas are:

1) Model the denoiser as a weighted linear combination of similar patches. Weights are learned in a data-driven way.

2) Use Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) in the first step to get an initial estimate of the optimal weights.

3) Improve weights in a second step using "internal adaptation", leveraging the initially denoised image. This gives a closed-form solution using multivariate Ridge regression.

By considering different forms of the patch aggregator, the paper shows NL-Ridge can reproduce BM3D and NL-Bayes under this unified view.

The resulting NL-Ridge algorithm is simple, fast, unsupervised, and achieves state-of-the-art image denoising performance. It outperforms traditional methods like BM3D and NL-Bayes as well as recent unsupervised deep learning techniques.

Main Contributions:
- A unified framework (NL-Ridge) to interpret and connect several non-local patch-based image denoisers
- New state-of-the-art results for unsupervised image denoising 
- Conceptually simpler algorithm than complex BM3D or deep learning methods
- Reconciles modeling-based and data-driven approaches for image denoising
