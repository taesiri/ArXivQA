# [Improving Language Plasticity via Pretraining with Active Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can incorporating an active forgetting mechanism during pretraining improve the language plasticity of pretrained language models, allowing them to more efficiently adapt to new languages, especially in low-data regimes?The key hypothesis is that by resetting the embedding layer periodically during pretraining, the model will be forced to repeatedly relearn good token embeddings, making it more adept at quickly learning new embeddings for new languages later on. This is analogous to a meta-learning process. The authors propose a simple "active forgetting" method where they reset the token embeddings (but not the rest of the model) every K updates during pretraining. They compare models pretrained this way ("forgetting PLMs") to standard pretrained models without forgetting.The main research questions they aim to answer are:1) Can forgetting PLMs learn new languages better with limited adaptation data? (RQ1)2) Do forgetting PLMs converge faster when adapting to new languages? (RQ2) 3) Does the similarity between the new language and English impact the benefits of forgetting? (RQ3)So in summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating active forgetting during pretraining will improve language plasticity, enabling more efficient adaptation to new languages later, especially in low-resource scenarios. The key research questions focus on sample efficiency, convergence speed, and effects on dissimilar languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel "active forgetting" mechanism during pretraining of language models, which helps create PLMs (pretrained language models) that can quickly adapt to new languages, especially low-resource languages. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Incorporating an active forgetting mechanism during pretraining, where the embedding layer is periodically reset while the rest of the model is kept unchanged. - This "forgetting pretraining" encourages the PLM to improve its ability to rapidly learn new embeddings within a limited number of updates.- Experiments with RoBERTA show models pretrained this way not only converge faster during language adaptation, but also outperform standard pretrained models in low-resource scenarios and for distant languages.So in summary, the main contribution is introducing a simple yet effective "active forgetting" technique during pretraining to improve language plasticity and enable efficient adaptation of PLMs to new languages, especially low-resource and distant languages. The forgetting mechanism seems to have a meta-learning effect, making the PLMs more robust and quick to learn new token embeddings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the LaTeX code provided, I cannot fully assess the content of the paper or compare it to other research, since the code only contains formatting information and section headings. However, here are a few observations about what can be gleaned from the provided LaTeX code:- The paper seems to be a conference submission for NeurIPS 2023, as indicated by the \documentclass command loading the neurips_2023 style file. This suggests the research is likely in the field of machine learning or artificial intelligence.- The \author field indicates the authors are from various AI-related organizations and universities, including UCL, Meta, Reka AI, and Cohere AI. - The abstract mentions improving language plasticity via pretraining with active forgetting. This suggests the paper relates to natural language processing, specifically looking at techniques to make pretrained language models more adaptable to new languages or domains.- The \newcommand definitions include a lot of notation for vectors, matrices, distributions, etc., implying the paper involves mathematical and statistical formalism.- Packages like algorithm, algorithmic, and subcaption are loaded, suggesting the paper contains algorithms and figures with subcaptions.Without seeing the actual paper content, it's difficult to compare this work directly to other research. But based on the preprocessing and adaptation focus for language models, it seems related to techniques like adapter tuning, continual learning, and meta-learning that aim to improve model plasticity. Comparing this approach of active forgetting during pretraining to these other methods would require examining the actual approach and results described in the paper. The LaTeX code alone provides some hints about the field and nature of the work, but does not allow a substantive comparison.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring more advanced forms of forgetting, such as gradually injecting noise into the embedding weights rather than completely resetting them.- Applying the active forgetting mechanism to other model architectures besides masked language modeling with language-specific tokenizers, such as auto-regressive models like GPT and different tokenization strategies.- Establishing theoretical connections between the forgetting approach and meta-learning, to better understand why active forgetting during pretraining helps models quickly adapt to new tasks and languages. - Analyzing the loss landscape and flatness of minima for the transformer body during forgetting pretraining, to potentially explain why this approach works well. Flatter minima may relate to better generalization.- Extending the forgetting approach beyond language adaptation tasks to other scenarios where model plasticity is beneficial, such as quickly adapting to new tasks, domains, and non-stationary environments.- Combining active forgetting with adapter-based methods by allowing forgetting in the adapter layers, to retain model architecture while improving adaptability.- Generalizing the idea of creating easily "rewirable" PLMs to make their knowledge more controllable and modifiable, similar to symbolic knowledge methods. This could complement other model editing techniques.In summary, the authors point to several promising research directions around understanding, improving, and extending the forgetting mechanism, as well as applying it more broadly to increase model plasticity and controllability in various settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a method to improve the language plasticity of pretrained language models (PLMs) by incorporating active forgetting during pretraining. Specifically, they periodically reset the token embedding layer of the PLM during pretraining while keeping other parameters fixed. This exposes the model to forgetting and forces it to quickly relearn the embeddings, simulating adaptation to new languages. They hypothesize this makes the PLM more robust and able to quickly adapt to new languages during finetuning by only updating the embedding layer. Experiments on a RoBERTa model show models pretrained with active forgetting (forgetting PLMs) outperform standard pretrained models in low-resource cross-lingual transfer tasks, especially for distant languages. Forgetting PLMs also converge much faster when adapting to new languages. The results demonstrate pretraining with active forgetting improves model plasticity and efficiency in adapting PLMs to new languages.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a simple method to improve the ability of pretrained language models (PLMs) to quickly adapt to new languages. The key idea is to incorporate "active forgetting" into the pretraining process. Specifically, the token embedding layer of the PLM is periodically reset during pretraining, while the rest of the model parameters remain unchanged. This forces the model to repeatedly relearn good token embeddings, making it more robust to different embedding initializations. According to the authors, this results in a meta-learning effect that enhances the model's ability to efficiently learn embeddings for new languages. The proposed method is evaluated by adapting a pretrained RoBERTa model to a diverse set of languages using limited unlabeled data. Experiments across several cross-lingual transfer tasks show that "forgetting PLMs" significantly outperform standard PLMs, especially for low-resource languages that are distant from English. The forgetting models also demonstrate much faster convergence when adapting to new languages. Overall, the results indicate that incorporating active forgetting into pretraining can improve model rewirability and language plasticity. This has implications for efficiently extending PLMs to many languages and continually adapting them as languages evolve over time.
