# [Large Language Models as an Indirect Reasoner: Contrapositive and   Contradiction for Automated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) mainly follow direct reasoning (DR) frameworks. However, many real-world problems are difficult or even impossible to solve via direct reasoning. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative reasoning strategies to overcome the limitations of direct reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel indirect reasoning (IR) method to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs. The key idea is to utilize the logical equivalences of contrapositive and contradiction to transform problems into an alternate form that is more amenable for reasoning by LLMs. 

The method involves two main stages:
1) Rule Augmentation: Using the equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive, augment the rule set to enhance comprehensibility of rules for LLM.
2) Indirect Reasoning: Guide LLM to conduct reasoning based on proof by contradiction, which is logically equivalent to the original direct reasoning process. Custom prompt templates are designed to stimulate the LLM to implement indirect reasoning.

The proposed IR method can be easily combined with existing DR methods to create a DIR framework that unifies both direct and indirect reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce indirect reasoning strategies of contrapositive and contradiction to enhance reasoning abilities of LLMs
- Devises prompt templates to effectively guide LLMs to implement indirect reasoning
- Achieves significant accuracy improvements over direct reasoning baselines on factual reasoning (27.33%) and math proof tasks (31.43%)
- Establishes DIR framework that unifies direct and indirect reasoning, outperforming either alone

The proposed techniques are model-agnostic, simple to implement and can expand the scope of problems that can be tackled by LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an indirect reasoning method using contrapositives and contradictions to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces the principle of indirect reasoning based on the equivalence of logic, including contrapositive and contradiction, into the reasoning process of large language models (LLMs).

2. It devises a series of prompt templates that effectively stimulate LLMs to implement indirect reasoning. The method utilizes the principles of contrapositive and contradiction during the data preprocessing and indirect reasoning process. 

3. Experimental results show that the proposed indirect reasoning method performs significantly better than existing direct reasoning methods in many problems that direct reasoning methods cannot work well. 

4. It shows that combining the proposed indirect reasoning with existing direct reasoning strategies can further improve the reasoning ability of LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an indirect reasoning method via tailored prompts to enhance the reasoning power of LLMs, which can well compensate for problems that are not directly derivable from known conditions and rules. The effectiveness is validated through experiments on factual reasoning and mathematic proof tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using contrapositive and contradiction for indirect reasoning with LLMs. What are some other logical equivalences that could be leveraged to further enhance indirect reasoning capabilities?

2. The rule augmentation technique shows promise for improving reasoning. What are some ideas to make this augmentation more robust and less prone to errors? 

3. The paper combines direct and indirect reasoning with a simple voting scheme. What are some more sophisticated aggregation methods that could be explored? How might they improve performance?

4. The indirect reasoning templates are designed specifically for contradiction and contrapositive logic. How might these be generalized to incorporate other types of indirect reasoning?

5. The paper shows reduced reasoning steps with indirect reasoning on some tasks. Is there an analysis that can predict when indirect vs direct reasoning will require fewer steps? 

6. How does the performance of indirect reasoning compare when using different decoding strategies like beam search vs sampling? What adjustments need to be made to the method?

7. What modifications need to be made to adopt this approach for multi-hop reasoning tasks which require combining multiple facts and rules?

8. How can the reliability and correctness of the reasoning process itself be evaluated beyond just answer accuracy? What metrics can be used?

9. For real-world deployment, what are some failure modes and error cases that need to be studied when using this approach? How can the method be made more robust? 

10. The method relies on human-designed prompt templates. How can the prompts be learned automatically from data in an end-to-end manner so less human involvement is needed?
