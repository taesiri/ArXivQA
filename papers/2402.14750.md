# [Testing Spacecraft Formation Flying with Crazyflie Drones as Satellite   Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Testing spacecraft autonomy algorithms on-orbit can be prohibitively expensive and high risk. An alternative approach is to test these algorithms terrestrially using satellite surrogates, but most existing testbeds are limited to simulating attitude dynamics rather than full translational motion. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes using Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.1 micro-quadcopters as an inexpensive surrogate platform for visualizing and evaluating autonomous spacecraft translational dynamics and control algorithms. The open-source Crazyflies are modeled in the PyBullet-based gym-pybullet-drones simulation environment. Linearized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations governing spacecraft relative motion are solved to generate waypoint trajectories, which are then scaled and followed by the Crazyflies under PID control in simulation. Additionally, neural network controllers trained with reinforcement learning are used to generate docking trajectories, which are also formatted for the Crazyflies to follow.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates feasibility of using inexpensive, open-source Crazyflie drones as surrogate testbeds for spacecraft autonomy algorithms requiring full translational motion
- Implements spacecraft relative motion models and dynamics equations to generate waypoint trajectories for natural motion and docking scenarios
- Scales spacecraft trajectories for Crazyflies to follow in simulation under PID control
- Tests following trajectories generated by reinforcement learning-based neural network controllers trained for on-orbit docking

The low cost and availability of the Crazyflie platform enables scalable testing of autonomous spacecraft control algorithms on multi-vehicle testbeds. Performance of autonomy behaviors like rendezvous, docking and proximity operations can be easily visualized. This approach facilitates rapid design iteration, evaluation and safe testing of spacecraft autonomy prior to expensive on-orbit implementation.
