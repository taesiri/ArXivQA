# [Attribute-preserving Face Dataset Anonymization via Latent Code   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11296)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to anonymize the identity of faces in image datasets while preserving the facial attributes. 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a method to anonymize face images that obfuscates identity while retaining facial attributes like pose, expression, etc. This allows using the anonymized images for downstream tasks like training ML models.

- Existing methods either require training extra networks or fail to preserve facial attributes. 

- The proposed method works by directly optimizing the latent code of a pre-trained GAN to generate anonymized images. 

- Two novel losses are used - an identity loss to push the anonymized face away from the original identity, and an attribute loss to retain facial attributes.

- Experiments show the method anonymizes identity comparably to state-of-the-art while better preserving attributes.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that directly optimizing the latent code of a pre-trained GAN with explicit losses to obfuscate identity and retain attributes can generate high-quality anonymized face datasets useful for downstream tasks. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
