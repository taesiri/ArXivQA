# [Diffusion Sampling with Momentum for Mitigating Divergence Artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11118)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we mitigate the divergence artifacts that can occur when using high-order numerical methods with few sampling steps for diffusion model image generation?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

Incorporating momentum techniques inspired by optimization methods into existing high-order diffusion sampling solvers can help enlarge their stability regions. This will reduce the likelihood of divergence artifacts when using these solvers with aggressive step sizes.

Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates two techniques:

1) Applying Polyak's Heavy Ball momentum to existing solvers like DPM-Solver++ and PLMS. 

2) Developing a new family of solvers called Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB) that offer a tunable trade-off between accuracy and divergence artifact suppression.

The central premise is that by adapting these momentum techniques, the stability properties of the solvers can be improved, enabling low-step sampling while avoiding visual artifacts. The experiments aim to demonstrate that these techniques successfully reduce artifacts and improve image quality compared to prior state-of-the-art diffusion sampling algorithms.

In summary, the core research contribution is a stability-focused perspective on diffusion sampler design, along with novel momentum-based techniques to expand the stable operating range of solvers to match the needs of few-step generation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in diffusion model sampling:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing momentum techniques to stabilize and accelerate sampling from diffusion models. Using momentum in diffusion sampling is a relatively new idea that has not been extensively explored before. Most prior work has focused on developing new numerical solvers, noise schedules, or model architectures. 

- This paper is the first to analyze the connection between numerical instability/divergence artifacts and the stability region of ODE solvers. This provides new theoretical insights into the causes of artifacts. Previous papers have observed these artifacts but not provided as concrete of an explanation.

- The proposed HB and GHVB momentum techniques seem competitive or superior to other recent methods like DEIS, DPM-Solver, PLMS, etc. in terms of sample quality and acceleration. The paper shows strong empirical results on both pixel and latent diffusion models.

- The GHVB method is novel as the first momentum technique that maintains high order of convergence. Other momentum variants like HB reduce the order to 1st order. GHVB elegantly combines the benefits of momentum and accuracy.

- The techniques require minimal changes to existing codebases and no retraining, making them easy to integrate. Other methods like distillation or noise scheduling require extensive training.

Overall, this paper makes excellent theoretical and empirical contributions to understanding and accelerating diffusion sampling. The momentum techniques are simple yet powerful ideas validated through extensive experiments. This work moves the field forward on an important problem and provides a strong baseline for future research to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating other momentum-based techniques besides Polyak's heavy ball momentum to improve stability and reduce artifacts, such as Nesterov momentum or aggregated momentum. The paper briefly touches on these methods but does not explore them in depth. Comparing different momentum techniques could reveal new insights.

- Generalizing the proposed techniques to the SDE formulation of diffusion models. The current work focuses on the ODE formulation, but extending it to SDEs could broaden the applicability.

- Applying the proposed techniques to other sampling methods besides numerical ODE/SDE solvers, such as Langevin dynamics-based samplers. This could potentially improve their stability as well.

- Further analysis and techniques to balance solution accuracy and stability region size when using high-order solvers. The trade-off between these factors requires more investigation.

- Extending the work to video generation models and 3D diffusion models, where stability and artifacts are also major concerns.

- Developing adaptive methods that can automatically adjust momentum and related parameters based on metrics to detect potential artifacts during sampling.

- Further exploration into the causes and dynamics of divergence artifacts beyond just eigenvalues and stability regions. There may be other factors at play.

In summary, the authors propose further work on expanding and generalizing their momentum techniques, applying them to other formulations and models, balancing accuracy and stability, and deepening the understanding of diffusion sampling artifacts. Overall, it opens up many avenues for improving diffusion model sampling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a diffusion model for text-to-image generation. It proposes two main techniques to improve the sampling process and reduce divergence artifacts in generated images. 

First, it incorporates Polyak's heavy ball momentum into existing numerical solvers like DPM-Solver++ and PLMS to expand their stability regions and reduce artifacts. This is shown to be effective but reduces the order of convergence to 1. 

Second, it proposes a novel numerical solver called Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB) that offers a variable tradeoff between accuracy and artifact suppression. GHVB generalizes the momentum approach to achieve high-order convergence unlike standard heavy ball methods. 

Experiments on pixel and latent-based diffusion models demonstrate the ability of both techniques to reduce artifacts and improve image quality at low sampling steps. The techniques provide useful insights into designing numerical solvers for diffusion models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes two techniques to reduce divergence artifacts and improve image quality in diffusion sampling methods for generative modeling. Diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding image generation capabilities but can suffer from slow sampling. Although high-order numerical methods can accelerate sampling, they often introduce divergence artifacts when using very few sampling steps. 

The first technique adapts Polyak's heavy ball momentum, commonly used to accelerate optimization, to expand the stability region of existing sampling methods. This reduces artifacts but results in only first-order convergence. The second technique, called generalized heavy ball, constructs new high-order methods with expanded stability regions to provide a flexible trade-off between accuracy and artifact suppression. Experiments on pixel-based and latent-based diffusion models show both techniques effectively reduce artifacts, improve image quality, and achieve state-of-the-art performance for low-step sampling. The novel insights into numerical method design will inform future development of fast, stable diffusion sampling.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes two techniques to mitigate divergence artifacts and improve image quality in diffusion sampling. The first technique incorporates Polyak's Heavy Ball (HB) momentum into existing numerical diffusion sampling methods like DPM-Solver++ and PLMS to expand their stability regions. This reduces artifacts but results in only first-order convergence. The second technique is a new family of high-order numerical methods called Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB) that offer a tunable trade-off between accuracy and artifact suppression via a momentum parameter. GHVB achieves this by calculating the momentum before, rather than after, the summation of high-order coefficient terms when generalizing the HB formulation to higher orders. Experiments on pixel-based and latent-based diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of both techniques in reducing artifacts, especially for low-step sampling, while improving or maintaining image quality. The insights from this work can guide future diffusion sampling method design.
