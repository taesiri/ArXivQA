# [DiffuLT: How to Make Diffusion Model Useful for Long-tail Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05170)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Long-tailed recognition is a challenging and practical problem where some classes have abundant samples (majority) while others have few samples (minority).
- Existing methods typically rely on re-weighting and re-sampling which require meticulous design. Recent methods also use external data to augment tail classes but rely on access to additional data sources.
- The paper raises the key question - can we balance long-tail datasets without depending on external data or models?

Proposed Solution - DiffuLT:  
- A pipeline employing a randomly initialized diffusion model trained only on the original imbalanced dataset to generate samples for tail classes. This results in a more balanced dataset for direct optimization.
- The diffusion model incorporates modifications like conditioning and regularization to enhance sample quality from tail classes. 
- A filtering approach is proposed to remove harmful synthetic samples using metrics leveraging intrinsic dataset information.
- A new classifier is trained on the augmented dataset using weighted cross-entropy loss to reduce impact of synthetic samples.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to tackle long-tail recognition by generating tail samples without external data/models, using simple cross-entropy for classification.
- Detailed analysis revealing diffusion model's role as an information aggregator and distributor in the pipeline. Also shows correlation between diffusion model performance and classification accuracy.
- Extensive experiments validate superiority over existing methods across CIFAR and ImageNet based long-tail datasets. Achieves new state-of-the-art results.
- The complete in-domain generation pipeline demonstrates high generalizability to real-world long-tail scenarios with limited data access.

In summary, the paper introduces DiffuLT, a novel data-centric pipeline for long-tail recognition which generates samples from scratch to balance datasets. Without using external data sources, it shows top performance across benchmarks while offering interpretability.
