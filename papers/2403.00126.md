# [FAC$^2$E: Better Understanding Large Language Model Capabilities by   Dissociating Language and Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) use overall performance metrics on various tasks, failing to provide fine-grained and interpretable understanding of models' capabilities. 
- They lack distinction between language and cognitive capabilities, which are known to be distinct in the human brain.

Proposed Solution - FAC2E Framework
- Defines taxonomy of LLM capabilities into 4 dimensions: Linguistic Knowledge, Formal Knowledge, World Modeling, and Social Modeling. Grounded in neuroscience evidence of separated language and cognition. 
- Unifies existing benchmarks into question-answering format and designs capability-specific instructions. Evaluates via few-shot instruction following.
- Further breaks down each capability into 3 reasoning sub-steps - knowledge recall, knowledge utilization, problem solving. Elicits intermediate steps from models via prompting. 
- Evaluates each sub-step using automatic metrics to provide granular diagnosis of models' strengths and weaknesses.

Key Contributions:
- Novel framework that provides interpretable, fine-grained evaluation of both language and cognitive capabilities of LLMs.
- Analysis reveals gap between open-source and proprietary models, and that language vs. cognitive capabilities are weakly correlated.  
- Proposed knowledge-enhanced method significantly boosts performance, demonstrating limitations in knowledge utilization.
- Overall, enables more comprehensive understanding of model capabilities to better guide further advancements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents FAC2E, a framework for fine-grained and cognition-grounded evaluation of large language models' capabilities by dissociating language and cognitive skills, formulating capabilities into linguistic knowledge, formal knowledge, world modeling, and social modeling, and evaluating performance on knowledge recall, knowledge utilization, and problem-solving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing FAC2E, a fine-grained capability evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) FAC2E dissociates the language-related and cognition-related capabilities of LLMs, and organizes them into four distinct axes: Linguistic Knowledge, Formal Knowledge, World Modeling, and Social Modeling. This categorization is grounded in neuroscience evidence about the separation of language and cognitive processes in the human brain.

2) FAC2E breaks down the evaluation of each capability into three sub-steps - knowledge recall, knowledge utilization, and problem solving - by extracting the intermediate reasoning from the LLM. This allows assessing the quality of knowledge encoded in the model and the effectiveness of applying that knowledge. 

3) FAC2E provides a two-faceted diagnosis of LLMs by evaluating each sub-step of every fine-grained capability. This offers more comprehensive and nuanced understanding compared to a single performance metric.

4) Using FAC2E, the paper identifies a common limitation of knowledge utilization among existing models, and proposes a straightforward knowledge-enhanced method to mitigate this issue. Results showcase promising performance improvements, highlighting a direction for advancing LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of FAC2E, a novel evaluation framework that can reveal deeper insights into LLMs' capabilities in a more fine-grained, interpretable and cognition-grounded manner.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- FAC$^2$E - The name of the proposed framework for fine-grained and cognition-grounded capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs). Stands for "Fine-grained and Cognition-grounded LLMs' Capability Evaluation".

- Dissociating language and cognition - A key idea in the paper is dissociating language-related capabilities from cognition-related capabilities when evaluating LLMs, grounded in evidence from neuroscience.  

- Crystallized performance - Refers to the model's ability to recall and provide relevant knowledge, evaluated in the first sub-step.

- Fluid performance - Refers to the model's ability to effectively utilize the recalled knowledge, evaluated in the second sub-step.  

- Problem-solving performance - The model's final performance in solving the overall task, evaluated in the third sub-step.

- Instruction tuning - Training paradigm for LLMs involving providing demonstrations along with instructions. Models like GPT-3.5 use this.

- Few-shot learning - Method where models are provided a small number of examples/demonstrations and asked to perform a task. Leveraged in FAC$^2$E.

- Knowledge injection - Proposed method to improve model performance by providing additional relevant knowledge text as input.

So in summary, key terms revolve around capability evaluation, differentiating language vs cognition skills, scoring model sub-steps, and techniques like instruction tuning and knowledge injection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does FAC2E effectively dissociate language-related capabilities from cognition-related capabilities? What is the theoretical and empirical basis for making this distinction?

2. The paper categorizes capabilities into 4 dimensions - linguistic knowledge, formal knowledge, world modeling, and social modeling. What are some alternative ways to categorize capabilities that could also provide meaningful insights?

3. The 3 sub-steps of knowledge recall, knowledge utilization, and problem solving are central to FAC2E's evaluation. What are some key challenges in evaluating each of these sub-steps independently? 

4. What types of reference rationales would be most appropriate for accurately evaluating the intermediate reasoning steps? How can high quality rationales be constructed at scale?

5. How sensitive are the results from FAC2E's stepwise evaluation approach to the specific choice of automatic evaluation metrics used for scoring? What metrics seem most promising?

6. In what ways could FAC2E's formulation of language vs cognition capabilities apply to multimodal models that incorporate both text and other modalities? What modifications might be needed?

7. The paper finds stronger intra-dimension than inter-dimension capability correlations. What might explain this finding theoretically? How could this inform architecture design?  

8. How well would FAC2E generalize to evaluating capabilities for domain-specific models vs general purpose models? What adaptations are needed?

9. Could FAC2E reveal socially biased reasoning within models? What protocols could evaluate model performance regarding social biases?

10. Beyond improved accuracy, what kinds of additional insights might annotating datasets at a more fine-grained capability level provide about current models and data?
