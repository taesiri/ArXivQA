# [Explaining Drift using Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models often deteriorate in performance when the distribution of data changes over time (concept drift). 
- There is a need for techniques to identify the root causes behind concept drift to make models more resilient.
- Concept drift can be categorized into "real drift" (change in relationship between inputs and outputs) and "virtual drift" (change in input distribution). Separating out these factors is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called "DBShap" to identify and quantify the contributors to concept drift using Shapley values. 
- It extends the formulation of Shapley values to operate on probability distributions instead of scalar features. 
- This allows measuring the importances of changes in distributions of inputs as well as changes in the input-output mapping.
- Approximations are made to allow practical application to real world data.

Key Contributions:
- Novel application of Shapley values to explain concept drift by attributing drift to changes in input distribution (virtual drift) and input-output relations (real drift).
- Mathematical framework to compute Shapley values for functions over probability distributions. 
- Algorithm called DBShap implementing the proposed ideas with approximations for practical use.
- Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world concept drift datasets demonstrating ability to accurately identify factors causing drift.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in explaining and diagnosing the causes of concept drift in machine learning models by disentangling the effects of change in input distribution vs change in input-output relations using Shapley values.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called DBShap that uses Shapley values to identify and quantify the main contributors, including changes in feature distributions (virtual drift) and functional relationships (real drift), to model drift over different data populations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework called DBShap that uses Shapley values to identify and quantify the main factors driving concept drift (deterioration in model performance when applied to out-of-distribution data). The key ideas are:

1) Extending the formulation of Shapley values to handle distributional inputs instead of scalar features. This allows tracking how changes in input distributions affect the output distribution. 

2) Using the distributional Shapley values to decompose the change in model risk into contributions from changes in the input distribution (virtual drift) and changes in the conditional input-output distribution (real drift).

3) Providing an algorithm to approximately compute the Shapley values and feature importances in real-world applications with concept drift. 

4) Validating the approach on synthetic drift datasets where ground truth is known, as well as real-world concept drift datasets. The method is able to accurately attribute model deterioration to real vs virtual drift.

In summary, the key novelty is a principled explainability framework based on Shapley values to understand the factors driving concept drift, quantifying the contributions of changes in input distribution vs input-output relationship.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Concept drift: The phenomenon where the distribution of data changes over time, leading to deterioration in model performance.

- Virtual drift: Changes in the distribution of the input features, also referred to as sampling shift. 

- Real drift: Changes in the relationship between input features and output, referred to as concept shift.  

- Shapley values: A method from cooperative game theory used to attribute contributions of features to a model's output.

- Baseline Shapley: A variant of Shapley values that measures feature contributions relative to a baseline. 

- Distribution Baseline Shap (\ouralgo): The proposed method that adapts baseline Shapley to handle distributions as inputs in order to explain concept drift.

- Feature importances: The output of \ouralgo that quantifies the contribution of changes in input distributions (virtual drift) and conditional distributions (real drift) to deterioration in model performance.

So in summary, the key terms cover concept drift, its categorization into real/virtual drift, the use of Shapley values for explanation, and the proposed Distribution Baseline Shap method.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel way to compute Shapley values for functions with probability distributions as inputs. Can you explain this formulation and how it allows attributing changes in a function's output to changes in input distributions? 

2. The paper frames concept drift as a change in distribution and decomposes it into real drift (change in P(y|x)) and virtual drift (change in P(x)). How does the proposed Shapley value formulation help quantify the contributions of real vs virtual drift?

3. Algorithm 1 provides approximations to make the proposed framework practical. Can you discuss these approximations and why they are needed? How do they impact the accuracy of the computed Shapley values?

4. The paper evaluates the method on synthetic datasets with known ground truth regarding drift. What specific aspects of the method's outputs are evaluated on these datasets? Why is ground truth needed for this evaluation?

5. For real-world datasets, ground truth is not available. How does the paper evaluate the proposed method on such datasets? What limitations exist in evaluating performance on real-world data?

6. The proposed method attributes concept drift to changes in input distributions and conditional distributions P(y|x). What other potential factors could contribute to concept drift that are not considered by this method?

7. The paper mentions applicability of the method beyond concept drift over time. Can you discuss some other potential applications where explaining differences between populations could be useful?

8. One limitation mentioned is lack of ways to accurately measure importance values from methods like this. What approaches could help evaluate accuracy of attribution methods like the one proposed?

9. How does the proposed method scale computationally with an increase in the number of input features? What drives the computational complexity?

10. The method assumes a factorization of the joint distribution P(x,y). How does choice of factorization impact the attribution to individual features? How can the attribution change for different plausible factorizations?
