# Image Inpainting via Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural   Networks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an effective image inpainting method that can generate both visually plausible global structures and realistic local textures in the inpainted regions. The key points are:- Proposing a generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) architecture to model different image components in parallel for inpainting.- Designing an implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) loss to enhance local texture details by diversifying patch matches during training. - Developing a confidence-driven reconstruction loss to impose spatial-variant constraints on inpainted regions.- Combining the GMCNN, ID-MRF loss and confidence-driven loss to propagate both global and local contextual information to fill in missing regions.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that modeling global structure and local texture separately using a multi-column CNN along with ID-MRF and spatial-variant losses can achieve improved inpainting results. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GMCNN framework and losses.
