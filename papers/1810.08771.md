# [Image Inpainting via Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08771)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an effective image inpainting method that can generate both visually plausible global structures and realistic local textures in the inpainted regions. 

The key points are:

- Proposing a generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) architecture to model different image components in parallel for inpainting.

- Designing an implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) loss to enhance local texture details by diversifying patch matches during training. 

- Developing a confidence-driven reconstruction loss to impose spatial-variant constraints on inpainted regions.

- Combining the GMCNN, ID-MRF loss and confidence-driven loss to propagate both global and local contextual information to fill in missing regions.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that modeling global structure and local texture separately using a multi-column CNN along with ID-MRF and spatial-variant losses can achieve improved inpainting results. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GMCNN framework and losses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) for image inpainting. The multi-column structure decomposes images into components with different receptive fields to capture both global semantics and local textures. 

2. An implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) regularization that enhances local details by encouraging generated image patches to match different patches from the ground truth during training. This avoids smoothing effects from standard similarity measures.

3. A confidence-driven reconstruction loss that spatially constrains the generation based on distance to known areas, focusing more on consistency near boundaries.

4. Experiments showing the proposed GMCNN with ID-MRF regularization and confidence loss outperforms previous approaches on inpainting tasks for street scenes, faces, objects, etc. The method produces higher quality results with less visual artifacts without any post-processing.

In summary, the main contribution is a new deep generative architecture and training approach for image inpainting that better models global structure along with realistic local texture details. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a generative multi-column convolutional neural network for image inpainting that synthesizes different image components in parallel to better capture global structure and local details.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:

- It proposes a new network architecture - the Generative Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network (GMCNN). This is different from most prior work that uses a single encoder-decoder network or a coarse-to-fine structure. Using multiple columns allows capturing both global semantics and local details.

- The use of the implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) loss is novel. This acts as a regularizer during training to encourage generating diverse textures. Most prior work has used MRF as a post-processing step rather than a loss.

- The confidence-driven reconstruction loss provides a spatial prior that is smoothly varying based on distance to the inpainting boundary. This is more advanced than a simple binary mask or spatial discounting used before.

- It does not require a separate texture synthesis or patch search step like some prior methods. The whole model is trainable end-to-end.

- It achieves visually compelling inpainting results on challenging datasets without post-processing. Quantitative results are also strong based on PSNR/SSIM metrics.

- Most similar work is other recent learning-based methods like Context Encoder, Globally and Locally Consistent Image Inpainting, High-Resolution Image Inpainting, and Contextual Attention. But this paper introduces notable architecture and loss differences compared to those.

Overall, I think this paper makes solid contributions in CNN architecture design, regularization, and loss formulation that collectively improve image inpainting quality and advance the state-of-the-art. The results are very impressive given the challenging datasets used.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring other constraints for the inpainting task based on location and content. The authors mention this could improve results, particularly for large-scale diverse datasets like ImageNet where ambiguity in structure and texture is more challenging to resolve.

- Applying the generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) framework to other generation and reconstruction tasks beyond inpainting. The authors propose the GMCNN is able to model different image components well in parallel.

- Investigating the use of different similarity measures and loss functions for the implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) regularization. This could further enhance modeling of realistic textures.

- Evaluating the proposed methods on higher resolution images. The experiments in the paper focus on 256x256 resolution, exploring higher resolutions could further demonstrate benefits.

- Expanding the framework to video inpainting by exploiting temporal relationships in addition to spatial context.

- Considering other ways to model spatially variant constraints for the reconstruction loss, building on the confidence-driven approach presented.

In summary, the main future directions relate to applying the GMCNN framework to other tasks, improving modeling of textures, evaluating on higher resolution inputs, and exploring video and additional spatial constraints. The overall goals would be improving results on diverse datasets and advancing generative modeling capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) for image inpainting. The key ideas are:

1) The GMCNN has multiple parallel encoder-decoder branches that extract features at different scales to capture both global semantics and local textures. 

2) An implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) loss is used during training to encourage the generation of diverse textures by matching to different nearest neighbors in the ground truth image.

3) A confidence-driven reconstruction loss is designed to impose spatial variance, with pixels near the hole boundary more strongly constrained. 

4) Adversarial loss is also used for training.

Extensive experiments on challenging street scenes, faces, and natural images show the proposed GMCNN can generate visually compelling inpainting results with both structure coherence and texture details, without needing post-processing. The multi-column architecture and new losses are shown to be beneficial compared to baseline models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) for image inpainting. The network has multiple parallel encoder-decoder branches that extract features at different scales to capture both global structures and local textures. A new implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) loss is introduced during training to encourage generating diverse textures. It computes relative similarities between neural patches in the generated image and the ground truth, minimizing the loss to create varied details. Additionally, a confidence-driven reconstruction loss is designed to constrain pixels near hole boundaries more than the center. 

For evaluation, the GMCNN achieves visually compelling inpainting results on street views, faces, objects and scenes. It generates suitable global structures and textures without commonly used post-processing. Comparisons to prior methods show improved visual quality and quantitative metrics. Ablation studies validate the multi-column architecture over single encoder-decoders or coarse-to-fine networks. The ID-MRF loss is shown to be important for texture details. The confidence-driven reconstruction loss also outperforms spatial discounting. Limitations include difficulty generalizing to very diverse datasets like ImageNet. Overall, the proposed GMCNN effectively propagates multi-scale context to fill challenging holes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a generative multi-column convolutional neural network (GMCNN) for image inpainting. The key aspects are:

- The GMCNN has multiple encoder-decoder branches that extract features at different scales to capture both global structure and local texture information. The branches are concatenated and decoded to generate the inpainted image.

- An implicit diversified Markov random field (ID-MRF) loss is used during training to encourage the network to generate diverse, realistic textures by matching to nearest neighbors in the ground truth image features. 

- A confidence-driven reconstruction loss is designed to constrain pixels near hole boundaries more than the center, propagating information from known to unknown regions.

- Adversarial losses from global and local discriminators are also used. The multi-column architecture, ID-MRF loss and confidence-driven reconstruction loss allow the model to generate plausible global structure and realistic texture without needing an explicit nearest neighbor search or post-processing.

In summary, the key contribution is the GMCNN architecture and losses that can synthesize both global structure and detailed texture in a single feedforward pass for high quality image inpainting.
