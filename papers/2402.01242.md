# [Two Heads Are Better Than One: Boosting Graph Sparse Training via   Semantic and Topological Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have high computational overheads, dominated by sparse matrix operations during neighborhood aggregation. This hinders their efficiency and deployment, especially on large graphs.
- Prior graph sparsification methods either focus only on topology or semantics. Topology methods underperform on GNNs while semantic methods struggle at high sparsity levels. There is a need to balance both topology and semantics for extreme sparsity.

Method:
- The paper proposes a new concept called Graph Sparse Training (GST) that dynamically manipulates sparsity at the data level during training. 
- GST starts by training on the full graph to capture an anchor graph containing vital topological and semantic information.
- It then prunes the graph to a sparse level and iteratively regrows/prunes edges based on a combined topological eigenvalue-based score and semantic gradient-based score. This aligns the sparse graph to the anchor graph.

Contributions:
- Introduces the innovative concept of Graph Sparse Training to dynamically sparsify graph input itself, while balancing topological and semantic preservation for optimal subgraphs.
- Achieves higher extreme sparsity levels with no performance loss compared to state-of-the-art methods across 6 datasets. 
- Obtains up to 3.42x inference acceleration.
- Successfully aids graph adversarial defense and graph lottery tickets, demonstrating versatility.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through its new GST concept and equilibria principle that properly balances semantics and topology during dynamic graph sparsification. Experiments demonstrate major improvements in achievable sparsity, performance maintenance and computational efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel graph sparsification framework called Graph Sparse Training (GST) that dynamically manipulates sparsity at the data level during training to find extremely sparse yet performant subgraphs, guided by a topology & semantic anchor from initial full graph training and adhering to the introduced Equilibria Sparsification Principle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a new framework called Graph Sparse Training (GST), which dynamically manipulates sparsity at the data level during training to find an optimal sparse subgraph structure. This explores sparse training on graphs for the first time.

2. It introduces the Equilibria Sparsification Principle to guide the graph sparse training process, aiming to balance preservation of both topological and semantic information of the graph. 

3. Extensive experiments show that GST can identify higher-sparsity subgraphs without compromising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also effectively preserves more spectral properties, achieves faster inference speed, and helps tasks like graph adversarial defense and finding graph lottery tickets.

In summary, the key innovation is the concept of graph sparse training, which combines the strengths of topology-based and semantic-based graph sparsification methods to find extremely sparse yet performant subgraphs. The Equilibria principle and experiments demonstrating advantages over existing methods are also notable contributions.
