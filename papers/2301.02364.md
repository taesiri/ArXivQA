# [Object as Query: Lifting any 2D Object Detector to 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new method for multi-view 3D object detection called MV2D. The main hypothesis is that exploiting 2D object detections as queries for a 3D detector can improve 3D detection performance compared to using fixed/predefined queries. The key research questions addressed are:- Can generating dynamic object queries in 3D based on 2D detections provide better object location priors compared to fixed sparse queries?- Can focusing each object query's attention on only the relevant image regions for that specific object help the query better localize the object in 3D?- Does using object detections from a 2D detector to guide the 3D detector enable benefiting from advances in 2D detection?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that using 2D detections to guide 3D queries can improve 3D object localization, recall, and overall detection performance. The paper explores this via the proposed MV2D framework.
