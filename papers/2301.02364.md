# [Object as Query: Lifting any 2D Object Detector to 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method for multi-view 3D object detection called MV2D. The main hypothesis is that exploiting 2D object detections as queries for a 3D detector can improve 3D detection performance compared to using fixed/predefined queries. 

The key research questions addressed are:

- Can generating dynamic object queries in 3D based on 2D detections provide better object location priors compared to fixed sparse queries?

- Can focusing each object query's attention on only the relevant image regions for that specific object help the query better localize the object in 3D?

- Does using object detections from a 2D detector to guide the 3D detector enable benefiting from advances in 2D detection?

To summarize, the central hypothesis is that using 2D detections to guide 3D queries can improve 3D object localization, recall, and overall detection performance. The paper explores this via the proposed MV2D framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new framework MV2D that can lift any 2D object detector to multi-view 3D object detection. This allows MV2D to leverage advances in 2D detection for 3D detection.

2. It demonstrates that using dynamic object queries conditioned on 2D detections, instead of fixed queries, improves 3D detection performance. The dynamic queries help recall objects better and provide more precise localization. 

3. It proposes a sparse cross attention module where each query only attends to relevant image features based on the 2D detection. This focuses the query on distinct object information and prevents interference from background.

4. It achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance on the nuScenes dataset, outperforming previous methods like DETR3D, PETR, and BEV-based methods.

5. It shows the framework can generalize to different 2D detectors like Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOX, highlighting its flexibility.

In summary, the key ideas are leveraging 2D detections to generate better 3D queries, attending to relevant features only, and showing strong performance and generalizability of the proposed MV2D framework. The paper demonstrates the benefit of utilizing 2D semantic information to guide 3D detection.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new 3D object detection method called MV2D that lifts any 2D object detector to multi-view 3D detection by generating dynamic object queries in 3D space based on 2D detections and using a sparse cross attention module to focus each query on relevant image features.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in multi-view 3D object detection:

- This paper proposes a new method called MV2D that lifts any 2D object detector to multi-view 3D detection. Many existing works focus on either designing new 3D architectures from scratch or adapting single-view methods to multi-view setting. MV2D provides a novel perspective of exploiting advances in 2D detection for 3D detection.

- Unlike methods that rely on dense queries or dense 3D space representations, MV2D uses sparse dynamic queries generated from 2D detections. This helps reduce computation cost and enables focusing on relevant image regions. Other sparse query-based methods like DETR3D and PETR use fixed queries which may cause missing objects. 

- MV2D achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes dataset compared to previous works, improving mAP by 2.6-5% over methods like PETRv2, PolarFormer, BEVFormer. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The idea of generating queries from 2D detection is simple yet effective. This helps incorporate rich image semantics for better object recall. The design of sparse attention and relevant feature selection further boosts 3D localization accuracy.

- A limitation is that MV2D relies on 2D detection results, so any failure cases of 2D detector may propagate to 3D detection. But overall, it shows exploiting 2D detection advances can benefit 3D detection.

In summary, MV2D explores a novel direction to bridge 2D and 3D detection. The intuitive idea coupled with sparse attention design leads to improved performance over other state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the potential of transferring 2D progress to advance multi-view 3D detection.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Improving the 2D object detector used in MV2D. Since MV2D relies on 2D detections to generate 3D object queries, advances in 2D detectors could directly benefit the 3D detection performance of MV2D. They suggest exploring more advanced 2D detectors.

- Handling failure cases of MV2D. The authors analyze some failure cases where heavily occluded objects are missed by the 2D detector, leading to false negatives in MV2D. Improving occlusion and small object handling could help address these issues.

- Exploiting temporal information. The authors show multi-frame input can improve performance, indicating temporal information is useful. More advanced methods to leverage temporal cues across frames could further enhance results.

- Generalizing to new scenarios. While MV2D achieves good results on nuScenes, evaluating it on more diverse and challenging datasets could reveal limitations. Research on improving generalization ability to new environments is suggested.

- Combining with other paradigms. The authors propose fusing 2D detection with sparse 3D queries. Exploring integration with other paradigms like dense 3D detection could be interesting future work.

In summary, the key future directions are improving the 2D detector, handling failure cases, exploiting temporal information, generalizing to new scenarios, and combining MV2D with complementary 3D detection paradigms. The overall goal is pushing the envelope of camera-based 3D detection via these research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D) for multi-view 3D object detection. MV2D first runs a 2D detector on each input view image to generate 2D detections. Then it creates a 3D object query for each 2D detection and selects the relevant features from the multi-view images based on the 2D boxes and camera configurations. These dynamic object queries and relevant features are fed into a transformer decoder to update the query features. Finally, the queries predict the 3D bounding boxes. Compared to using fixed object queries, MV2D can better recall objects and focus on useful features. Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate MV2D achieves state-of-the-art performance. The main contributions are proposing the idea of lifting 2D detectors to 3D detection, showing the benefits of dynamic object queries and relevant feature selection, and achieving strong results on a standard benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes MV2D, a method for multi-view 3D object detection that exploits 2D object detections to generate dynamic object queries. Most prior work uses a fixed set of object queries distributed in 3D space. However, MV2D generates queries conditioned on input images by detecting objects in 2D and lifting them to 3D. This allows the model to dynamically generate queries that cover objects in the actual scene. 

MV2D first runs an off-the-shelf 2D detector like Faster R-CNN on multi-view images. It generates a 3D reference point for each 2D detection using camera geometry. These points serve to initialize dynamic object queries in 3D space. The queries interact with image features from their relevant regions based on the 2D boxes. This focuses each query's attention on distinctive object features in the images. A transformer decoder refines the queries, which are used to predict 3D boxes. Experiments on nuScenes show MV2D outperforms prior work. The dynamic queries improve recall and localization while reducing interference from background. MV2D serves as a new strong baseline that benefits from advances in both 2D detection and transformer architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D) for multi-view 3D object detection. The key idea is to leverage 2D object detectors to generate dynamic object queries for the 3D detector, instead of using fixed object queries. 

Specifically, it first runs a 2D object detector on multi-view images to obtain 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D detection, it generates a 3D reference point which serves to produce an object query. This results in dynamic object queries based on input images. Then for each query, it selects relevant features from multi-view images based on the 2D detections and camera parameters. The queries interact with selected relevant features through a transformer decoder to predict 3D boxes. By exploiting 2D detections to guide query generation and feature aggregation, MV2D can better localize objects in 3D and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of 3D object detection from multi-view images. Specifically, it aims to lift 2D object detectors to perform 3D detection by exploiting 2D detections as guidance. The key questions it tries to answer are:

1. How can we leverage 2D detections to generate better object queries for 3D detection instead of using fixed/predefined queries? 

2. How can we make the 3D object queries focus on relevant object features from the multi-view images rather than aggregating everything?

3. Can dynamically generating queries conditioned on input images and restricting their attention improve 3D detection performance compared to prior arts?

In summary, the paper proposes a new method called MV2D that generates dynamic object queries in 3D based on 2D detections and uses a sparse cross-attention mechanism to aggregate only relevant features for each query. It aims to demonstrate that this approach can effectively lift 2D detectors to 3D detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
